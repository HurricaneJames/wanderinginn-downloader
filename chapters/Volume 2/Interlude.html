<p><strong>[15 Users Connected]</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>[Squirtle344] </strong>&nbsp;– Lol. Another one!</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – Rose, welcome. Glad you made it.</p>
<p><strong>[batman]</strong> – SUP.</p>
<p><strong>[Rose]</strong> – Okaaaaaay. Magical floating screen. o.o</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – That was the last one in several minutes. Looks like most of us are here so do we want to get things started?</p>
<p><strong>[plusOne]</strong> – what is this?? how is this happening?</p>
<p><strong>[Level 12 Warrior]</strong> – ikr? Floating screen popped up after I answered the phone. i nearly died!</p>
<p><strong>[Rose]</strong> – Is this some kind of Skype call?</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – More like a magical chatroom. I’m not sure how this is possible, though.</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – Right, let me start things off. I’m uh, the one who set all this up. We’re all connected by magic.</p>
<p><strong>[Squirtle344] </strong>&nbsp;– bull</p>
<p><strong>[50fiftyCents]</strong> – no its true i can detect magic with my skill</p>
<p><strong>[twinTrouble_53]</strong> – Still impossible. How is this happening?</p>
<p><strong>[batman]</strong> – iPhones r magic. duh. apple has wizards.</p>
<p><strong>[America Group]</strong> – Hold on, let’s let BlackMage speak.</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – I managed to link up our phones, but it takes a LOT of magical power to do this. And I thought having a bunch of voices would be too confusing so we’re in chat.</p>
<p><strong>[twinTrouble_53]</strong> – How much power?</p>
<p><strong>[batman]</strong> – over 9000 lol.</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – I hope we can use this as a way to communicate and make sense of things here.</p>
<p><strong>[Loran Grimnar]</strong> – Not many people here. Is it because of distance?</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – Shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – Maybe this only works with iPhones?</p>
<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – everyone is dead. we are the only survivors!</p>
<p><strong>[50fiftyCents]</strong> – fuck android users man. Their loss.</p>
<p><strong>[asdf]</strong> – send help pls!</p>
<p><strong>[America Group]</strong> – Let’s all calm down and try to make sense of things. If we all type no one will be able to understand anything.</p>
<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – who make u the leader?</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – I think he’s right. We should start with basics.</p>
<p><strong>[Rose]</strong> – What basics? I’m sitting in a forest in THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. I haven’t seen anyone except monsters for DAYS!</p>
<p><strong>[asdf]</strong> – help</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – What, really? I’m in a city right now with some other people who got teleported with me.</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – Really? Where?</p>
<p><strong>[Kent Scott]</strong> – Does this city have a name?</p>
<p><strong>[America Group]</strong> – HOLD ON. Let’s start with basic information. Where are all of you?</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – I’m in the Adventurer’s Guild in my city. Pentagost.</p>
<p><strong>[Rose]</strong> – I’m in a forest, like I said. I have no idea where I am.</p>
<p><strong>[batman]</strong> – this is a trap lol.</p>
<p><strong>[twinTrouble_53]</strong> – It’s not a trap. What makes you think that?</p>
<p><strong>[plusOne]</strong> – who CARES? if you can send us a message, can you send us home?</p>
<p><strong>[Squirtle344] </strong>&nbsp;– omg pls!</p>
<p><strong>[Level 12 Warrior]</strong> – yes.</p>
<p><strong>[asdf]</strong> – yes do it please!</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – I can’t do that. This is all I can do. I don’t even know what sent us here.</p>
<p><strong>[50fiftyCents]</strong> – damn</p>
<p><strong>[Squirtle344] </strong>&nbsp;– i want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>[America Group]</strong> – Not much we can do about that now. Priorities should be linking up &amp; sharing information to survive.</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – In that case, start with levels and classes.</p>
<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – why?</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – Good information to know. I’m a Level 16 [Ranger], by the way.</p>
<p><strong>[Rose]</strong> – Classes? What?</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – Not bad. I’m a Level 11 [Engineer] at the moment, and Level 8 [Mage]. That’s how I set up this call.</p>
<p><strong>[Loran Grimnar]</strong> – What?? You can become a ENGINEER?</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – Seems like it. I took apart my iPhone and some of my electronics and got the class.</p>
<p><strong>[twinTrouble_53]</strong> – Whoa, electronics? You have more stuff?</p>
<p><strong>[batman]</strong> – when r you gonna get [Technomage] class?</p>
<p><strong>[Level 12 Warrior]</strong> – There’s a [Technomage] class???? How do u get it?</p>
<p><strong>[plusOne]</strong> – hes just trollin. ignore him.</p>
<p><strong>[50fiftyCents]</strong> – Level 10 [Mage] here. Magic is AWESOME!</p>
<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – ive just been running away from everything ur killing monsters??? level 4 traveler level 1 trader</p>
<p><strong>[America Group]</strong> – I am a Level 26 [Knight]. Others with me are [Assassin], [Pyromancer], [Beast Tamer], [Tactician], [Fist Fighter], etc…and one [Clown].</p>
<p><strong>[Squirtle344] </strong>&nbsp;– wut.</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – Get out.</p>
<p><strong>[twinTrouble_53]</strong> – Do you have a list of all the classes?</p>
<p><strong>[Kent Scott]</strong> – How many people are with you? What are their names?</p>
<p><strong>[plusOne]</strong> – no wey. u can’t be 26</p>
<p><strong>[America Group]</strong> – I am.</p>
<p><strong>[batman]</strong> – i am [Dark Avenger]. level 999999.</p>
<p><strong>[Level 12 Warrior]</strong> – Impossible. How did u level so fast? I’ve been killing monsters every day as an adventurer, and I’m only a Level 12 [Warrior].</p>
<p><strong>[America Group]</strong> – It seems like our summoning spell blessed us in some way. We all gained the [Hero] class when we were summoned, but none of us have managed to progress it past Level 1 that I know of. It seems to make us all level up faster.</p>
<p><strong>[batman]</strong> – gtfo. pics or it didn’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – Some people on my end are telling me that no one’s gotten the [Hero] class in centuries. What kingdom is this?</p>
<p><strong>[Loran Grimnar]</strong> – Wait a second. Slow down. SUMMONED????</p>
<p><strong>[America Group]</strong> – Weren’t all of you summoned here?</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – No.</p>
<p><strong>[Squirtle344] </strong>&nbsp;– no.</p>
<p><strong>[batman]</strong> – i’m the chosen one.</p>
<p><strong>[Loran Grimnar]</strong> – We arrived in a storm. Half of us FELL down a cliff on our first night!</p>
<p><strong>[Rose]</strong> – I woke up here! No idea what happened!</p>
<p><strong>[asdf]</strong> – help please!</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – Backtrack to the Level 26 part. I’ve been here for two weeks. How the fuck did you get that high so fast?</p>
<p><strong>[Squirtle344] </strong>&nbsp;– language.</p>
<p><strong>[batman]</strong> – shut up fag.</p>
<p><strong>[plusOne]</strong> – omg. can we block u?</p>
<p><strong>[Loran Grimnar]</strong> – Two weeks? I’ve been here way longer than that!</p>
<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – wait. ive been here for three months.</p>

<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – This is important! What’s the last big thing you all remember from our world?</p>
<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – um. the election?</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – Did it already take place?</p>
<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – no, i meant we were still in the primaries. TRUMP just got nominated for republicans.</p>
<p><strong>[Loran Grimnar]</strong> – Hold it. The election’s over. Way over.</p>
<p><strong>[Squirtle344] </strong>&nbsp;– No way.</p>
<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – liar</p>
<p><strong>[Loran Grimnar]</strong> – I’m serious. It was just after Christmas when I got abducted.</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – There’s a huge time difference here, it seems.</p>
<p><strong>[America Group]</strong> – Wait, if the election’s over, who won?</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – Hillary, duh.</p>
<p><strong>[Rose]</strong> – No. It was Trump!</p>
<p><strong>[plusOne]</strong> – omfg no way yESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS</p>
<p><strong>[Level 12 Warrior]</strong> – America is doomed.</p>
<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – glad im here.</p>
<p><strong>[50fiftyCents]</strong> – shut up! Trump is 100000X better than lyin hillary.</p>
<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – aaaand now the idiots appear. good luck i hope a monster eats you.</p>
<p><strong>[plusOne]</strong> – fuck u liberals</p>
<p><strong>[Loran Grimnar]</strong> – WHO CARES? THIS ISNT AMERICA!!</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – I’m not even American.</p>
<p><strong>[Squirtle344] </strong>&nbsp;– wut</p>
<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – seriously?</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – Yeah. I’m from Australia. What about everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>[plusOne]</strong> – u don’t sound australian.</p>

<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – WUTTTT</p>
<p><strong>[Level 12 Warrior]</strong> – i thought everyone was American! hey there!</p>
<p><strong>[America Group]</strong> – I’m with a group of Americans over here. We’re from all over the continent, though.</p>
<p><strong>[plusOne]</strong> – you and your ‘summoning spell’ right</p>
<p><strong>[America Group]</strong> – Not a lie.</p>
<p><strong>[Loran Grimnar]</strong> – Who’s from America? Me.</p>
<p><strong>[50fiftyCents]</strong> – America! FUCK YEAH!</p>
<p><strong>[Rose]</strong> – I’m from California.</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – Okay, so we’re from everywhere. I’m from America too, by the way. But back to when we arrived. How long have all of you been here?</p>
<p><strong>[Loran Grimnar]</strong> – Maybe four weeks? It gets hard to tell.</p>
<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – seventy eight days.</p>
<p><strong>[batman]</strong> – forever</p>
<p><strong>[plusOne]</strong> – a month? not sure.</p>
<p><strong>[Rose]</strong> – A week.</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – Wow. Really?</p>
<p><strong>[Rose]</strong> – Yeah, I just got here and I’m flipping out.</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – Wait, what’s the last thing you remember from home?</p>
<p><strong>[Rose]</strong> – Um. Last thing? It’s really hard to remember. Trump banned all Muslims, but it got blocked by the judicial courts. That’s the biggest thing.</p>
<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – omg. Hitler’s back with a wig!</p>
<p><strong>[50fiftyCents]</strong> – don’t be stupid. the muslim ban was a long time coming. Obama should have done it if he weren’t a traitor.</p>
<p><strong>[America Group]</strong> – I’m Muslim. Several people in my group are, too.</p>
<p><strong>[batman]</strong> – BURNED</p>
<p><strong>[50fiftyCents]</strong> – i don’t mean all muslims are bad. but a lot of you are terrorists. we’ve got to protect Americans first.</p>
<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – so racist.</p>
<p><strong>[50fiftyCents]</strong> – Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – Let’s all STOP with the politics. We have a lot more to cover.</p>
<p><strong>[Kent Scott]</strong> – Indeed. We should all meet up.</p>
<p><strong>[plusOne]</strong> – where?</p>
<p><strong>[Level 12 Warrior]</strong> – more like how</p>
<p><strong>[Kent Scott]</strong> – I am in a well-protected city. If we meet where I am we will be safe.</p>
<p><strong>[plusOne]</strong> – yes pls!</p>
<p><strong>[Rose]</strong> – I don’t know where I am.</p>
<p><strong>[Kent Scott]</strong> – Tell me what cities you all are in, or what continent.</p>
<p><strong>[America Group]</strong> – Our group is in Karas, a city in the Blighted Continent.</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – I’ve heard of that place. It’s constantly at war, right?</p>
<p><strong>[Kent Scott]</strong> – Where are the rest of you?</p>

<p><strong>[plusOne]</strong>&nbsp; – wtf is wrong with you? We’re all in this together.</p>
<p><strong>[batman]</strong> – u could all be fake.</p>
<p><strong>[Loran Grimnar]</strong> – Fake? What the hell are you on?</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – There are multiple continents on this planet, and this place is HUGE. I’m not sure we can meet so easily even if we know where everyone is.</p>
<p><strong>[America Group]</strong> – Agreed. There’s a lot of extremely dangerous monsters where we are. Not a safe place.</p>
<p><strong>[Kent Scott]</strong> – Tell me where the rest of you are.</p>
<p><strong>[asdf]</strong> – help us please!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>[Loran Grimnar]</strong> – This is such a clusterfuck.</p>
<p><strong>[America Group]</strong> – Let’s try to organize. We should start with a basic description from everyone. Write down your name, location, classes, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>[Kent Scott]</strong> – That is a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>[asdf]</strong> – HELP</p>

<p><strong>[asdf]</strong> – howW?????? WE HAVE NO WEAPONS</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – Damn it.</p>
<p><strong>[Kent Scott]</strong> – Describe where you are.</p>
<p><strong>[batman]</strong> – To exit the simulation, please type ‘EXIT’ without the quotation marks in the chat box and hit send. A virtual aide will be sent to you momentarily to begin the extraction process.</p>
<p><strong>[50fiftyCents]</strong> – EXIT</p>
<p><strong>[plusOne]</strong> – exit</p>
<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – EXIT</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – You trolling bastard.</p>

<p><strong>[Loran Grimnar]</strong> – Jesus. Can we kick batman off the chat? Or at least mute him or something?</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – Sorry. The system isn’t built that way.</p>
<p><strong>[Prophet]</strong> – Do not take the Lord’s Name in vain.</p>
<p><strong>[batman]</strong> – wut? lol</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – Seriously batman, if you can’t contribute anything, please keep silent.</p>
<p><strong>[Loran Grimnar]</strong> – Agreed.</p>
<p><strong>[Squirtle344] </strong>&nbsp;– totally. shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>[batman]</strong> – ur all haters. u don’t know anything.</p>

<p><strong>[Prophet]</strong> – Pray for Salvation and His Hand shall shelter you.</p>
<p><strong>[Loran Grimnar]</strong> – …And now we’ve got crazies running around. Wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>[Level 12 Warrior]</strong> – dude, shut up. we don’t need two worlds with your bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>[Prophet]</strong> – All those who pray shall be Saved by the Lord our God.</p>
<p><strong>[Kent Scott]</strong> – We must focus. Tell us your names. First name and last name.</p>
<p><strong>[Squirtle344] </strong>&nbsp;– y?</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – Zara Walker.</p>

<p><strong>[50fiftyCents]</strong> – Ridley Wallis</p>
<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – Thompson Green</p>
<p><strong>[batman]</strong> – Bruce Wayne</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – This isn’t what we should be focusing on.</p>
<p><strong>[America Group]</strong> – Agreed. We should be sharing information. Survival tips. Anything you know?</p>
<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – how do u do magic?</p>
<p><strong>[batman]</strong> – with a wand. duh</p>
<p><strong>[plusOne]</strong> – shut up.</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – You need to be activated. Not everyone has the potential to do magic, but another magic-user needs to test you.</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – Important tips? Seems like leveling in this world is based on adversity, not repetition?</p>
<p><strong>[50fiftyCents]</strong> – what? ENGLISH.</p>
<p><strong>[Loran Grimnar]</strong> – She means that you can’t grind. But is that true?</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – Seems like it. The bigger the challenges, the faster I’ve leveled.</p>
<p><strong>[America Group]</strong> – I can confirm that.</p>
<p><strong>[plusOne]</strong> – weird. Can u game the system?</p>
<p><strong>[Loran Grimnar]</strong> – If we could, that would be amazing.</p>

<p><strong>[America Group]</strong> – Welcome s.</p>
<p><strong>[Level 12 Warrior]</strong> – i know how to game the system. multiple classes. the more you have, the more skills you get!</p>
<p><strong>[Loran Grimnar]</strong> – Acquiring new classes is hard. I don’t have more than 3.</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – This is so unfocused. Can we split up the chat somehow?</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – I’m sorry, this is the best I can do.</p>
<p><strong>[Kent Scott]</strong> – s, what is your first and last name? Where are you from?</p>
<p><strong>[s]</strong> – ?</p>

<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – Hang on, I think I can use Google Translate.</p>

<p><strong>[batman]</strong> – पसंदीदा फिल्म पूछें go fuck yourself</p>
<p><strong>[plusOne]</strong> – omg stfu!</p>
<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – please tell me we can kick batman</p>
<p><strong>[Level 12 Warrior]</strong> – it all makes sense. hes some dude who doesn’t know English trolling around.</p>
<p><strong>[Loran Grimnar]</strong> – Damnit. Can we just FOCUS for one second?</p>
<p><strong>[Kent Scott]</strong> – Agreed.</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – Actually, I’ve got a better idea. Everyone name one of your favorite movies. It’s very important. Mine was the fourth Harry Potter movie.</p>
<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – wut?</p>

<p><strong>[batman]</strong> – BATMAN! THE DARK KNIGHT BITCHES!</p>
<p><strong>[plusOne]</strong> – everything u say makes me feel like i have cancer. The Matrix.</p>
<p><strong>[Kent Scott]</strong> – Spiderman was my favorite movie as well.</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – Prophet?</p>
<p><strong>[Prophet]</strong> – The only Truth is the will of God, not baser delights.</p>
<p><strong>[America Group]</strong> – We need to know.</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – Tell us.</p>
<p><strong>[Prophet]</strong> – Before I heard the Voice and was Reborn I watched movies such as The Ten Commandments. Is that what you wish to know?</p>
<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – Yes, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>[America Group]</strong> – I see.</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – Got it.</p>

<p><strong>[BlackMage]</strong> – Whoever this ‘Kent Scott’ is, they’re not from our world. How did you get that iPhone?</p>
<p><strong>[ayan]</strong> – omg</p>

<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>[Kent Scott]</strong> – I found this device by accident.</p>
<p><strong>[strider_479]</strong> – Bullshit. How did you figure out the password?</p>

<p><strong>[Kent Scott]</strong> – Well, well. How inconvenient. Can I persuade you to stay, twinTrouble_53? I mean you no harm.</p>
<p><strong>[twinTrouble_53]</strong> – Liar. And it is not twinTrouble you speak to anymore.</p>
<p><strong>[Kent Scott]</strong> – Ah. Someone else?</p>
<p><strong>[twinTrouble_53]</strong> – I am Flos.</p>
<p><strong>[Kent Scott]</strong> – My. I would bow before you had I legs.</p>
<p><strong>[twinTrouble_53]</strong> – Name yourself, thief.</p>
<p><strong>[Kent Scott]</strong> – I am no one. Certainly not anyone to trouble the sleeping king.</p>
<p><strong>[twinTrouble_53]</strong> – I sleep no longer. Thus I issue you a warning, thief. To you and to Wistram and all the mages who cower behind spell and door. Know that I, Flos, have returned. Those who would oppose me, tremble for all that I see will be mine. I will come for you and break down your craven towers and unmask those who would hide.</p>
<p><strong>[twinTrouble_53]</strong> – I am Flos.</p>
<p><strong>[twinTrouble_53]</strong> – I have returned.</p>
<p><strong>[Kent Scott]</strong> – Then let us see what the King of Destruction brings. Until then.</p>
