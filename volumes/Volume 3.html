		<p>I don’t dream of seeing. But I do dream of adventures. I think every boy does, and I never forgot that dream even when I grew older.</p>
<p>Yet it’s one thing to imagine being transported into another dimension or to another world, and quite another thing if it actually happens. Upon reflection, I think I would have rather eaten my quiche instead before I left, but we can’t have everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>When I found myself in another world, I picked up on it right away for a number of reasons. First: I’m pretty darn sure that a food court doesn’t have grass inside of it, or trees. Second, it just felt different.</p>
<p>The air smelled strange to me immediately. You think I would have noticed the sun on my skin, but it was the stark difference in the way the wind smelled to me that stood out first. It’s like…honestly, it’s like the difference between living in a polluted city like New York – no, scratch that, somewhere <em>really</em> polluted like Hong Kong or Beijing – for a few months and then going somewhere where the air is pure and clean.</p>
<p>There is a quality to the air. In bad places like airports, it smells sterilized and stale, and that goes double for airplanes. In a polluted place, it’s more pervasive than anything else; after a while you get used to it, but then the fog is in your lungs, making even breathing harder than it should be.</p>
<p>The difference between clean air and polluted air is tangible even to people who don’t take that much notice of it. But the difference between the relatively clean food court and the place I was now in?</p>
<p>Unimaginable.</p>
<p>I look around, the bacon quiche still in one hand, my walking stick in the other. I feel like I should be freaking out but honestly, I don’t want to start running about. I can’t tell what’s around me right now except that I’m now standing on the grass, and I’d hate to run into a tree, if there are any in the area.</p>
<p>If you haven’t guessed by now, I’m blind. That’s not legally blind, of which there are many variations. I mean I see nothing. Not blackness, not a distinction between light and dark—nothing. That’s fine by me, but most people I’ve met make a big deal about it.</p>
<p>Normally, I get on just fine no matter where I go. I have good friends, my parents are overprotective, and I can always ask for directions or help in a pinch.</p>
<p>Which would be now. The only problem is, I’m getting the distinct impression I’m alone. My best friend Zoe is <em>not</em> sitting at a table a few feet ahead of me, and I can hear birds.</p>
<p>I sweep the ground cautiously around me with my cane, pausing as I feel dirt at the tip and grass. That’s definitely not ceramic tiles. Either someone’s playing an amazing prank on me or—</p>
<p>“Hello? Zoe? Is anyone there?”</p>
<p>No response. This is like a bad dream, the kind I used to have as a kid where I’m lost in a huge building with no cane and no one around me. Only then I kept imagining something was sneaking up on me and it was dark.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>This…place is clearly somewhere in the light. I can feel sunshine on my skin, and I’m pretty sure it’s early morning judging by the dew on the grass. I know that because I’ve sat down.</p>
<p>Some people freak out when the unexpected happens. If I were someone else I might run around screaming, or panic. But being blind means that you learn bumping into things at high speeds is a bad idea. Plus, I still have the quiche in my hand.</p>
<p>I rest it on my lap as I sit to think. Well, I’m somewhere else. Not in the mall. I might have suspected a prank, but Zoe isn’t nearly that cruel, and it’s not as if I’ve blacked out or been distracted. I literally just took a step and found myself…</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>“Is it a forest? Or a meadow? A hiking trail?”</p>
<p>I touch gingerly at the grass and ground. Yep. That feels like morning dew. The grass is long and uncut—another sign? I’m not on someone’s lawn here. And then I find a flower.</p>
<p>It feels soft under my fingertips. The petals nearly stick to my skin, and I recoil when I realize the head of the flower is <em>wet.</em> What kind of flower is this? Has a bird or something pooped on it?</p>
<p>“…No. Nectar.”</p>
<p>It smells sweet and odd, and like <em>nothing</em> I’ve ever smelled in my world. Already I’m at the other world conclusion, but this time I’m pretty damn sure.</p>
<p>The flower smells spicy-sweet, but also <em>dark</em> if that makes sense. It smells dark like I imagine the shade appears to people—not that I’ve ever seen it for myself. But I can imagine the shade—a wet, creeping thing as wide as an ocean that sucks up sunlight. That’s closest to the smell of this flower.</p>
<p>It’s like nothing I’ve ever smelled before, and I have a good memory. I’ve visited huge greenhouses and even flower gardens across different countries in the world – the Keukenhof Gardens in the Netherlands were my favorite – and never come across this unique smell.</p>
<p>Cautiously, I reach down and pick the flower. I feel a bit bad, but I have to touch it, feel it. I’m aware it could be poisonous, but I don’t care. I smell it again, and this time realize the center of the flower was indeed sticky with that nectar.</p>
<p>Do I dare taste it? No, that’s probably too risky. But that adds to my theory. I am somewhere else, and something…strange has happened to me.</p>
<p>“Magic? Teleportation? Some kind of ultra-vivid hallucination?”</p>
<p>It can’t be real. But some part of me whispers ‘yes it is’. Yes it is.</p>
<p>This is real. You’re in another world.</p>
<p>And that makes me smile. Even if the curtain falls down in the next second or it turns out I’m being tricked. For a second I believe.</p>
<p>The air smells different. Cleaner. Sweeter, even. For that matter, even the sunlight feels…odd. I could have sworn it was quite warm in San Francisco—warm enough that Zoe and I went into a mall to cool down. But today feels like a crisp autumn day.</p>
<p>A breeze ruffles my hair. I smell grass and that strange otherworldly smell of flowers I’ve never seen before. And I hear a bird warbling off in the distance. That at least sounds normal.</p>
<p>It’s such a pleasant day. I could get up and walk into uncertainty, but right here the grass is soft. It could be I’m sitting right at the edge of a cliff and I’d never know. But here is nice.</p>
<p>How long did I sit there, holding the quiche in my lap, just listening to the wind and birds? An hour, maybe. I sat and listened and grew more and more convinced that I was somewhere else. Somewhere special.</p>
<p>That’s when I heard the voice. It was distant at first, and then grew louder, accompanied to the sound of branches crackling. <em>Something </em>wails and I hear a <em>thud</em> off somewhere behind me and to the left.</p>
<p>I get a bit worried. Okay, stepping into another world is a jarring experience, but I was keeping calm by rationalizing it as a Platform 9 and ¾’s experience. But no one wants to meet a monster.</p>
<p>Or a bear. Forest + large thing = bear in my mind. But this bear has a voice. And it’s upset.</p>
<p>Behind me, I hear the thing stop, and then hear what sounds like sobbing. That’s reassuring for me, but then I practically feel something punch something else. It sounds like a tree from all the branches rustling from the impact.</p>
<p>Is it a person? I listen hard. Contrary to public belief, being blind does <em>not</em> confer supernatural senses to me. I just use what I have more efficiently. I can sort out the sounds—yes, someone’s crying. They’ve got a deep voice which is why it sounded so odd. And they’re hiccuping.</p>
<p>I already feel a bit sympathetic for this person caught in their grief, although the <em>thumping</em> aspect I don’t like. If they’re hitting that tree, then I’m listening to it <em>splinter</em> from the impacts.</p>
<p>But there’s no helping it. I stand up and raise my voice.</p>
<p>“Hello? Is anyone there? Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Immediately the crying stops. I hear what sounds like the intake of breath. I call out again, turning towards where I heard the person.</p>
<p>“I think I’m lost. I’m sorry, but could I ask you for some help?”</p>
<p>“Help? I’m coming!”</p>
<p>It <em>is</em> a person! I never thought that would be the highlight of my day. But not only is it a person, it’s apparently a female person. At least, that’s what she sounds like. But she has a very deep voice; not that I object to that. Her voice sounds soothing.</p>
<p>Immediately after she speaks, the mysterious person runs over to me. I hear her crashing through branches as she makes a beeline in my direction.</p>
<p>“I’m here! What’s the prob—oh!”</p>
<p>Her footsteps make the ground tremble just a bit as she walks closer. I hold my ground and sense her as best I can.</p>
<p>Heavy. She’s definitely that. And big; that’s my general impression. And she smells. Not bad per se; but she smells…not exactly normal, I guess is the best way I could describe it. She’s certainly perspiring a bit, but that’s not unpleasant.</p>
<p>And then she speaks again, and I hear the worry in her tone. Her voice is deep but smooth, and she has good diction; it’s rare to hear someone enunciate as well as she does.</p>
<p>“I’m here. Are you lost, stranger? Are your eyes hurt? You have them closed.”</p>
<p>“What? No. I’m—”</p>
<p>I lift my cane a bit and I can <em>feel</em> her recoil backwards. I hear her take a step back. Did she think I was going to hit her? I lower the cane and raise a hand.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I’m blind. This is my walking cane.”</p>
<p>“You can’t see?”</p>
<p>The voice sounds shocked. She didn’t recognize my cane, either. It’s pretty universal—am I <em>really</em> in another world?</p>
<p>“Not at all. I can’t see you, but I can hear you.”</p>
<p>An intake of breath. I feel like whoever’s standing in front of me is huge; or at least their lungs are.</p>
<p>“You can’t see my face?”</p>
<p>“No. Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>Silence. And then—</p>
<p>“No. Nothing’s wrong.”</p>
<p>I smile. I’m not sure if I’m smiling at her, but it helps. It always does.</p>
<p>“That’s good. I heard you and didn’t want to interrupt, but I am in a bit of trouble. My name is Laken Godart.”</p>
<p>I offer my hand, and I sense hesitation. But then a hand engulfs mine.</p>
<p>A big hand. But it gives my hand such a delicate squeeze that I barely feel a thing.</p>
<p>“My name is Durene. How did you end up here, Mister Laken?”</p>
<p>Mr. Laken? How odd. Is there any country I know of that uses that kind of title? I smile ruefully.</p>
<p>“I’m not quite sure how I got here. I was at a mall, and I must have turned the wrong corner? Something happened because I was suddenly walking around here.”</p>
<p>“Mall? I’ve never heard of that town. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>My eyebrows shoot up. Either she’s a brilliant actor and this is the greatest simulation of all time, or she’s serious.</p>
<p>“Can you tell me where I am?”</p>
<p>I think she nods. I’ve been told people do that a lot although I only understood the gesture after someone showed me exactly what they were doing with their head.</p>
<p>“You’re near the village of Riverfarm. In the forest, actually.”</p>
<p>Riverfarm? At least I was right about the forest bit.</p>
<p>“Is that near a city? I was in San Francisco just now and I have no idea how I got here.”</p>
<p>Another pause.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but I don’t know where that is. Is it a big city?”</p>
<p>“Very big. What’s the biggest city near here?”</p>
<p>“That would be Bells. It’s over thirty miles away, though.”</p>
<p>“…Is that anywhere in America?”</p>
<p>“America?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This is probably just a dream. Or a mental breakdown, although the psychiatrist my mom hired gave me a clean bill of health for the last few years. This is any number of things, but what I really want, a tiny bit, is for this to be real.</p>
<p>“Sorry Durene, I’m going to go out on a limb here, but…could you tell me what the year is? And what nation I’m in?”</p>
<p>“Nation? Year? I—don’t keep track of the years. I think we’re around 22 A.F.? And, um, we’re not in a nation. No one rules Riverfarm but the village head.”</p>
<p>“Oh my god. I <em>am</em> in another world.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I must be. Durene, do I look…unusual to you?”</p>
<p>A pause. I can feel her drawing slowly closer. I can’t tell, but I think she’s looking me over.</p>
<p>“Well…you dress a bit oddly. You have unusual clothing. There’s a strange symbol of a triangle on your shirt. It looks…colorful.”</p>
<p>I smile, a tiny bit. Being blind means my fashion sense is a bit skewed. I know I’m wearing shorts and a t-shirt, apparently with a logo of the Illuminati eye on it. Zoe told me it looked good, but I have reason to doubt her fashion sense.</p>
<p>“Have you ever seen anything like it before?”</p>
<p>“Not so vividly. Are you a noble? A merchant who sells fabric?”</p>
<p>“No. I’m just blind. And I think—yeah, I think I’m very far from home.”</p>
<p>“Oh. I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>I shrug.</p>
<p>“It’s not your fault. I think. If it is, I’d love an explanation?”</p>
<p>“What? No! I’d never—”</p>
<p>She’s so easily distressed. That makes me feel a bit guilty.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. It was a joke.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>What to say? I’m usually a decent conversationalist. Or at least, I can always find something to talk about even if it’s not well received.</p>
<p>“I heard you crying. Are <em>you</em> alright?”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>I’ve heard of a blush as well. Based on people’s descriptions and the one time I touched someone while they were blushing, I imagine heat filling their face. That’s certainly how it feels to me, and I suspect, Durene at the moment.</p>
<p>“It—it was nothing. I was just upset, that’s all. I didn’t think anyone was around.”</p>
<p>Her voice is rough with emotion. I pause, but why not follow this? There’s nothing to be gained from holding back. I learned that a long time ago.</p>
<p>“It’s fine if you don’t want to speak about it. But if you want to talk—”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>I nod. But I can feel her hesitating. So I wait.</p>
<p>“Someone called me a name. That’s all.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>So many years, so much feeling can go into a single word. I face in her general direction, and I know she’s looking at me. And then I hear something funny.</p>
<p>Rumbling. Gurgling. A massive stomach. And I remember I do have something in one of my hands. I smile even as I sense Durene shifting and presumably, blushing.</p>
<p>“Durene, would you like to share this quiche with me?”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Why not? Let’s sit and talk. You seem like a nice person.”</p>
<p>I sit down on the ground. After a second, I sense someone sitting next to me. I don’t have a fork, but it’s no trouble to lever the quiche out of the tin container and break it apart. I give the bigger section to Durene over her protests and we eat and sit and talk.</p>
<p>That was how I met Durene, and my introduction to another world. As I said, I would have liked to eat my quiche first. It was only lukewarm at that point, but at least the company was nice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 2</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I woke up, I once again confirmed that I was in another world. I didn’t freak out.</p>
<p>That mildly surprised Durene, when she found I was up and quietly exploring her house. She lives in a rather large house next to a stream. I can’t imagine it as a whole yet, but my exploration and her descriptions of the building give me the sense of a building of wood and rough stone, but carefully patched to avoid the elements or nature getting in. The stone floor is only slightly rough on my bare feet, and the lone window has no glass.</p>
<p>In short, this is a medieval building, and from what Durene told me in our hours-long chat yesterday, this is a medieval world. With magic. And only a limited grasp of technology. She was amazed to see my fiberglass cane; she exclaimed over the material as if it were alien to her world, which it was, in a sense.</p>
<p>Now I sit at a table, feeling like a midget in the chair Durene put me in while she clatters around the kitchen. I can smell something cooking, and it sounds like she’s making eggs. The scent of warm bread is already filling my nostrils.</p>
<p>“Here you are, Mister Laken. I’m sorry it’s a bit burnt.”</p>
<p>“It smells delicious. And call me Laken.”</p>
<p>I hear and feel the big plate being placed in front of me. After cautious exploration with a fork I find the eggs—only slightly runny—and the toasted bread. Yes, it’s crunchy, but it is quite good, and I tell her so.</p>
<p>“Thank you for letting me sleep here. I think I took your only bed. I’m sorry about that.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no! It’s nothing. And I like sleeping outside.”</p>
<p>“Pretty liar.”</p>
<p>Well. I think that’s the first time I’ve ever startled someone into silence so quickly. I hear her shifting, clearing her throat, and then she bursts out.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you worried?”</p>
<p>I raise my eyebrow. I have no idea if it looks good, but friends assured me it did, and I fell in love with the idea after reading a story where the main character did it to great effect.</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“Well, you said you’re lost. Alone. In another…another world? How are you so calm?”</p>
<p>That makes me smile. I may act calm, but I spent a good bit of last night while Durene was snoring outside freaking out and trying to affirm I really wasn’t hallucinating. I have a sore arm from all the times I’ve pinched myself.</p>
<p>“What’s the point of freaking out? I’m more excited than anything else, actually. I’m in another world, one with magic. There’s no magic where I come from.”</p>
<p>“But you told me you have so many strange things. Like these ‘cars’ and ‘malls’. It sounds amazing.”</p>
<p>“I’m surprised you believe me, to be honest. If I heard someone talking about my world, I’d assume they were crazy.”</p>
<p>“But you make it sound <em>real.</em> And that stick you have which folds up—”</p>
<p>Another miraculous invention by her standards. I think it was actually that which convinced Durene I was from another world. That, and my iPhone. I think Siri scared Durene more than anything else.</p>
<p>Yes, it turns out I have no wireless, and without battery I turned Siri off to save energy. But having an iPhone, even one with limited power, is amazingly useful in a survival situation, which is what I find myself in.</p>
<p>So is having a friend. I smile at Durene.</p>
<p>“I don’t think my world is that special. But I <em>am</em> glad you found me, Durene. I’ve always found that I can trust most strangers.”</p>
<p>Another pause. Another hypothetical blush.</p>
<p>“Really? But you can’t even see—and you just trusted me to help you. I could be—”</p>
<p>She pauses.</p>
<p>“Someone bad.”</p>
<p>“But you’re not. And I have a good sense for people, or at least, I like to think so. You seem like a very nice person, Durene.”</p>
<p>“I—thank you. But you can’t <em>see—</em>”</p>
<p>I smile wryly.</p>
<p>“I do notice some things. For instance, I know you’re taller than me. And stronger. And you have calluses on your hand, your table is cracked here—and you have a big appetite.”</p>
<p>It’s hard not to notice her chomping down her food, to be honest. Durene shifts in her chair, making the wood creak.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“What? What are you sorry for?”</p>
<p>“Um—”</p>
<p>“I quite enjoyed the eggs and toast. Did you make it yourself?”</p>
<p>This time I think she nods, because there’s a bit of silence before she speaks.</p>
<p>“Oh! Yes! I eat a lot. So I have a big garden and I um, raise chickens and pigs and other animals. But I can’t cook well because I don’t have any Skills.”</p>
<p>“That seems rather harsh. Your food tasted good to me.”</p>
<p>Silence. And then—</p>
<p>“Thank you. But I have to buy a lot of food anyways. The villagers sell me lots of things I can’t make by myself.”</p>
<p>“So you live in a village? How many people live there?”</p>
<p>If it seems odd we didn’t cover that yesterday, well, there’s a lot of explanations and confirming to be done when you think you’ve ended up in another world. Another part is convincing a scared young woman that you haven’t trapped a person in your iPhone.</p>
<p>Is she young? Durene sounds like she’s a bit younger than I am. Of course, I’m terrible at judging ages so she could be anywhere from my age to still in her teens. Girls grow up quicker than guys, after all.</p>
<p>Back to the conversation. Durene apparently lives in a small village of around sixty souls, most of whom live closer to each other. They inhabit a lovely area of farming land fed by a river, hence the name Riverfarm. The people there grow crops and raise animals—they have a blacksmith, and a dedicated person to go and trade for them at a town, that person having the most skill at buying and selling.</p>
<p>The people in this village live together in large families. The children often go out to learn jobs in other towns as they grow, or manage the family business. It’s rare to see a single new face in a month, let alone a group of people aside from adventurers or Runners now and then.</p>
<p>Oh yes, this world has adventurers and the weirdest postal service I can imagine. But what stands out to me in all of Durene’s explanations is an odd…lack of detail. Namely herself.</p>
<p>Durene doesn’t live in the village. From what she says, the only other people who live alone are bachelors or bachelorettes or those who have lost their partners. But Durene is far too young to fit either criteria, and she tells me she’s never met an adventurer, despite them being popular with all the kids.</p>
<p>I smell a rat. And Durene. She still smells…off. If I met other people I might understand what’s different about her, but until then I just keep the conversation going and tell her a bit about where I come from.</p>
<p>That’s me Laken Godart, blind son to two fairly affluent parents, one a lawyer, the other a businessman. I’ve travelled more places than Durene’s heard of, and I’m blind. That’s a basic description, but the key to selling yourself is embellishment.</p>
<p>And all too soon, I find that Durene’s big breakfast has affected me in another way. I clear my throat politely.</p>
<p>“Uh, Durene? Can you help me get to the bathroom again?”</p>
<p>Yes, it’s embarrassing to have to ask someone you’ve just met to help you out, but I’m used to it. Don’t want to walk into the ladies’ room now, do I? But then, they’ve always been quite considerate the two times I’ve done it by accident.</p>
<p>Anyways, it’s always easier if I ask for help, especially since any door could be the wrong one. And Durene is happy to help.</p>
<p>“No problem. This way—oops! Let me just push this aside—the door’s over here.”</p>
<p>She’s very considerate. Normally people have a hard time directing me, but she’s gotten the hang of it quite quickly. She lets me grab onto her arm—I can feel her muscles rippling every time she shifts—and she walks forwards at a reasonably fast pace.</p>
<p>It’s not as if I have trouble moving around, and I can sense whether she’s walking up an incline or stepping around something. It’s natural to me, and once I explained that to Durene she got the trick of it quickly.</p>
<p>Her bathroom is an outhouse located outside of her home and a ways away from the stream. She has to wait at a respectful distance afterwards, but I don’t take long. There’s only one problem.</p>
<p>“Do you have any toilet paper? Uh, anything to wipe with?”</p>
<p>“I’ll get some leaves!”</p>
<p>“Leaves? Hello? Durene?”</p>
<p>It turns out toilet paper is a luxury so rare Durene’s never heard of it before. But the leaves she gives me are serviceable, and my butt doesn’t complain too much.</p>
<p>The outhouse is definitely an outhouse in the sense that I know there’s no water below me as I toss the leaves down. But it smells nice; Durene’s put some fragrant herb there to chase away the smells. I say as much as I leave.</p>
<p>“Your home seems very nice, Durene. I’m envious.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing special. It’s really not. It’s—crude.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. But uh, do you have anywhere I can wash up? And some soap?”</p>
<p>“Soap?”</p>
<p>It takes me a while to get across the basic idea of hygiene to Durene. That’s my first worry. But she boils some hot water for me and when I’m reassured it’s not scalding, I use that.</p>
<p>“You really need to wash your hands, Durene. In my world, countless people died in the past because they didn’t keep themselves clean enough.”</p>
<p>“<em>Really?</em>”</p>
<p>It’s amazing, flattering, and humbling how Durene takes all my statements at face-value. I tell her about the Black Plague, and within minutes she’s swearing up and down to buy some soap the next time someone goes into town.</p>
<p>Before I know it, it’s lunch-time. I could certainly use something to eat, and Durene takes me around the garden, letting me feel the growing plants and the bunch of potatoes she yanks up.</p>
<p>But then we hit a problem. Durene goes into the kitchen to cook them while I sit outside and listen. But after twenty minutes I know something’s wrong. I can hear her trying to be quiet, but the clattering and the burnt smell can’t be so easily hidden.</p>
<p>“Is everything okay? Durene?”</p>
<p>“I—I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>There’s a catch in her voice when she comes out and tells me she’s ruined the potatoes. I don’t get it, but if there was a fire alarm in her house it would be blaring. She doesn’t even let me inspect the ruined food; apparently it’s so burned she just dumped it outside for the pigs.</p>
<p>“I can’t cook potatoes. I’m sorry. I normally eat them raw.”</p>
<p>“Well, we can’t have that. Let me help you.”</p>
<p>“Help? But you—”</p>
<p>“I can’t see, but I <em>can</em> cook. Come on!”</p>
<p>I reach out and touch her arm. It’s a big arm, and she recoils instantly. But I soothe her and guide her back to the kitchen.</p>
<p>It’s an odd thing, cooking while mainly instructing someone else. Odd, but fun. Only for me at first, but then Durene gets into it.</p>
<p>We make sautéed potatoes. It’s an easy recipe, but I have to show Durene how to cut properly at first. I hear her cut herself twice before I realize her form is off.</p>
<p>“Like this, see? If you’re cutting leaves like this rosemary—do it like this.”</p>
<p>Durene gasps, but I place the knife at my knuckles and roll it across the cutting board, slowly slicing the herbs into small slices.</p>
<p>“Easy as anything. Don’t worry; even if you can’t see, there’s no way to cut yourself like this, see?”</p>
<p>“I do! That’s incredible!”</p>
<p>“It’s not. Really. Now, let’s get to work on the rest of those potatoes, okay?”</p>
<p>“Okay. The chopped potatoes are…here. We boil them?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Is the water boiling? And you added the salt? Put them in. They’ll go there for about four minutes, okay? Now. Where’s the pan?”</p>
<p>“I put the oil in.”</p>
<p>“Now the potatoes. Flat side down. There. Doesn’t that sound good?”</p>
<p>The sizzling oil makes my stomach wake up. I smile as I hear Durene clumsily sliding the sliced potatoes around the pan.</p>
<p>“Is it crispy golden brown? Okay, let’s reduce the heat. Now…a bit of butter. Just a bit…and the rosemary…doesn’t that smell delicious?”</p>
<p>“It does! It does!”</p>
<p>Success. We sit down and Durene eats her food as if it’s the best food she’s ever had. Apparently, it is.</p>
<p>“I’ve never cooked anything like that before. Do you have a Skill? You must!”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t call it skill. I just learned from a great chef.”</p>
<p>Thank you Gordon Ramsay. I might not be able to see them cook, but I do love chefs who tell me exactly what they’re doing.</p>
<p>“Are you a [Chef]? Is that your class?”</p>
<p>That’s an odd way of putting things. I shrug, a bit embarrassed.</p>
<p>“I wanted to be a professional chef, and then a professional food critic when I was younger. I gave up on that when I found out someone else had already become blind Masterchef. And, it has to be said, I’m not that good at cooking.”</p>
<p>“But this—”</p>
<p>“It’s not nearly as good as something professional chefs can make, believe me. And you did all the hard work.”</p>
<p>“You know so much, though.”</p>
<p>I want to squirm a bit with embarrassment.</p>
<p>“I just studied a lot of different professions, that’s all. Chef, food critic…at one point I wanted to be a billiards player, but that’s not actually possible. I wanted to do anything that wasn’t boring, so I tried a lot of things.”</p>
<p>“That’s so amazing. So much better than I am.”</p>
<p>I think she’s staring at me. I can feel her proximity towards me. Her voice is also much more intent—she sounds fascinated. I can’t help but smile.</p>
<p>“You’d be surprised what you can pick up if you work at it. Forget cooking—I once disassembled and reassembled an old computer by hand. That’s…like a complicated device.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t know. I…I only have the [Farmer] class.”</p>
<p>There it is again. Class? I frown.</p>
<p>“Classes? Do you mean jobs? You mean, you get assigned a job?”</p>
<p>“No. I’m just a [Farmer]. Level 6. Do you not have classes in your world?”</p>
<p>“Oh wow.”</p>
<p>Is it obvious? Did I not notice it because I can’t see? But Durene assures me she doesn’t have her class and level floating above her head like an MMORPG. Even so, my mind is blown because now I realize I’m in a video game. Or something like a video game.</p>
<p>“You mean, you played games with the fates of people?”</p>
<p>“No! It was all just pretend. But it’s exactly like how you’re describing your world.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>We sit together, in her garden, talking. By this point Durene and I are comfortable enough to sit closer than before, and yes, she is tall. I’m not short myself; apparently I’m around 184 cm, or around 6’1’’ for people using the horrible US measuring system, but Durene is at least a head higher than I am. Possibly bigger; she hunches over as we talk.</p>
<p>And she is huge. And conscious of that; she treats me even more like a glass object than people who just know I’m blind. I am grateful in her case, though; it does feel a bit like a giant is keeping me company.</p>
<p>Hmm. A giant?</p>
<p>One last detail: Durene’s skin is rougher than normal. Her inside palm is fairly smooth, if callused, but the few times I brushed against the outside of her skin, it was surprisingly rough and even felt cracked in places.</p>
<p>Odd. But she is a great listener, and we sit together long into the night. I tell her stories, and she tells me of this world. Magic and adventurers and a gaming system.</p>
<p>Dinner that night is marinated mushrooms, again thanks to me marathon watching Ramsay videos. It’s good that I remember so many vegetarian dishes; Durene likes meat, but it is apparently a rare delicacy for her, despite the pigs she introduced me to earlier today.</p>
<p>We don’t have any vinegar, but Durene’s garden is plentiful, and everything is so high quality that we barely need any seasoning to make it go down. Fresh water from the stream completes the meal, and Durene eats four times what I do. Good thing we made a lot.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish I could see. I have no idea what it would be like, and usually I don’t ever care. But when I’m having a bad day or I’m frustrated and wish things were easier, I wish I could see.</p>
<p>But now, I just want to see her face. Even though it seems like Durene is self-conscious about it.</p>
<p>I wonder why. I wonder as I tuck myself into her bed and listen to her snoring outside.</p>
<p>At least I know she’s not a Troll. The ones from the Hobbit turn into stone in the morning, don’t they? Maybe people just grow really big in this world.</p>
<p>Maybe. But she’s still a good person, regardless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 3</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently, one of Durene’s obsessions is fish. Understandably so; she can’t catch much game and she sells most of her pigs rather than eat them. Her occasional chicken only comes when one dies, and as I’ve observed, she has trouble cooking even the most basic of meals.</p>
<p>But fish? Fish is hard to get wrong, and Durene has a crude fishing rod that she tries to catch fish at the stream with almost every day. Apparently, she has little success and I figure out why quite soon.</p>
<p>“You need some bait that wriggles. Worms are better. And you’re moving the line too much. Let the fish bite before you pull it out of the water. See? Patience is key.”</p>
<p>It’s amazing. But no one’s ever taught Durene this, and she observes me fishing with rapt attention. I feel—</p>
<p>I feel happy to teach her, and supremely annoyed no one ever taught her something as simple as this. Do people in her village not know how to fish?</p>
<p>Or is there another reason why she lives alone?</p>
<p>I get half my answer after I yank the second small fish out of the stream, much to Durene’s delight. I hear voices, laughter; the sounds of several children. And then I hear the voices.</p>
<p>“Freak! Come out, Freak!”</p>
<p>Beside me, on the grass, Durene goes still. I pause, the crude clay mug Durene gave me half full as I scoop water out of the stream.</p>
<p>“Where is she? Freak!”</p>
<p>I hear merry laughter, running, shouts of joy at odds with the words and tone in the childrens’ voices. It doesn’t take them long to find us.</p>
<p>“Freak! Freaky freak! Fr—who’s <em>that?</em>”</p>
<p>I turn my head as the sounds of running feet stop. I counted…six kids? All young; probably around ten. Mostly boys, although there’s one girl in there. They pause uncertainly.</p>
<p>“This is Laken. He’s a stranger to these parts.”</p>
<p>Durene tries to explain. I smile and introduce myself, but the instant the children discover I’m blind, respectfulness vanishes.</p>
<p>“He’s blind!”</p>
<p>“A freak! Freak’s gotta friend!”</p>
<p>“Freaks!”</p>
<p>Is there something in the water here? Or is it just them? I frown at the kids.</p>
<p>“That’s not a word you should be using about Durene.”</p>
<p>“But she’s a <em>freak</em>!”</p>
<p>One of the boys protests. Then I hear a yelp and the girl speaks.</p>
<p>“I think he don’t know. He can’t see her!”</p>
<p>“That’s right!”</p>
<p>More exclamations.</p>
<p>“You should run, Mister! Durene’ll eat your heart out!”</p>
<p>“No I won’t!”</p>
<p>“Aah! Run from the freak! She’s gone mad!”</p>
<p>Durene stands up in anguish. And then I hear her yelp. Someone’s tossed a stone at her! I hear it plop into the stream.</p>
<p>“Eat dirt, Freak!”</p>
<p>Okay, mudballs. Another one flies. Durene’s not doing anything to defend herself, so I stand up. The mug of water is still in my hands. For a second I’m tempted to hurl it but—that wouldn’t be right. The children go silent. What should I say?</p>
<p>“It’s nice to meet all of you. Cheers, mates.”</p>
<p>I raise the mug of water in their general direction and then drink from it. Honestly, it tastes a bit like clay. I look at the kids, or rather, in their general direction I hope.</p>
<p>“Now piss off.”</p>
<p>Silence. I keep my face still. I’ve never actually stared anyone in the eye mainly because I could miss, and I can barely keep my eyes open for a staring contest in any case. My eyes still get watery even if I can’t see.</p>
<p>But I am good at holding still and remaining calm. The children aren’t. After a few more seconds I hear them retreat.</p>
<p>I sit back down next to Durene. She’s trembling.</p>
<p>“You okay?”</p>
<p>I keep my tone light as I reach for the fishing pole again. I can’t find it, but then Durene silently presses it into my hands.</p>
<p>“Do you know what I meant when I said ‘cheers’? It’s an expression from another culture. It means, well, it’s something you say before you have a drink, or at a party.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Her voice is quivery, but it is curious. I nod and smile.</p>
<p>“I met an Australian guy once who could make that word sound like a threat. He said it to a bunch of soldiers who were bothering us and—well, it’s not always polite. It’s all about nuance, you see?”</p>
<p>More silence. I hear Durene gulp.</p>
<p>“I—I’m sorry. What they said—”</p>
<p>“—Is none of my concern. Those little wankers were being obnoxious anyways. They’re too good to be called brats. Do they harass you often?”</p>
<p>It’s nice to know more than one culture. It helps when you want to add to your repertoire of insults. Durene laughs shakily, then goes quiet again.</p>
<p>“Sometimes. I mean, they come by sometimes but they don’t do more than throw things.”</p>
<p>“Like rocks?”</p>
<p>Silence is my answer. I clear my throat.</p>
<p>“They’re miserable little monsters; don’t listen to them. Anyways, they’re just kids, aren’t they? Can’t you chase them off?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t do that! I might hurt someone, and then—”</p>
<p>She sounds genuinely shocked. And afraid. Is she worried about the mob of stereotypical farmers with pitchforks? But that had to come from somewhere. Maybe she’s right to be passive.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry if I got you in trouble. But I couldn’t stand by and let them harass you.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I think. Yes, it’s okay. But I’m surprised you weren’t angrier when they called you a freak. <em>You’re</em> not.”</p>
<p>Again, her tone suggests…what? Depression? Low self-esteem, certainly. But the clues aren’t all there yet, even if I know most of what’s going on. As for me…I shrug.</p>
<p>“I used to be a lot angrier than this. But I’ve gotten calmer now; I don’t lose my temper that much. I’ve been called names too.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>I smile again, but this time with an edge.</p>
<p>“Everyone gets called names. I’m just an easier target since I can’t see anything coming. Then again, I get it. When you’re a kid, anything weird is a target. Anything different or scary…it’s easier to shout insults than get to know the person. That doesn’t mean I think what those brats did was right, of course. Next time one of them calls you names, hit him. Or just call him names as well.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t hit anyone! And I’m not good with insults.”</p>
<p>“What? Insults are easy. Come on, try one. Call me something.”</p>
<p>“I—I don’t know. What would I even call them?”</p>
<p>“Unexploded pimple? Pitiful asshat? Cowardly mushroom? Insults can be anything you want them to be.”</p>
<p>The laugh that comes out of Durene is more like a bark of amusement, but it’s genuine and real.</p>
<p>“Tell you what. Let’s grill up these fish and I can teach you some of the really pithy insults I’ve heard of, okay? You might want to cover your ears though; some of them could make a sailor blush.”</p>
<p>She laughs delightedly and I smile again. It’s a better day, despite the kids. And the fish isn’t even burnt this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 5</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I find myself spending almost all my time with Durene day by day. She’s an open person and easy to talk to; she likes listening more than she likes speaking, but she can break down this strange world into easy-to-understand fragments for me.</p>
<p>She’s in the middle of giving me a history lesson about some version of Alexander the Great when I hear a shout. I’m ready for the kids this time, but to my surprise, only one comes running.</p>
<p>“Durene! The wagon’s lost a wheel! Come and lift it, our Da says!”</p>
<p>“What? The wagon? I’m on my way!”</p>
<p>Durene jumps to her feet with amazing agility, and then hesitates.</p>
<p>“I have to go help, Laken. Will you be okay? I can take you there—”</p>
<p>“I’m fine. Go. I’ll be okay until you come back.”</p>
<p>Again, being blind is not like being porcelain. I let Durene run off with the kid and think of what to do. Twenty minutes later, Durene thunders back to the cottage looking for me.</p>
<p>I’m fishing.</p>
<p>“Durene. You’re back. Is everything okay?”</p>
<p>She smells a bit of hay and some other animal scent. And a bit more of that musky odor that’s probably her sweat. I hear her clear the stream in one jump.</p>
<p>“Everything’s fine. I helped Mister Prost with his wagon; that’s all. The axle of the wheel broke, so he had Finnon go get me.”</p>
<p>“Huh. Do they always call on you for help? It seems like they’d need a team of people to move a busted wagon.”</p>
<p>She shifts next to me. Uncomfortably? It’s surprisingly easy to tell when someone’s hiding something even if you can’t read their face.</p>
<p>“Oh—it wasn’t that hard. I just had to help lift it up a bit, that’s all.”</p>
<p>She doesn’t even sound winded. But she ran off and came back in less than ten minutes and helped a farmer put a new wheel on a wagon?</p>
<p>Odd. Odd, odd, odd, odd…</p>
<p>“You do repairs often, then? That’s pretty handy of you.”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t have a class. But if they need help lifting or, you know, raising a barn—”</p>
<p>“Gotcha. So how bad is the damage?”</p>
<p>“They’ll have to fix it later, but it looks like it was just the axle that went. I just got the wagon back to their home so they could give old Evera a rest. She’s their plow horse and she gets tired quickly.”</p>
<p>Okay, so she <em>pulled</em> a wagon which might or might not have been full of produce an unspecified distance. Hmm.</p>
<p>It could just be her class. Durene said she was a Level 6 [Farmer], but she has one [Enhanced Strength] skill already. Apparently that makes her way stronger than normal; when I asked her to demonstrate, she lifted me up with one hand as if I was a feather.</p>
<p>But the skin? And the things those kids said? What could that—</p>
<p>Bah. What am I, a detective? The answer is no, because I can barely solve a Sherlock Holmes mystery, let alone figure out those stupid wire puzzles. And Durene deserves respect from me, if no one else.</p>
<p>She’ll tell me when she’s ready.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 6</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>“I need a class.”</p>
<p>That was what I told Durene when she woke up in the morning. I get up before she does; not that either of us are late sleepers. We’re both morning people actually, although I tend to function just as well in the dark as in the light for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>But I do like to hear the birds sing and feel the sunlight on my face. I don’t mind relaxing for an hour or two by myself in the mornings. As Zoe once told me, I’m the chillest blind guy she knows, which is to say I’m the only blind guy she knows. She knows a blind girl—Teresa, but she and I don’t get along.</p>
<p>I hate Teresa.</p>
<p>Durene is silent for a long moment after I tell her this. We made doughy crepes this morning and added some wild berries, but she stops eating them now.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it what people do in this world? You told me no one you know didn’t have a class.”</p>
<p>“That’s true. But…”</p>
<p>I wait, yet no further thought comes. I explain myself while I try to see what’s making her upset.</p>
<p>“I’ve put a lot of thought into it, and I need to have a class to survive in this world. I can’t just rely on your goodwill forever.”</p>
<p>“But a class—that means you’d go and get a job, right? You’d…leave.”</p>
<p>Oh. <em>Oh.</em> I feel like an idiot.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be a burden, Durene. I’m already making you sleep outside and now you have to feed two mouths.”</p>
<p>“That’s not a problem!”</p>
<p>The table shifts as Durene moves. She apologizes, and then her tone changes, becomes more pleading.</p>
<p>“I don’t mind the grass! I don’t! And you eat a lot less than I do. I wouldn’t mind you staying! I…like having you around.”</p>
<p>What do I say? What do I do? Whatever it is, it must be something that won’t break her tender heart.</p>
<p>“You know I have a home, Durene, and a family. They’re probably worried sick about me. I want to get back to them.”</p>
<p>I can almost feel her drooping at the other side of the table. I clear my throat and go on.</p>
<p>“<em>But</em> I do enjoy staying here with you. If you’re sure I won’t be a burden, I’d love to stay here. I just mentioned a class because it’s fascinating, really.”</p>
<p>“You’ll stay here? You’re sure?”</p>
<p>It’s not pathetic how eager she sounds, how hopeful. It’s heartbreaking. Who left this girl alone? I nod.</p>
<p>“I doubt there are many jobs for a blind person in your world anyways. Unless I can learn magic? I’d love to learn that.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I’ve heard of spellbooks, but I don’t know if mages learn any other way.”</p>
<p>I make a face, mildly outraged as I eat more crepe. Even in this world I’m handicapped by a lack of braille books? And I very much doubt there’s any kind of audio spellbook.</p>
<p>“Well, that idea’s out. I guess I’ll have to sleep on it.”</p>
<p>Then I have another idea. I suggest it to Durene as I help her wash the pottery dishes. She doesn’t use soap, but hot water works pretty well. She can tolerate the heat far better than I, though. But her hands are clumsier, so we both work slow.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you show me around your village?”</p>
<p>Durene nearly drops the cup she’s holding. I push it back into the bucket of water just in time; the splash gets water all over my clothes.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? I haven’t introduced myself, and I’m sure they’re curious about me.”</p>
<p>“I—I wouldn’t want to bother you.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I like meeting people. Besides, I have to meet them sooner or later, don’t I?”</p>
<p>“I guess.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 8</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It takes me two more days for me to convince Durene to take me into the village. She resists, stonewalls—not so much out of reluctance to visit on her behalf, but for fear of how the villagers will treat me, I think.</p>
<p>And how do the villagers treat me?</p>
<p>With kindness.</p>
<p>Oh, they knew a stranger had moved into Durene’s house, but no one had come by. I think they were more apprehensive than curious, and Durene herself might have told them to steer clear before then. It isn’t as if we are always together; she made several trips into the village prior to my arrival, and I can only speculate I was the topic of gossip.</p>
<p>When Durene finally lets me into the village, I hear a few mutters, but Prost, the [Farmer] who Durene had helped out a few days ago, is the first to shake my hand.</p>
<p>“You’ve got a fine grip, son. You’d be a good farmer.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but I’d keep trying to milk the bull, and that wouldn’t end up well for anyone, would it?”</p>
<p>A joke, a laugh, and I change from the scary unknown to someone approachable, even likeable. One mother smacks her son for calling me names, and soon I’m introducing myself as a traveler from far off, sidetracked by a spell and relying on Durene for help.</p>
<p>That bit of fiction is met by approval from all the villagers, but later on Prost takes me aside as Durene helps lift a few kegs for one of the farmers.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say much about Durene—she’s a good helper in times of need, but she’s a bit—”</p>
<p>“She seems like a nice, normal young woman to me. Wouldn’t you agree?”</p>
<p>I shut him down in an instant. I don’t want to know. Not from him. Not from someone who isn’t Durene who’s chosen to tell me. That ends the conversation; it’s awkward for a few moments until I ask about farming around here. Turns out that these farmers have quite the variety of crops, and they’re fascinated when I talk about greenhouses and crop rotation. Some high-level [Farmers] have Skills that approximate those effects, and soon I’m actually giving out vague advice on farming techniques I half-remember. Too bad I can’t give them a combine harvester.</p>
<p>Durene hovers around me anxiously at first, but then relaxes as time went by. The other villagers treat her—well, I guess. They have a huge mug of milk for her, and she helps drag a huge tree that had fallen out of the way. But—</p>
<p>We leave the village after several hours, with invitations for me to call on various families for a meal and conversation. I can tell stories about the places I’ve been to if I omit the parts that they wouldn’t understand, and in this small village I’m the equivalent of a celebrity, or a novelty.</p>
<p>The villagers like me. I think I can say that with confidence. They think I’m kind, charming, and okay, mad as a loon. But Farmer Prost’s wife Yesel gives me a basket full of goods to take back to Durene’s home—or rather, she gives Durene that, and I met a good deal of people that day. All in all it was a success.</p>
<p>I just wonder why they dislike Durene so. Or maybe not dislike? She’s clearly known them all her life. But there’s a wall between her and them, and no matter how kindly the villager are towards her and no matter how hard she tries to be as helpful and meek as possible, they still keep their distance from her. I hear it in their tones and observe it through their actions.</p>
<p>It makes me hate them, just a little.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 11</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I woke up knowing what class I’d have. I was so antsy that over breakfast I nearly put my hand on the frying pan in distraction. I broke the news to Durene as we ate cheese on scrambled eggs; neither of us could do omelettes.</p>
<p>“I think I’ll become an [Emperor]. Do you know if I have to declare that? Or is it just doing something that gives you the class?”</p>
<p>Durene choked on her eggs and I had to listen to her splutter for a while before any coherent words came out.</p>
<p>“That’s impossible! Laken! What are you saying?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to be an [Emperor]. It seems like the easiest class for me to take, and perhaps I’ll gain some useful skills.”</p>
<p>Honestly, it was the first class that came into my mind as a viable option. But Durene told me flat out it was impossible. I told her she was wrong.</p>
<p>“You <em>can</em> be an [Emperor], Durene. You can, and I can.”</p>
<p>“It’s not possible! To do that—you’d need a kingdom, and a palace and white horse and—and—”</p>
<p>Her voice trails off, unable to even describe my folly. I can only smile.</p>
<p>“But you <em>can,</em> Durene. I know of a man, an ordinary man, who became an Emperor. All by himself, although he was poor and he had no palace or horse.”</p>
<p>“Really? Who?”</p>
<p>There’s skepticism, but curiosity and eagerness in her voice in equal measure. She always loves stories from my world. This one puts a grin on my face even as I speak.</p>
<p>“He was known as Emperor Norton the 1<sup>st</sup> of America. He was a real man who became an Emperor just by calling himself one. I always loved his story.”</p>
<p>“Emperor? But you said America has no rulers. Only someone with the [President] class.”</p>
<p>My explanations of how my world works might have gotten a bit jumbled. I shake my head.</p>
<p>“That’s true. But Norton didn’t care what the rules were. One day, he declared himself Emperor. And he lived and died acting as one.”</p>
<p>It’s an amazing story, and one I have to struggle to do justice to. How can I explain to Durene the tale of Joshua Norton, a failed businessman who one day woke up and sent letters to every newspaper in San Francisco proclaiming himself as the Emperor of the United States?</p>
<p>Well, sort of like that, actually.</p>
<p>“He made proclamations and sent orders to the army—none of which were ever obeyed—and he even made his own money. I know it sounds ridiculous, Durene, and I’ll just bet you’re smiling, but here’s the crazy thing: it worked! The people let him go around calling himself Emperor, and in time they began treating him like one.”</p>
<p>“They didn’t.”</p>
<p>“They did. Not all of course, but he eventually made his own money and became known throughout the city. The people of San Francisco accepted his currency, and he dined in the finest restaurants and went to famous plays in the theater where they would hold a seat for him. When he died, over thirty thousand people went to his funeral.”</p>
<p>Durene listens in silence, rapt with attention. I can only imagine it myself. His story captured my heart.</p>
<p>“Some say he was a madman. And maybe he was; he probably was, honestly. But he also dared to dream. And that’s something I’ve always admired about him.”</p>
<p>He dared to dream. There are worse things to be remembered by. And unlike the rich businessmen and famous stars and politicians of the day, Norton I is still marked in history as the first and only Emperor of the United States. It may seem funny to most people, but I think he’s the one laughing in the end.</p>
<p>“If one man can declare himself Emperor, I don’t see why I can’t follow suit. Kings might be born to rule, but the first kings were just men with an army who made themselves crowns. I might not have an army, or a crown, but it’s worth a shot.”</p>
<p>“Maybe.”</p>
<p>As impressed as she is by the story, I can hear the doubt oozing from Durene’s every word. But I just grin.</p>
<p>“I’m in another world, Durene, and from what you’ve said, classes rule this place. Why not take one of the best ones if I can? So. You can be my witness.”</p>
<p>I stand up dramatically, praying I don’t hit anything by accident as I gesture grandly.</p>
<p>“Hear my words, that they may be passed down for posterity. On this day, I, Laken Godart, declare myself Emperor of the Unseen, sovereign lord and ruler of all I survey. Not only Emperor; I declare myself Protector of Durene’s House as well.”</p>
<p>For a second I hold the pose, and then hear Durene giggle. It sounds amazing coming from her deep voice. I smile and sit back down.</p>
<p>“You can’t <em>do</em> that! What if someone heard you?”</p>
<p>“Well, then I’d demand that they show me the proper respect I deserve. And ask for their taxes. You owe me a tithe, I believe. I demand your finest crepe as your [Emperor].”</p>
<p>Giggling like a girl, Durene passes me one. I eat it with an air of triumph, and tell her several more jokes that make her laugh.</p>
<p>And that’s good. That alone is worth the crazy attempt. But as I sleep that night, I can’t help but think that it would be nice if I could be [Emperor]. I’d make the world a better place, or at least, try to.</p>
<p>I’d like to hear Durene laugh a lot more, and make it so she never has to cry herself to sleep another night.</p>
<p>In my heart, as I let sleep overtake me, I <em>do </em>believe I could do it. I believe. That’s what I learned to do. I believe I can be something more than people expect of me.</p>
<p>My eyes close. I breathe out. And then I hear a voice in my mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Emperor Class Obtained!]</p>
<p>[Emperor Level 1!]</p>
<p>[Skill – Aura of the Emperor obtained!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“Das war ja einfach!”</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 12</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Durene is in a state of panic; I’m calm.</p>
<p>Sort of calm. I’m freaking out, but in a good way. Durene’s just freaking out.</p>
<p>I blink as she tromps past me, nearly hitting my leg. Her voice is strained as talks out loud.</p>
<p>“It can’t be! You don’t have any fancy clothes! How can you be an—an—<em>[Emperor]</em>? It doesn’t make sense!”</p>
<p>I don’t know. But I do know, at the same time. I sit up straight. I can’t tell how this new Skill I’ve received works, but I feel a bit…different. A bit more secure in myself. I was right. I dreamed, and I was right.</p>
<p>“Durene. Is an [Emperor] simply defined by his clothes? A king is still a king in rags, after all. It may sound silly, but in this world people become what they believe, I think. You haven’t become a [Cook] because you don’t think you can be one. But I? I think I can do anything I want to. And I think you can too.”</p>
<p>She stops mid-step. I can sense her facing me.</p>
<p>“I—I have to go. I have to—go.”</p>
<p>She practically knocks the door down trying to get away. I sit and think in her house, trying to figure out what it means. Something. What can an [Emperor] do? What could my skills do? Is it even practical? How can I get home?</p>
<p>Someday, I want to go home. Even if Durene is here, I…</p>
<p>I need to find my family again.</p>
<p>When the door opens again, Durene comes in silent, but no longer panicking. She avoids the topic of my class and I do too, at least for a bit.</p>
<p>“You have a nice home, Durene. But I’d love to visit a town someday, or a city.”</p>
<p>She hesitates.</p>
<p>“I—I want to, too. But it’s tricky…”</p>
<p>I don’t ask why. Instead I just nod.</p>
<p>“You’ve said there are other continents in this world, filled with all kinds of different species.”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>“Where are we? What continent are we on?”</p>
<p>“Izril. We’re on Izril.”</p>
<p>“Huh. Sounds almost familiar.”</p>

		<p><strong>Day 13</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am an [Emperor]. That is fact.</p>
<p>But I don’t know what it means. After an entire day of speculation and worry, Durene has no more answers for me. Myself, I’m just content to find out.</p>
<p>I guess it’s because of my class that Durene is freaking out so much. To me, it’s just a title that doesn’t mean much; something that happened to me because I tried something new. But to Durene, that class automatically makes me royalty.</p>
<p>No—isn’t an [Emperor] even higher in status than a [King]? A king might rule by virtue of lineage, but an emperor could in theory rule over multiple countries, and thus kings.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I guess it’s a huge deal, but again, I’m only Level 1, and all I have is one odd skill. When I told Durene, she said she couldn’t see anything like an aura about me, but Skills don’t work all the time necessarily. Some, like her [Enhanced Strength] skill are essentially permanent passive changes, but others have to be used.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, there’s no word or catchphrase that activates [Aura of the Emperor]. Believe me, I tried and probably looked quite silly doing so. Whatever it is the skill, like my class, is a mystery that will have to wait.</p>
<p>I sigh as I carefully walk across the dirt forest path near Durene’s house. It’s been a while since I’ve been by myself, and to be honest, I needed this break. My lovely host has been fussing over me all day, and she didn’t even want to let me go out on my own.</p>
<p>That was an argument she was never going to win. Her concern is touching, but I’m hardly a quadriplegic; I need to stretch my legs and I hate being chaperoned all of the time. It’s fairly easy to keep track of the dirt path, and I’m hardly about to wander off that far. Durene showed me the route, and I have it memorized.</p>
<p>“What a mess.”</p>
<p>It really is. I’ve gotten used to living in this world thanks to Durene, but now a bunch of questions are circling around in my head. How can I get back home? Is it even possible?</p>
<p>Durene is convinced that whatever happened to me was the result of magic. I tend to agree, but if any normal spell could teleport me across worlds, I’ll eat my hat. No, something big happened that dragged me here, and I need to find out what.</p>
<p>And I won’t be able to do that in Riverfarm. I need to go out into the world. A lone, blind guy in a world full of monsters and magic.</p>
<p>That would be my death. But it’s different for an [Emperor], isn’t it? What’s the difference between a blind man and a blind [Emperor]?</p>
<p>Maybe everything. Because one of them is an [Emperor].</p>
<p>Norton I of America. Do you know why I loved his story? Because he was the Emperor of the United States in his head, and nothing could take that away from him.</p>
<p>Being blind sometimes sucks. For me it’s normal, but there are days when I grow frustrated. Frustrated because other people can do things so effortlessly that I struggle to do. I’ll never catch a ball, or drive, or even paint. I can’t experience some of the things people talk about.</p>
<p>It’s a bit unfair. And when I was young, I hated the way I was treated. Sometimes, yes, sometimes, I felt like less of a person because people thought of me that way. Here’s a blind kid. <em>He</em> can’t appreciate this, or do that. He’s different. Not the same.</p>
<p>But I am blind. I have my own worth, regardless of whether people acknowledge that.</p>
<p>I stop walking. Here I am, in a forest I can’t see. In a world totally different from my own. Some might say that it’s not that different for someone who can’t see, but I can sense the difference in every step I take. I feel the same wonder when I hear a new bird’s call, or touch Durene’s hands and know that <em>she</em> is different.</p>
<p>I am an [Emperor]. No one can take that from me. I may have gotten that class easily—just by declaring myself so. But I believed in it, even so. I believed. When you are blind, sometimes the world is uncertain. I have to trust when I get up and walk around my house that everything is the way I left it.</p>
<p>I trust the things I touch with my cane, just like a seeing person trusts their eyes. But I am prepared for the times when I miss a branch or something with my cane and walk right into a shrub. I am ready, in short, to walk off a cliff some days because I can’t ever be 100% certain something is right in front of me. But I have to believe I’ll step onto solid ground.</p>
<p>So believe this: I am an [Emperor]. I should start acting like one rather than worrying about what it means.</p>
<p>What should I do, then? What would an [Emperor] do? I think for a while as I continue my slow amble through the forest.</p>
<p>“I am an [Emperor]. Ergo, everything I want to do is what an [Emperor] would do. There are no wrong choices.”</p>
<p>But are there even more <em>right</em> ones? I remember studying Charlemagne’s history. The man was an imperialist; as far as I can recall he was more or less personally involved in wars of conquest. And yet, he also instituted huge reforms across his empire.</p>
<p>So did Norton, at least in theory. He wanted to abolish Congress to safeguard his empire, and rumors have it that he actually stood in front of a mob to protect Chinese immigrants during race riots. Regardless of whether that’s historically true or not, an [Emperor] has a duty to his empire and those he rules over. He keeps them safe, protects them; makes them better.</p>
<p>I would like to do the same for Durene. If she is my one subject, then what can I do for her? I walk and think, and only stop when I notice Durene not-so-subtly trying to shadow me in the forest. She really can’t hide at all. But she does care, which is why I like her.</p>
<p>I do like her a lot. I just wish she’d tell me everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 14</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What would any good [Emperor] do? What would any sensible person do when finding themselves in another world, much less a game world? Today I asked Durene countless questions about Riverfarm and the world. I’d asked her a lot before, but today I compiled it all together in my head.</p>
<p>“So you’ve never really gone further than a few miles outside of the village?”</p>
<p>“No. Never.”</p>
<p>Durene and I sit together, sipping from some home-brewed mint tea. It’s quite strong since we’re using actual mint steeped in hot water. It’s a shame we can’t add some honey or sugar, but Durene has neither.</p>
<p>She’s not rich. That much is clear, although I have to dance around the topic a bit.</p>
<p>“So you earn a few coins from selling your crops and animals now and then. But you’ve never gone with the trading cart to town?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>She shifts in her seat and slurps from her tea. She’s uncomfortable. I sigh.</p>
<p>“You know, Durene. I don’t really care if you’re a bit different from other people. You’re a nice young woman; regardless of who you are, I won’t judge you.”</p>
<p>Silence. Then, her deep voice quavers.</p>
<p>“Do you—? Did someone—?”</p>
<p>“No. But I am smart enough to know you’re hiding something. But I won’t ask until you’re ready. I do hope you know you can trust me, though.”</p>
<p>“I do. I <em>do!</em> It’s just—”</p>
<p>It sounds like she’s on the verge of tears. I reach out and touch her mug instead of her fingers. Durene laughs as I make a face and find her huge hand.</p>
<p>“Take your time. I’m not going anywhere. Now, tell me. What’s it like living here? Do you ever see any monsters?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>Monsters. I can’t even imagine what one of them would be like. According to Durene, they’re not that bad around here. Goblins are the only real nuisance, and the village immediately sends for adventurers to root them out if they’re spotted nearby.</p>
<p>But—yeah, there is a huge difference in the amount of danger people in this world have to live with. I might worry about bears in parts of the world, or muggers, or war, but never horrible little green creatures with teeth like knives.</p>
<p>God, they sound creepy.</p>
<p>“It’s bad when Goblins come. Everyone has to give money to raise a bounty on them, but it always takes the adventurers a few weeks to arrive, and I don’t know what we’d do if a Goblin Chieftain ever showed up.”</p>
<p>Goblins are apparently a bigger threat in the north part of Izril than they are the south. It’s about population density, or so I’m guessing. Humans occupy more of the north than the south which belongs to Drakes and Gnolls and something called the Antinium. So monsters accordingly spring up more near the north since there’s more to eat. Odd; I would have expected them to be more plentiful in places where Humans are less common, but then, these monsters aren’t prey, but our predators.</p>
<p>Riverfarm isn’t that far north—it’s decently far away from the High Passes—a huge mountain range similar to the Himalayas which divide the continent in two. Apparently the nearest major city is Invrisil; the city of adventurers, so named because they have the largest population of adventurers active and retired on the continent.</p>
<p>“They’ve got Gold-rank teams there. You can even find Named Adventurers passing through sometimes! And they say the markets are filled with magical items and wondrous things, like the parts of dead monsters and rare gems and artifacts.”</p>
<p>Durene’s voice is filled with wonder as she describes the city. I have to confess, the image sways me as well. Of course, the adventurers that Riverfarm can afford are a far cry from those elites.</p>
<p>All of the villagers, including Durene, are frankly poor. Durene is especially poor, but the villagers aren’t exactly rolling in wealth either. They earn a few gold coins every year when the weather is good and the crops are plentiful. At best. During the worst times they’re subsistence farmers, or they’re starving.</p>
<p>“Folks save their coins. Mister Prost saves all his coins for instance; he only spends money when he has to buy new tools or fix his wagon. He’s going to have to buy a new plow horse soon; I help out, but Evera—the horse—is old. And they want to start raising pigs, but that’s an investment, and they could always use more coin to fix up the house…”</p>
<p>“Is anyone rich in your village? The [Blacksmith]?”</p>
<p>“Not really. He doesn’t have <em>that</em> many levels and you know, he’s still a [Farmer] as well. There’s another [Blacksmith] in town that has more levels. Occasionally some people from other villages come by with work, but never for more than a few silver coins at best.”</p>
<p>“It sounds like your village does fairly well for itself.”</p>
<p>“Some years. Last year was okay, but the year before that was hungry. If we have a bad harvest or if winter comes early, it’s very hard. The villagers do their best, but sometimes bad things happen. And ever since they took me in—”</p>
<p>She breaks off. I think I understand this bit. Durene is huge. She’s not necessarily fat; she doesn’t let me touch her, but I know that she can move about with surprising speed, faster than I can. So she’s probably not fat, but she is big. She eats roughly four times what I do every meal, at least.</p>
<p>“I try to help out a lot. But I can only pull and lift stuff. I don’t have any Skills.”</p>
<p>“You said you were a Level 6 [Farmer], didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m not too low-level for my age—some people are around Level 15, but I didn’t even apprentice and I taught myself so I leveled up slower.”</p>
<p>“What about your father? Your mother? What did they do when you were growing up?”</p>
<p>Durene hesitates. I wait in silence, the empty cup of mint tea in my hands, shedding the last vestiges of warmth. Then her voice mumbles.</p>
<p>“Mom died when I was four. I never met my dad. He’s dead too.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 16</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think Durene is still depressed after our last conversation. We don’t talk much—that is to say, not about important things. I spend most of the time helping Durene finish up her harvesting. Most of her plants are fully grown, and we pull up several pumpkins today.</p>
<p>She wants to get ready for the winter, although it feels perfectly fine to me right now. Then again, I don’t know this world so weather could change a lot quicker around here.</p>
<p>I also sense that Durene is wrestling with something in her head, most likely whether to tell me about her past. It feels like it’s on the tip of her tongue sometimes when she pauses in talking with me.</p>
<p>But not yet. I abide. I’ve learned patience, and in the meantime I can teach Durene some things.</p>
<p>“So, your heart sends blood across the rest of your body. From your head to your toes. So you could lose an arm or a leg if you made sure to stop the blood loss, but your heart is essential.”</p>
<p>Durene scratches at her head.</p>
<p>“But doesn’t the heart get tired? I get tired from walking all day. How can a heart keep beating all the time?”</p>
<p>I grin.</p>
<p>“It’s the strongest muscle in our bodies. And it <em>does</em> get tired. People have heart attacks—times where the heart stops—as they get older. There’s a reason we can’t live forever; our bodies start breaking down as things stop working.”</p>
<p>“Oh. That makes sense.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know how old people get in this world, but the oldest people from my world are around a hundred years old. Rarely more than that.”</p>
<p>“A hundred? That’s a lot! Old man Schnel died when he was 62, and he was <em>old.</em>”</p>
<p>“Well, some things affect how old you’ll grow. Some of it is just chance or your body, but what you eat, how you live—all of that can affect your health. Like food. Remember what I said about a balanced meal?”</p>
<p>“Um…”</p>
<p>It’s fun teaching Durene the basics of biology, science, and so on. I didn’t really feel like math was that important and her speaking skills are good—she can’t write though, and I can’t help her with that.</p>
<p>No one taught her. But I will. Not everything will be necessarily that practical, but I hope some of it will help. Durene drinks down all of my lessons like a sponge as we harvest and cook. Helping her grow is something that makes me happy. It’s what an [Emperor] would do. What I will do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 17</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>More harvesting. Apparently, the other villagers are also making their last harvests of the season. They might get one more yield from their crops, but maybe not. We’re storing a lot of Durene’s goods in the cellar.</p>
<p>…I had no idea her house <em>had</em> a cellar, but she has a rather large root cellar outside! That’s one of the things that blows me away; I would have never guessed there was a trapdoor right over there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 19</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I leveled up last night! I am now a Level 2 [Emperor]. What triggered the change? Durene has no idea, but I think I know. She’s my subject. Teaching her and tending to this small cottage which I claimed as my own is the same as improving my empire, all of it in fact. It’s all about perception. Perhaps there is a limit to how much exp I’d get this way, but for now I’ll take what I can get.</p>
<p>No idea what the extra level will do for me, though. I haven’t gotten any skills and still haven’t figured out the [Aura of the Emperor] yet.</p>
<p>Hmm…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 20</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I wake up when I hear the oddest sound. Footsteps; Durene’s. Crunching.</p>
<p>Now, footsteps are generally easy for me. I can tell some people apart by how they walk. There’s a tempo to their pace, and of course weight makes their footsteps sound different too. Durene is clearly distinct.</p>
<p>But what is she stepping <em>on?</em> It can’t be what I think it is.</p>
<p>“Snow?”</p>
<p>It <em>is</em> snow! Apparently the entire world decided to up and change as I slept. Durene tells me the Winter Sprites must have brought snow to the region, which makes me wonder if she doesn’t understand how the weather works.</p>
<p>But no—apparently in this world, weird dancing lights known as Winter Sprites can manipulate the weather. They’re also a bit of a hazard, according to Durene. They’ll throw snow at you if you bother them or play tricks.</p>
<p>That doesn’t quite make sense, but the important thing is clear: it’s winter. And oh boy, it’s <em>cold!</em></p>
<p>I help Durene strike some sparks into the fireplace of her cottage. She had to run outside for some firewood early in the morning.</p>
<p>“I usually keep a pile inside, but I forgot to this year. The wood’s a bit wet, but I think it’ll light.”</p>
<p>Durene sneezes after she says this. She sounds cold. And there’s an unpleasant amount of chill in her house without a roaring fire in her fireplace. I said her home was cozy, but it’s apparent that Durene could use a better house, like the ones in the village perhaps.</p>
<p>Frustrating. That’s what it is. I help make a thick soup while Durene clears snow, brings in chopped firewood and so on, and we have a hearty meal. But I can’t help but feel like I am a drag now that snow is making it practically impossible for me to find my way around outside.</p>
<p>It takes a while for the fire to start, but once it does we’re warm again. Durene claims she can chop enough wood for the winter and she’s hopeful about food—she says she had a good harvest, but this is living closer to the edge than I’d like. There are no supermarkets here.</p>
<p>At least we have some winter clothes. The villagers sent some clothes up with Prosts’s wife, Yesel. She came by around midday, with some coats and other garments for me. Good thing too—I was getting tired of my one set of clothes.</p>
<p>Etiquette demands we offer her something to eat and some of the now wonderfully warm mint tea. I chat with Yesel; she’s quite happy to chatter on with me while Durene listens. It’s very nice, but I sense the way she talks to Durene. And the way she hints to me.</p>
<p>“We’d be happy to put you up in our home for a few days. Just until the first chill goes away. The children could squeeze together in one room I’m sure.”</p>
<p>She’s not even really hinting. She’s flat out telling me she wants me to go back with her into the village. And Durene’s clearly unhappy about it, but she doesn’t want to object.</p>
<p>I sip my tea calmly. What’s the best answer here? Well, clearly: no.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry Miss Yesel, but Durene’s made such a nice place for me—we just got the second cot set up. I’d love to join you for a meal or two later, but for now I feel I should stay here. I’d hate to be out on the road in my condition, you know.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes. I’ve made a good spot for myself, Miss Yesel. And I can get everything Laken needs here—”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you have, Durene.”</p>
<p>Yesel interrupts Durene politely. I get the feeling she’s not actually smiling, but her tone sounds friendly as she reaches out to touch my hand. I jerk and she takes her hand back. I <em>hate</em> it when people touch me without&nbsp; warning me.</p>
<p>“Do excuse me. But I’m sure we could get Durene to pull the wagon if you don’t want to walk. It would only be a few minutes’ trip.”</p>
<p>So polite. So friendly. I can feel the invisible looks she’s giving Durene. My skin prickles, but I smile in her direction.</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, I’d truly hate to take over your rooms. Kids should have a lot of space, and I wouldn’t want to cramp you all.”</p>
<p>Now she’s hesitating. I know for a fact that my poker face is perfect; but she can’t quite tell if I’m innocently being obtuse or refusing her. Now she takes a different tack.</p>
<p>“Well—the Beetrs have also said they’d be delighted if you came over for dinner. And they have an empty room after their daughter sadly passed away last summer. You could join them. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“Mm…well…”</p>
<p>“It would be so much larger than here. I know Durene has done her best, but isn’t this a tiny bit too small for two people?”</p>
<p>“I—I could sleep outside! Or in the root cellar. I’m fine with—”</p>
<p>“I actually like the closeness, in fact.”</p>
<p>This time it’s my turn to interrupt Durene. I smile placidly, although I’m getting more and more annoyed by the second. I can sense Yesel reacting across the table.</p>
<p>“I think I’m fine, I really am, Miss Yesel. Durene is an excellent hostess. She’s helped me out immeasurably and I have every confidence that she will continue to do so.”</p>
<p>Durene’s silent, possibly embarrassed, and Yesel is quiet. Then she speaks to Durene directly.</p>
<p>“Durene? Why don’t you go fetch us some more firewood? I’m sure Mister Laken is feeling quite chilly.”</p>
<p>I bite my lip as Durene rises without a word to do as Yesel says. <em>Mister Laken</em> is feeling fine, thanks. And Durene shouldn’t have to obey someone else’s order in her own home.</p>
<p>But because Yesel is giving us a gift and because I don’t have the full picture—not yet—I listen. Yesel leans forwards to talk to me as I hear Durene moving about outside.</p>
<p>“Durene is a good child, Mister Laken. Sometimes. But we put her out here so she wouldn’t cause trouble if—has she told you what she is?”</p>
<p>“No. I believe she will tell me when she feels comfortable.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but—I think you don’t quite understand what the problem is.”</p>
<p>I raise one eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Problem? I haven’t had a problem with Durene, Miss Yesel. Unless you think otherwise?”</p>
<p>“No…”</p>
<p>She says it, clearly meaning the opposite. I hear a slurp, and then her voice again.</p>
<p>“But some of us in the village—Durene was wonderfully good about taking you in, but she’s not someone that should be kept cooped up with you—with someone like you—all winter. It would be better for everyone if you stayed in the village. We’d love to have you.”</p>
<p>And I’d probably hate it there. I listen to Durene lifting something with a grunt, and then shake my head.</p>
<p>“I have no problems with Durene, Miss Yesel. I will stay here.”</p>
<p>Now frustration enters the other woman’s voice.</p>
<p>“I really don’t think that’s wise. Durene is—”</p>
<p>“—Is Durene. I think that’s what you meant to say, Miss Yesel. Please don’t say anything else. I prefer to let people keep their secrets.”</p>
<p>“But—!”</p>
<p>This has gone on long enough. I stand up.</p>
<p>“Good day, Miss Yesel. Thank you for the clothes.”</p>
<p>There’s not much she can say after that. I practically chase her out, and Durene, covered in snow and bewildered, barely gets to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe it was rude to bundle the woman off so fast, but she was being incredibly rude. I know Durene has a secret, but why wouldn’t they trust her with me? I’ve slept under her roof for over two weeks now without a problem.</p>
<p>It’s cozy and warm in Durene’s cottage after Yesel leaves. I’m perfectly content, and Durene is almost pathetically relieved that I’m staying. She keeps chattering nervously about everything but what that conversation meant.</p>
<p>It occurs to me later what the problem is. I don’t have a problem with Durene, no matter who she really is. But Yesel and the other villagers don’t like that I don’t care.</p>
<p>Not one bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 22</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve just begun to adjust to the new circumstances of freezing weather. It’s impossible for me to really find my way around outside without Durene, but we can still go walking in the snow. Of course, I have to be bundled up like a sausage, but that’s okay.</p>
<p>And it’s not like we lack things to do inside. There’s still so much that no one ever taught Durene—whether because this world doesn’t have any standard of education or because no one taught her specifically, and I enjoy talking with her.</p>
<p>But sometimes we do crave the outside, if only to perform vital tasks. Despite the decent construction, Durene’s outhouse freezes all my bits the moment I try to do my business. That makes everything slower, but she waits patiently for me as I attempt to speed up my natural body processes.</p>
<p>That’s when I hear the laughter, and the malicious voices. Children—the village children—come running up the path towards Durene’s cottage as I sit in the outhouse.</p>
<p>“Freak! Come out, Freak!”</p>
<p>“There she is! Get her!”</p>
<p>It’s like listening to a movie, only I’m sitting in a freezing-cold movie theatre and I don’t have a bag of popcorn. And this is real, so my heart immediately pounds harder when I hear Durene’s voice.</p>
<p>“Ow! Stop!”</p>
<p>What’s happening? I hear <em>paffs,</em> the sound of snow hitting—</p>
<p>Snowballs. Those little bastards are throwing snowballs! From the sounds outside Durene isn’t doing anything, just trying to shield herself. But the children are laughing.</p>
<p>“Get her! She’s a [Witch]!”</p>
<p>“She’s tricking the blind man! Let’s slay the Freak!”</p>
<p>“I’m not! I—<em>ow!</em>”</p>
<p>More laughter, and the sounds of more snowballs being thrown. I fumble with my pants, trying to think of what to do as the situation outside escalates.</p>
<p>Those—there’s a difference between having fun and being malicious little demons. I have to do something. But what?</p>
<p>For a few seconds, I worry about consequences and repercussions. Durene has her own relationship with the villagers. Who am I to interfere with that?</p>
<p>Who am I?</p>
<p>An [Emperor].</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>How could I have forgotten? This house is my empire; Durene is my subject. And those annoying little brats are harassing her. I have a duty to her.</p>
<p>I don’t quite kick the outhouse door open, but I do push it out with more force than normal. Frankly, I’d hate to break the door even in my anger. No one wants to have wind and ice flecks blown right at their private parts in the midst of an intimate moment.</p>
<p>The laughter cuts off as soon as I step into the snow. I turn in the direction of the kids.</p>
<p>“Hey. You lot. Stop that.”</p>
<p>Not exactly fighting words, but I’m deadly serious. And these are just kids. I hear uncomfortable shifting, and then voices.</p>
<p>“What should we—?”</p>
<p>“He don’t know nothing! He’s blind!”</p>
<p>“Yeah! We gotta chase away the Freak!”</p>
<p>I point in their direction.</p>
<p>“I don’t appreciate bullying. Keep away from Durene. If you little bastards throw snow at her again, there <em>will</em> be consequences.”</p>
<p>For two seconds I think that will work. Then one of the children laughs uncertainly. He jeers at me.</p>
<p>“You can’t do nothing! You can’t see!”</p>
<p>“Yeah! He likes the Freak more than real people!”</p>
<p>“Get him!”</p>
<p>Something flies past my face and I flinch back. Crap. Suddenly all the animosity of the gang of children is transferred at me. A snowball filled with ice bursts against my coat and I wonder what I should do next.</p>
<p>“<em>Stop that!</em>”</p>
<p>Something huge interposes itself between me and the children. I feel Durene protectively shielding me.</p>
<p>“Look! The Freak’s in the way!”</p>
<p>“Get her!”</p>
<p>“Throw these! Eat pinecones, Freak!”</p>
<p>Something bounces off Durene and she yelps. That’s when I lose my temper.</p>
<p>“<strong>Enough.</strong>”</p>
<p>I push Durene aside and the word comes out of me like a shout. But it’s not quite a shout. It’s…something else.</p>
<p>The rage burning in my chest ignites, and it attaches to the word. It bursts out, and I feel it leave like a physical thing.</p>
<p>What happened? What did I just do?</p>
<p>I hear screams, and then the sound of someone throwing up. Then I hear footsteps, running, confusion, screams—</p>
<p>Then silence.</p>
<p>“Durene? What’s going on?”</p>
<p>I reach out and touch a thick back covered with cloth. I feel Durene’s cold skin shivering, and then she takes my hand with her callused palms.</p>
<p>“Laken? I—I don’t know. You did something just now. The kids—they’ve all run off!”</p>
<p>“I did that?”</p>
<p>I must have. And it must be—</p>
<p>“[Aura of the Emperor]. Durene, tell me what happened.”</p>
<p>We stand in the snow as Durene tries to relate what happened. According to her, it was suddenly as if I shouted and something <em>hit</em> the kids. She felt a presence—and sudden fear. But what I did wasn’t aimed at her, so it was brief.</p>
<p>The children clearly had a more violent reaction. They made tracks. I don’t know what I did, not exactly, but I can guess.</p>
<p>“I was angry. Seriously pissed. I must have used that to scare them. The aura—I might be able to use that in other ways as well.”</p>
<p>I can remember the sensation. It was physical; like sending part of myself out into the world. It was amazing, and terrifying. I’ve never felt like that before, but I’m glad.</p>
<p>Yes, I’m glad I did it. And so is Durene. In her own way!</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t have done that. You shouldn’t have! There will be trouble—”</p>
<p>“If there is, we’ll be causing the trouble. Those children had no right to harass you.”</p>
<p>“But that’s just them being…”</p>
<p>“That’s them being intolerant idiots. I won’t let anyone do that again. It stops now.”</p>
<p>How? All I know is that I mean every word as Durene and I dry off. How would I stop those kids, outside of using that skill again?</p>
<p>Fence? Too hard, and they’d just climb over it or get around it somehow. Bear trap? Probably not.</p>
<p>“I suppose we could just bury them in the snow head-first next time they come by. I’ll hold their legs; you dig the hole.”</p>
<p>Durene giggles nervously, and I smile as I tell more jokes to make her laugh. But I can’t help but feel like I’ve started something.</p>
<p>I’m right. Not thirty minutes later, I hear someone approaching. Durene tenses up and she tells me Prost has come by. We invite him in, and he gets to business in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>“The kids say you did something, Mister Laken. They weren’t hurt none although they’re fair terrified. But we’d like to know what happened.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you know, Mister Prost. I heard them throwing snowballs and pine cones at Durene and had a word with them. We can’t have children going around attacking people, can we?”</p>
<p>“No, I suppose not. Still, that was a bit of a thing to do over a little thing like that, wasn’t it? I’m sure the children didn’t mean nothing by it. They tease Durene, but there’s nothing in it.”</p>
<p>I keep my voice light and friendly, like a calm before the storm.</p>
<p>“I’m sure you’re right, Mister Prost. I’m sure they didn’t meant anything by the snowballs. Or the name calling.”</p>
<p>He shifts, and I hear Durene swallow.</p>
<p>“Mister Laken, you seem like a nice enough young man. But there’s something you don’t know about Durene.”</p>
<p>“So I’ve been told by you, the children, and your wife. I thought I made it quite clear that I don’t care.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, sir. Durene’s different.”</p>
<p>“Mister Prost—!”</p>
<p>I can almost feel Durene shrinking back. And now I’m even angrier than I was at the kids.</p>
<p>“Stop that. Yes, you, Mister Prost. Durene has been nothing but friendly to me since I arrived here. Your children on the other hand attacked her, and then me.”</p>
<p>“I know that sir, and I’ll make sure they remember it. They won’t be walking straight, you have my promise. But Durene—”</p>
<p>“What is your problem with her?”</p>
<p>I snap. I can’t help it.</p>
<p>“Durene is different. I get that. But what does that matter? She’s a friend. My friend. If she has a secret, she will tell me <em>herself.</em> Now, I think it’s time you leave.”</p>
<p>Prost hesitates, but he doesn’t get up.</p>
<p>“You might think Durene is fine, but you don’t see her like we do. Now, Durene, you’re a good enough girl, but—”</p>
<p>I stand up.</p>
<p>“Enough. I think you should leave, Mister Prost. Now.”</p>
<p>The other man stands up. He’s angry, now.</p>
<p>“You don’t understand the situation, <em>Mister</em> Laken. Durene’s our village’s problem, and she was easy enough to manage before this.”</p>
<p>“I—”</p>
<p>I’d almost forgotten Durene was in the room. She sounds like a mouse—a big one—as she tries to speak.</p>
<p>“I’m not doing anything! I just want to help Laken!”</p>
<p>The other man’s voice is flat as he replies.</p>
<p>“You don’t belong with our kind. You help—but we keep you away for a reason. Remember your father? If his kind came back or you lost control—you’re not like us, Durene. And Mister Laken doesn’t know that!”</p>
<p>“He likes me! He doesn’t care! Why is that so bad?”</p>
<p>For once Durene is arguing back. I don’t respond and let her raise her voice. But now Prost is shouting.</p>
<p>“Don’t you raise your voice to me! Who do you think took you in, fed you? We risked our necks for you!”</p>
<p>“You only did that because my mother asked you to! And you gave me scraps! I had to sleep in the barn with the other animals! I never—never ate with you all! And now you’re trying to take away my only <em>friend!</em>”</p>
<p>Now it comes out. Durene’s voice is filled with emotion, and I can hear her hands cracking the wood of her table as she grips it. There’s a <em>crack</em>, and I feel the table I’m sitting at break.</p>
<p>Prost knocks over his chair and retreats to the door. Durene’s on her feet—not advancing—but I get up before anyone can act.</p>
<p>“That’s enough. Prost, it’s time for you to go. I’m staying here with Durene, and nothing you tell me is going to change that.”</p>
<p>“But you don’t understand!”</p>
<p>It sounds like Prost is nearly tearing out his hair—if he has any—in frustration. But he’s afraid of Durene as well, I can tell.</p>
<p>Durene’s voice is cold.</p>
<p>“If that’s what Laken says, he stays. I’ll take care of him here. Now, you’ve gotta leave, Mister Prost. This is my house, and you’re not welcome here any longer.”</p>
<p>She advances, and I hear the man rush out the door. I follow Durene out, and hear Prost’s voice. He’s far away from us but shouting.</p>
<p>“Do you know what she <em>is!? </em>She’s a monster! A freak!”</p>
<p>My pulse is boiling in my veins. I glare in his direction.</p>
<p>“<em>I don’t care.</em> Go away and stop bothering us!”</p>
<p>“You don’t know anything, boy! She’s tricking you by acting friendly, but her kind can’t be trusted! She’s a monster. She’s not Human she’s a—”</p>
<p>“A Troll!”</p>
<p>The word doesn’t come from Prost’s mouth. It comes from Durene, a shout. My heart skips a beat, and then I hear her shouting.</p>
<p>“<em>Troll!</em> There! I said it! Troll, Troll, <em>Troll!</em>”</p>
<p>Her voice is huge. Huge and deep, and it’s so loud I swear snow is falling from the trees. She <em>screams</em> at Prost, leaving the man speechless.</p>
<p>“Why can’t you let me have this? Why did you have to <em>tell</em> him? What harm would it have done if I—”</p>
<p>Durene is crying, sobbing as she shouts as loudly as she can. She rails against Prost, cursing him. I hear an impact and sense she’s fallen to her knees. In the next silence I listen and hear distant crunching in the snow.</p>
<p>“He’s running.”</p>
<p>Coward. My heart is beating too fast, and I feel something clenching at it. I’m furious, but right now Durene is more important.</p>
<p>Slowly, I step forwards towards her, reaching my hand out. I touch her—and her rough skin slides under my fingertips. She makes no move; only sobbing as I slowly touch her.</p>
<p>Arm. Rough arm, practically bursting the seams of her clumsily-sewn clothing. And then up to her shoulder, twice as broad as mine. Her muscle is as dense as a rock, and her skin feels like an elephant’s hide.</p>
<p>Then her neck, her head. It’s like a Human’s but big enough for her body. Her nose is…wide, and she has eyebrows. And hair. Long and coarser than Human hair, but not by much.</p>
<p>That’s the secret. That’s what she feared. Her terrible, meaningless, sad secret. But she told one lie, and as I touch her face, I know. I see everything.</p>
<p>I murmur the words into the snow as I touch her tears.</p>
<p>“Half-Troll.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Emperor Level 4!]</p>
<p>[Skill – King’s Bounty obtained!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 23</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Troll. What do you think of when you hear that word? I’m told that movies have wonderful images of Trolls, but I have obviously never seen them.</p>
<p>So I can only work off the descriptions of Trolls I’ve read in stories. When I first read <em>The Hobbit,</em> my notion of Trolls were these slightly bigger-than-average Humans with cockney accents and weird names. One of them was called Bert, for goodness sake!</p>
<p>But then I listened to The Lord of the Rings movie, and my idea of Trolls was different. The idea of some massive, grey humanoid creature that roared and swung a club around fixed itself in my head. Even when I read the descriptions of green Trolls with noxious odors, the image of the Troll with stone-like skin and savage, dimwitted rage stayed with me.</p>
<p>That is not Durene. So when I listened to her, I threw away all the notions and preconceptions I had about Trolls. All of them. I put the stories I’d heard in a box and tossed it out, because she deserves to tell me who she is rather than have me judge her before I know her.</p>
<p>And I do know Durene. She isn’t violent. She isn’t angry. And from what she tells me, neither are Trolls.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know my father. He was—he was a wandering Troll, and I think he met my mom during the Spring. He was hungry and she was living by herself and—”</p>
<p>Trolls are monsters. Everyone considers them as such, apparently. They don’t have a civilization like Drakes or Gnolls, but they are smarter than your average monster. Smart as a Goblin, which might not be saying much. I don’t know. But not all Trolls are violent.</p>
<p>“He must not have been hungry, because he didn’t eat my mom. Not all Trolls eat…people.”</p>
<p>We sit together in Durene’s home as she tells me everything. The fire crackles, but aside from that, everything else is quiet. I sit silently at her broken table, listening as Durene’s low voice speaks into the silence.</p>
<p>She’s done crying. All the grief and fear of last night is gone, and now the truth comes out of her. All the things she wanted to tell me, spilling out. I can feel the fear in her voice, that I’ll judge her, run from her. Fear her. I listen to it all in silence.</p>
<p>“Mom was living alone, away from the others. She’d been married—I think she’d had a husband before, and another kid. But she lost both so she had a small farm by herself. And Dad was hungry, so she found him in her fields. And I guess she must have liked him, or gotten to know him somehow, because a few weeks later she was pregnant.”</p>
<p>“That’s how they met?”</p>
<p>Durene shifts.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Mom never said, and the villagers just said that Miss Yesel came up one day and found her pregnant and alone. And Troll tracks nearby. I think that’s how it happened. I hope it is. Otherwise…”</p>
<p>Otherwise, her mother was attacked by a Troll. And Durene will never know which is true, because her mother is dead and none of the other villagers were there. But they speculated, and Durene probably grew up hearing that speculation.</p>
<p>“Anyways, they let Mom stay, but an adventurer heard about a Troll and came to kill it. He—he did. And afterwards, he wanted to kill me too, but Mom wouldn’t let him.”</p>
<p>“Did she raise you alone?”</p>
<p>“She tried. But after I was born she was so weak because I was too big—and she never fully got better. She died when I was four. After that, the village took me in, but I didn’t really have a home.”</p>
<p>Sleeping in a barn. Fed scraps. I can only imagine what it was like.</p>
<p>“When I was bigger, I made my home here, where Mom used to live. I’ve been living here since, and the villagers only call me when they need help. I was alone, and I’d hide every time adventurers came by. I hid from other people too, in case they thought I was dangerous. Until I met you.”</p>
<p>I get it. The crying in the woods, the hope that I wouldn’t immediately judge her, the villagers wanting to separate me from the potentially dangerous half-monster.</p>
<p>It all makes sense. It’s such a predictable story in some ways.</p>
<p>And it’s such crap. Durene doesn’t deserve any of this.</p>
<p>I choose my words carefully in the silence after Durene’s confession. I really don’t know what to say, but I know what <em>not</em> to say.</p>
<p>“Durene. I’m sorry all of this has happened to you. But it doesn’t change anything for me.”</p>
<p>She gulps.</p>
<p>“Laken. I—I’m sorry I lied.”</p>
<p>“That’s okay.”</p>
<p>“No. It’s not. I should have told you. And you don’t have to—to say nice things. You can leave. I’ll bring you into the village and apologize.”</p>
<p>“Why would I do that?”</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I’m staying here. With you.”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>“You being half-Troll doesn’t change anything. I told you that, remember? I got to know you, and that means I won’t run away just because you’re not Human.”</p>
<p>“I—you don’t understand. I’m half <em>Troll.</em> Adventurers would kill me on sight. If I were in a town or a city I’d probably have a bounty put on my head!”</p>
<p>“Probably. But that doesn’t mean I’ll go. It’s okay, Durene.”</p>
<p>“No! Stop being so nice!”</p>
<p>“Durene, calm down. I’m not upset.”</p>
<p>“I know! But—it’s not nothing! Stop being so <em>nice</em> to me! What I am—I’m not Human! I’m not normal! Don’t pretend you don’t care!”</p>
<p>“I care. But I know you.”</p>
<p>“No you don’t. You can’t see—you’d never trust me if you could see.”</p>
<p>“That’s what the villagers have told you. But they’re wrong. They look at you and see a monster but they are wrong. They. Are. Wrong. Do you understand that, Durene?”</p>
<p>“…I can’t. No.”</p>
<p>“Durene? Where are you going? Durene? <em>Durene!</em>”</p>
<p>I’m on my feet as the door slams open. The cold winds of winter rush in, and I hear massive footsteps thumping away. I run after her, shouting.</p>
<p>“Durene!”</p>
<p>Only after I’m outside does it occur to me that maybe I should have given Durene more space. She’s right; I was treating this like nothing. I should have shown more of the surprise swirling inside of me.</p>
<p>But I didn’t want to hurt her feelings and I still meant what I said. How could a girl that nice and caring be a monster?</p>
<p>And now I’m running through the snow, without my cane. I slow the instant I realize that.</p>
<p>Oh shit. The snow is deep around me, I can’t see, and there is nothing like a path that I can follow.</p>
<p>I’m lost.</p>
<p>For a few seconds I just turn, trying to look for my tracks in the snow. But I can’t find them. I shout for Durene, but she’s not coming back. I’m by myself, and I can already feel the cold piercing my clothing.</p>
<p>This is probably a blind person’s worst fear. Without any tools I can barely find my way around, and without people or landmarks in this freezing weather—I’m so dead.</p>
<p>I start walking forwards, trying to feel for anything that reminds me of Durene’s cottage. I don’t have a choice. Either I could stay and hope Durene comes back—and she could be gone for hours—or I try to return to the cottage.</p>
<p>I only ran a little bit outside. But that distance could be miles as far as I’m concerned. This damn snow! It’s falling from the skies and making everything unfamiliar. Even my tracks—I try to kick up as much snow so I can find my way back.</p>
<p>Okay. Let’s go…ten steps this way. No? I feel nothing familiar, so I try to retrace my steps. I find my tracks and get back to roughly where I thought I was before. Now this way. No?</p>
<p>…Where did my tracks go? I spin around, confused. The snow—it’s too thick! I bend down, but my hands feel only the same level of snow around me. It’s as if I never started walking in the first place.</p>
<p>Oh no. I’m starting to panic. I stumble forwards, feeling my way ahead.</p>
<p>Gah! Damn it, I just ran into a <em>tree.</em> That’s bad. I’m in the forest. I try to turn back, but I’m not 100% sure I’m not going further into the forest.</p>
<p>Another tree. And now I’m trying to listen for anything that can help me find my way to Durene’s cottage.</p>
<p>I might die out here. I take a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Durene! I’m lost out here! Can yo—”</p>
<p>I trip. My world shifts and I hit the ground hard. Something just caught my foot! Not a tree root—</p>
<p>I scramble back towards whatever it was in the snow. I’m praying that I tripped over one of Durene’s plants and I’m in her garden.</p>
<p>It’s not a plant. It’s not anything like a plant. Instead, as my aching foot could attest, the object is heavy and partially buried in the ground. I feel at it.</p>
<p>Not a rock…the outside is rough and coarse. A bag? Yes! I can feel the opening here, and two drawstrings. Curious now, despite the cold, I undo the strings.</p>
<p>Is this some kind of bag of fertilizer? But no, why would that…</p>
<p>Hold on. My fingers encounter something hard in the bag and jerk away. I touch again. Something <em>clinks</em> as I shift it.</p>
<p>Round, hard, circular objects. Lots of them. I feel them, lifting one up and dropping it.</p>
<p>“What the hell…?”</p>
<p><em>Clink. Clink</em>.</p>
<p>There’s only one thing that makes that kind of beguiling, attractive sound. And the weight of it! I pull at the bag, but I can’t even get it to shift in the frozen ground.</p>
<p>Is this what I think it is? Really?</p>
<p>“<em>Laken! LAKEN!</em>”</p>
<p>I hear someone shouting my name in the distance. Immediately I stand up and bellow back.</p>
<p>“Durene? <em>Over here!</em>”</p>
<p>Immediately, I hear crashing through the woods. Branches splinter off Durene as she crashes towards my location, showering me with snow. I splutter and then feel two arms around me.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry! I’m <em>so sorry!</em> I didn’t realize you were out here!”</p>
<p>“It’s okay! Durene! You’re squishing me!”</p>
<p>Immediately she lets go. I gasp for air—I’d heard of a bear hug, but this is the first time I actually felt someone literally squashing me.</p>
<p>“Sorry!”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I’m really glad you found me. Durene, I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“No, I—”</p>
<p>I grasp her arm. She falls silent, and I do too. For a few seconds, I just listen to my heart beating, and hear snow softly falling in the background. Durene’s skin is rough under my palms. Rough, but not unpleasant.</p>
<p>“This is the first time I’ve really touched you, you know.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Really. You’ve helped me along, but I normally grab your clothes.”</p>
<p>And she never let me touch her before that. I feel Durene gulp as I hold her.</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>We stand like that in silence for a little while. Then I feel the chill seeping into my bones.</p>
<p>“I guess we should go back.”</p>
<p>“Right! Let me carry you.”</p>
<p>Durene wants to lift me up, but I shake my head.</p>
<p>“I found something in the ground. Can you pull it up?”</p>
<p>“In the ground? Where?”</p>
<p>It takes me a few seconds to find it. Durene covered it when she ran over. But when I show Durene she lifts it up. It sounds like she’s uprooting a huge amount of soil and I cover my face as some of it flies at me.</p>
<p>“What’s this bag? I’ve never. Oh.”</p>
<p>Her voice goes silent all of a sudden. I feel around, and then find the bag in her hands. I reach into the open top and pick out two of the heavy little circular things within.</p>
<p>“Hey Durene. Would you mind telling me what you see? I don’t want to get ahead of myself, but…”</p>
<p>I tap the round object against the second one and hear that delightful chime of metal on metal. Each coin is <em>heavy</em>, and as I weigh them in my hand I notice the rough, smooth stones in the sack as well. Well, well, well.</p>
<p>“I could be wrong, but I hope I’m not. Because unless I’m very much mistaken, this is a gold coin. And this would be buried treasure.”</p>
<p>I’m remarkably calm about that bit. That is, until we get back to the cottage and start counting.</p>
<p>“It’s all gold!”</p>
<p>Durene exclaims as I place another coin on the careful stack of five on the table. I have to move carefully so as not to knock over my stacks, but with Durene’s help we’ve tallied the contents of the mysterious sack at last.</p>
<p>“One hundred and forty one gold coins and eight gemstones.”</p>
<p>I sit back in my chair and reach for the mug of tea. Durene pushes it into my hands and I savor the warmth. I still feel a bit cold after my little exploration outside.</p>
<p>“It’s a fortune. A huge fortune! Where did it come from?”</p>
<p>“I have my suspicions.”</p>
<p>I can sense Durene’s curiosity. I smile. The treasure I found managed to calm Durene down. She forgot about her woes to bask in the radiance of gold. Myself, I can’t see the appeal. It’s just heavy metal to me, but I’m told it’s quite valuable.</p>
<p>And in this case, it’s literally more money than Durene has ever seen in her life. By her estimates, I could literally buy Riverfarm six times over. At least. She has no idea where the money came from, and I tend to doubt that someone would just leave a fortune in the ground like that. But there might be another explanation for my good fortunes.</p>
<p>“[King’s Bounty]. It has to be my Skill.”</p>
<p>It tickles my sense of humor a bit that I got a skill probably meant for [Kings]. I didn’t really have time to even wonder what it meant, but this is a pretty good sign of what the Skill does.</p>
<p>“You mean you got money because of a Skill?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps. It might be that I <em>can’t </em>be poor if I have [King’s Bounty] as a Skill. You know, like how a [King] should never be poor? Haven’t you heard of something like that happening before?”</p>
<p>“No. Never! But—I have heard of [Treasure Hunters] that can find buried treasure. But why would an [Emperor] have that skill?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps because any ruler should have money? Doesn’t it make sense that the Skill would be doing this?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but Skills aren’t normally this powerful! Not at early levels!”</p>
<p>“Right. You mentioned that. Normally people received weaker skills the lower level they are. Only when they’re above Level 30 do the skills become powerful, right? But maybe this <em>is</em> a crummy skill for an [Emperor] by comparison.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it. I can’t.”</p>
<p>“It’s certainly useful, although I wonder how we’ll spend it. There’s not exactly a lot of shops around here.”</p>
<p>“<em>We?</em>”</p>
<p>“I told you Durene, I’m staying with you. And you helped me dig this thing up. Without you, I would have frozen out there in a few more minutes.”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>“Durene.”</p>
<p>I reach out and touch her. This time I get one of her sides. She freezes, but I trace my hands upwards. I find her face, and feel her trembling.</p>
<p>“Durene. I’m going nowhere. And I don’t care if you’re half-Troll or half-Goblin or half-Frog. You are who you are, and I like you for that. You can run, and I might not be able to follow you in the snow, but when you come back, I’ll be waiting. So why not just stay?”</p>
<p>I feel silly, and I’m sure what I said didn’t make too much sense. But Durene trembles, and I feel wetness at my fingers.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to do. I want you to stay, Laken. I do. But what if—what will the others say?”</p>
<p>“What they say is their business. Not yours. I’m asking you if I can stay here, Durene.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Please.”</p>
<p>“Then that’s settled, then.”</p>
<p>“But you and I. I don’t know what I should—I must be so strange to you.”</p>
<p>“Only a bit. But that’s because I don’t know you just yet. I know a lot but…Durene. Will you let me touch you? I can’t see, but I want to get to know you.”</p>
<p>“You—what if you hate me?”</p>
<p>“I never would.”</p>
<p>“Then—can I touch you?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>A rough hand, a finger gently brushes against my face. It feels as light as a feather. I feel at Durene’s face, tracing the contours of her features, trying to understand her in my own way. She touches me, gently, as if she’s never touched another living thing before.</p>
<p>Slowly, I work my way down from her face. Durene shivers, but her touch is just as light. I am curious, and so is she. There’s no words, but I think we understand each other completely in that moment.</p>
<p>No more secrets. No more hidden truths and untrue and unkind words. Just a light touch; an intimate question whispered from one person to another.</p>
<p>And there’s more touching, but I won’t talk too much about that. The snow falls heavily, as inside, Durene and I explore one another. We are who we are. No more.</p>
<p>No less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 24</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I feel like I shouldn’t share much of this day either. Let’s just say that today the pile of gold and jewels went nearly completely untouched, until we accidentally knocked the table over. Turns out gold coins <em>hurt</em> when they’re dropped on your body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 25</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Mm. More of the same, really. But we talked about the future. We talked, and I made her laugh. As we did before. As I hope to do.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Day 27</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A bunch of kids called out for Durene as she and I were having breakfast. They needed help; a roof had collapsed in the village under the weight of the snow and the villagers needed Durene to lift a beam.</p>
<p>I told her not to go. Durene wanted to help. In the end, I waited for her to return. When she did, she was upset.</p>
<p>Tears, hot and wet, fall on my fingertips. Durene’s skin feels a bit like cracked stone as I brush against her cheek. Swords or arrows would have a hard time piercing her skin.</p>
<p>But words? Words cut deepest of all.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to do. I’m not a monster! But they just think I’m like my father. I don’t know what to do. Laken…”</p>
<p>Neither do I. But I can’t bear to see her crying.</p>
<p>“I can’t do anything. Just lift things. Like an animal. That’s all I do. I can’t build or cook. I can barely grow things—”</p>
<p>“Shh.”</p>
<p>It takes her a long time to get to sleep, but eventually it happens. I sit up, anger and sadness fighting like snakes in my belly. What can I do? What could—</p>
<p>What could I do for <em>her?</em></p>
<p>And then I have it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 28</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Is it like a [Knight]?”</p>
<p>“Almost. But better. After all, any ordinary monarch can make a [Knight]. But only an [Emperor] can give someone this class.”</p>
<p>Durene shifts next to me. I hold her hand, and feel her quiver.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure I’m a warrior.”</p>
<p>“Are you a [Farmer]?”</p>
<p>“No. I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>“Then try this. They weren’t always warriors. Culture just interpreted them that way after a while. Before that they were just servants. Great warriors, true, but they served Charlemagne in more ways than just in combat. I think.”</p>
<p>I haven’t actually spent that much time studying the etymology of that class, even though I once played as one in a D&amp;D session. Oh well.</p>
<p>“If you want to be one, I’ll make you one.”</p>
<p>“Just like that? It sounds too easy.”</p>
<p>“It’s not. I’m the only [Emperor] on this continent; only I can choose who is worthy of this class. And of all the people in the world, there’s no one I’d want to be with me than you, Durene.”</p>
<p>“I—please. I don’t want to just be a [Farmer].”</p>
<p>“Then, kneel.”</p>
<p>I feel her bend down in front of me. I reach out and place my hands on her shoulders.</p>
<p>“I knight you, Durene. I name you as my [Paladin], my foremost champion who will protect and serve me. Will you do this?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>She whispers it, then says it louder.</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Something changes. Just a bit. I bend down to Durene and give her a kiss. On the forehead, then elsewhere.</p>
<p>“Is <em>that</em> part of being a [Paladin] too?”</p>
<p>I have to laugh.</p>
<p>“It would be a surprise if it was.”</p>
<p>She rises, and I feel something different about her. It’s subtle. But it comes to me as I’m sleeping. Perhaps it’s not confidence; not yet. There’s no marked change in her, no sudden shift. But there is one thing she has now that she never had. And it’s growing slowly, like one of her seeds.</p>
<p>A purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 29</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m…I’m a [Paladin].”</p>
<p>So Durene says as I wake up. I smile, and hug her, and then she laughs and shouts it.</p>
<p>“I’m a <em>[Paladin]!</em>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 30</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot can happen in a month. In the weather’s case, the atmosphere changed from a nice, pleasantly warm fall to a blizzard-filled winter almost overnight.</p>
<p>Even now, it seems like the snow won’t stop falling. Twice Durene’s gone out to clear a path. She does it quickly and efficiently—even the deepest snow tends to go flying if she exerts herself.</p>
<p>A lot can change in a month for people as well. A young woman who would run from children and names has turned into someone else. Someone confident enough to chase away the obnoxious little monsters who tell her she <em>has </em>to help out a village full of idiots and bigots. She walks and speaks with something else in her now.</p>
<p>And I, I changed quite a lot as well. For one thing, the young man named Laken Godart suddenly became an [Emperor] and found someone to love. That has to be worth something.</p>
<p>In a small cottage a few miles outside of the village of Riverfarm, I sit. I am the Emperor of the Unseen, Protector of Durene’s House. I have one subject—or should that be consort? She is a half-Troll, a young woman named Durene.</p>
<p>And she is beautiful. She was a [Farmer]; now she is a [Paladin]. And what that means neither of us know. I have a bag of gold, and a village full of fools that can’t accept Durene for who she is.</p>
<p>I have no sight, but I have a dream. A grand one, where Durene and I leave this place that she could never call home. Or maybe we change it. But either way I know we will do it. I am an [Emperor], and for her, I would change the world.</p>
<p>And so we shall.</p>
<p>Together.</p>

		<p>Ceria Springwalker stared down at her skeletal hand and for a brief moment, wondered what would happen if she cast [Ice Spike] at point blank range at her face. She’d probably die instantly; in the worst case scenario the shard would lodge in her flesh and brain but fail to kill her.</p>
<p>It was just an idle thought, but she was half-contemplating it. Even horrible mutilation would be preferable to the current situation.</p>
<p>She looked up at the other two members of the Horns of Hammerad sitting around the small fire they’d built. The hazy smoke drifted up, a beacon to any monsters looking for a hot meal. Hopefully none would come; Ceria had tried to camp far enough away from the Ruins of Albez for that, but nasty surprises were always an adventurer’s concern.</p>
<p>Across the fire, Pisces sat on the ground, mumbling quietly to himself as he reviewed his personal spellbook full of notes and spells he was studying. His robes—never too clean at the best of times—were filthy, and he reeked. In fact, he smelled so bad that even Ksmvr, who didn’t really have much of a sense of smell, was sitting far away.</p>
<p>The Antinium had no need of flame. In fact, Ceria thought the fire bothered him a bit. Despite the cold winter weather, the former Prognugator sat with his back to the fire, scanning the landscape. He wasn’t sleeping as he kept watch, but he was so still that he could have been a statue.</p>
<p>Neatly laid out by the Antinium’s side was a shortbow and arrows planted in the ground, ready to be fired. He had one of Erin’s kitchen knives on the ground in front of him, and the enchanted iron shortsword next to it. It was like Ksmvr expected an attack at any moment.</p>
<p>Ceria sighed. Then she stared back at her skeletal hand again. It didn’t hurt. Not anymore. But it felt like it was still covered in flesh, sometimes. But she had to use magic—let it flow into her missing limb—to make it move. And when she touched things, that was the worst. Then she <em>felt</em> as if she could feel something, but it was just her imagination.</p>
<p>The fire coughed and Pisces sneezed into it. Ceria made a face as a wisp of smoke drifted her way. Pisces really did need a bath. She could probably conjure some water out of the air, but it would be a waste of mana. Plus, if she was going to clean him she might as well start with herself.</p>
<p>Ceria wasn’t a stranger to roughing it. She’d spent countless nights outside before she passed her second decade, and she’d gone on countless expeditions with the original Horns of Hammerad, tracking monsters, preparing for dungeon dives, and so on.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t remember camping out&nbsp;ever being this pitiful. Ceria knew that she smelled about half as bad as Pisces, and dried sweat, grime, and unwashed clothing was making her own personal experience unpleasant.</p>
<p>At least they weren’t camping in the snow again. Ceria and Pisces had cleared the ground of the stuff, and it wasn’t snowing like it had last night. Normally Ceria would have liked to camp in a cave, but the Ruins of Albez were part of a natural depression in the ground far from any helpful mountains or hills. The ruined building had sunk into the earth, and so any normal group of adventurers planning to stay in the area for more than one day brought tents.</p>
<p>But they didn’t have any, because they couldn’t afford them. In fact, the Horns of Hammerad hadn’t planned on staying long in any case. They’d brought enough supplies for two days.</p>
<p>This was their eighth night. All of them had yet to eat.</p>
<p>Ceria’s stomach growled and she made a face. Hunger was also something she’d gotten used to when she was young, but she couldn’t ever remember really running out of food in the Horns of Hammerad. For all his temperamental issues, Calruz had been a good soldier and leader in keeping his group fed and outfitted, and Gerial had always left a margin of error when buying gear.</p>
<p>Her heart twinged as she remembered them. Ceria stared back into the fire as Pisces clicked his tongue. Her stomach growled again.</p>
<p>Only—that wasn’t a growl. That was the faint <em>crunch</em> of something in the snow. Ceria instantly looked up and began focusing mana into her skeletal hand. She saw Ksmvr grab his bow and an arrow. Pisces sat in front of the fire, oblivious as he nibbled at a dirty fingernail.</p>
<p>“<em>Pisces.</em>”</p>
<p>Ceria kept her voice low as she hissed at him. Pisces took no notice. Ceria was about to snap at him even if it meant warning whatever was approaching when she heard a voice.</p>
<p>“It’s me, Ceria.”</p>
<p>Instantly, Ceria relaxed. Ksmvr lowered his bow as Yvlon approached. The armored woman walked towards the campfire and tiredly slung a pack to the ground.</p>
<p>“Food and another shovel.”</p>
<p>She tossed the shovel on the ground as well, nearly hitting the fire. Pisces looked up and sniffed at the tool. Then he went back to reading.</p>
<p>Yvlon eyed the mage, and then laboriously sat down. She began trying to take off her silver armor, equally dirty from time spent outdoors. Ceria went to help; she’d helped her fellow adventurers more than once and she knew how it was done.</p>
<p>Ksmvr came over too. He sat respectfully away from everyone else, which was probably for the best.</p>
<p>“Comrade Yvlon. Does our team have permission to reenter the ruins tomorrow?”</p>
<p>Yvlon barely paused at Ksmvr’s odd address. She nodded tiredly.</p>
<p>“That’s what the City Runner said. No team wants to go to the ruins; they’re all busy with local requests or getting ready to enter that dungeon in Liscor.”</p>
<p>“I see. That is optimal.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr nodded several times. Ceria’s face didn’t really smile; her lips just sort of twisted. Yvlon was making the same face.</p>
<p>“Apparently, the [Dangersense] surge we felt came from that dungeon. No word on whether something else happened; mages would have gotten a message if something nasty came out.”</p>
<p>“Still. That’s some danger in there if <em>that’s</em> what happened from just opening the front door.”</p>
<p>Ceria muttered as she helped Yvlon take off the breastplate. The other woman nodded.</p>
<p>“More teams are coming down from the northern cities. Big names. Griffon Hunt and the Halfseekers are going to have competition if they don’t clear the dungeon soon.”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Ceria had too many emotions and feelings about the new dungeon to put into words. Yvlon clearly felt the same way, because she didn’t elaborate. Ceria had just finished helping her take off the last of her armor when she exclaimed in annoyance.</p>
<p>“<em>Pisces! </em>Get your hands out of the food!”</p>
<p>The young man paused as he lifted a sausage out of the bag Yvlon had brought. He sniffed at Ceria.</p>
<p>“I am feeding myself, Springwalker.”</p>
<p>“We’ll make food for everyone in a little bit. Your hands are <em>filthy.</em>”</p>
<p>“I am hungry.”</p>
<p>Yvlon didn’t say anything, but Ceria had to seriously stop herself from blasting Pisces with a spell there and then. She modulated her tone only slightly.</p>
<p>“We all are. But we eat and work together as a team. Put the food back.”</p>
<p>Pisces held her gaze for a second, and then made an irritated sound. He tossed the sausage back at the bag and missed. It landed in the dirt next to the fire.</p>
<p>Yvlon twitched. But she didn’t say anything. Ceria counted to five before she picked the dried sausage up and washed it off. A stream of water flowed from her skeletal fingertip and over the sausage, cleaning the dirt off.</p>
<p>“How far did you have to walk to get to the Runner, Yvlon?”</p>
<p>“Four, five miles? She wouldn’t come any closer.”</p>
<p>“<em>Five miles?</em>”</p>
<p>Ceria ground her teeth. Yvlon only shrugged tiredly.</p>
<p>“Makes you wish Ryoka were in the area, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>It did. City Runners were notorious for refusing to get near monsters or dangerous areas when delivering resupplies to adventurers—they were useful because they could save a day or more of travel, but they charged high prices and inconvenienced the adventurers who had to go and meet them.</p>
<p>“If I’d known you would have had to walk that far in the snow, I’d have sent Ksmvr with you.”</p>
<p>“Then the Runner would have just run away.”</p>
<p>Pisces unhelpfully interjected this as he stared at the bread and other food Ceria had purchased with their dwindling coin. The half-Elf scowled as she pulled out a block of cheese and stared at it.</p>
<p>“I told them half a block of cheese. Who’s taking down messages in that damn building?”</p>
<p>The custom for adventurers was to use the [Message] spell to send requests for gear, supplies, or even potions to the local Mage’s Guild or similar buildings in cities. Depending on the urgency of the request (which naturally raised the price of the delivery exponentially), the guild would deliver the request to the local Runner’s Guild where someone would hopefully fulfill it.</p>
<p>Really, it was a gamble sometimes. Prices were very high for deliveries, but most City Runners didn’t like to take the risk of getting near a hotspot for monsters anyways. And when they did, they often waited far away from the actual requested delivery site, shining bullseye lanterns to let adventurers know they had to come out to pick up their package. And the <em>cost—</em></p>
<p>“How much do we have left, Yvlon?”</p>
<p>“Do you want the good news or the bad news?”</p>
<p>“Good news.”</p>
<p>“We’ve got <em>one </em>gold coin left.”</p>
<p>Yvlon lifted up the empty money pouch and shook it. Even Pisces looked dismayed at that.</p>
<p>“That’s <em>it?</em> How much did the Runner charge?”</p>
<p>“About average. But we didn’t have that much to begin with, and this was the only way to get the food quickly.”</p>
<p>Ceria ground her teeth as she accepted the money pouch from Yvlon. That was the last of their coin, which meant their future was pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>“We’ve got food for two more days, then. If we can’t find what we’re looking for by then, it’s over.”</p>
<p>Over. Ceria watched her three teammates react differently to the news.</p>
<p>Yvlon had the best reaction. She was a seasoned adventurer and a former Silver-rank team Captain. She just nodded, resigned to the outcome. She didn’t like it clearly; her eyes were tight, but she knew that they had no other choice.</p>
<p>Ksmvr was interesting. He didn’t even look that bothered by the news. He just nodded, and went back to studying the landscape. Didn’t he care? Or did he put all his faith in her decisions? Either way, Ceria would have liked more emotion from him.</p>
<p>And less from Pisces. The young man’s eyebrows snapped together furiously.</p>
<p>“Then what? We just give <em>up?</em>”</p>
<p>“If we have to. We don’t have the coin to keep searching, Pisces.”</p>
<p>“Then what do we do, Springwalker? Do we go back and start taking other requests?”</p>
<p>“Maybe. If we have to. Unless you’ve got another idea?”</p>
<p>Pisces stared at her. He was grumpy, tired, and hungry. In short, he had the exact same mood as everyone else in the group. But he was also annoying, and he never hesitated to make his opinions clear.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I would wish to continue my association with this group afterwards. I have as of late begun to question the merits of lending my services to this team.”</p>
<p>Yvlon frowned, probably trying to decode Pisces’ comment, and then out of genuine anger. Ceria didn’t rise to the bait. She just nodded.</p>
<p>“Fine. You want to quit? Do it after tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Pisces hesitated.</p>
<p>“Our searching would be much improved if you took <em>my</em> opinions.”</p>
<p>“We tried that. Didn’t work.”</p>
<p>Ceria pulled a knife out of its sheathe at her side. She began slicing the sausage into chunks and getting a meal ready. Ksmvr came over to help her as Pisces scowled and kept talking.</p>
<p>“One mistake hardly disqualifies my methods. We might have found the secret rooms by now if—”</p>
<p>“We didn’t. And we’ve checked a lot of damn places. Drop it, Pisces.”</p>
<p>“I came here under the assumption that we would find—”</p>
<p>“So did we all.”</p>
<p>Yvlon interrupted. She stared hard at Pisces. It was the first time in a while that Ceria remembered the other woman taking an active stance. But even her patience had limits. She glared at Pisces, but the other mage was hardly impressed.</p>
<p>“We all took a risk on this expedition, Pisces. If it fails, it’s no one’s fault. We just had bad luck.”</p>
<p>“Inefficiency, perhaps.”</p>
<p>“You think you could do better than a group of four?”</p>
<p>“If I had undead—”</p>
<p>Yvlon’s brows drew together. Ceria interrupted as she finished squishing some of the cheese into the hard shell of the bread with the sausage.</p>
<p>“If you did, the local Watch would have shot you full of arrows at Esthelm. And even if you got them here, those Shield Spiders would have eaten your leg before your shambling zombies got close enough to pull you out of their nest.”</p>
<p>Ceria glared at Pisces. She was tired of his constant complaints. It hadn’t been bad at first; he hadn’t been annoyed until around day four. But then, it had been another burden to bear. But this last day he had been incessant.</p>
<p>The half-Elf and unhappy Captain of the Horns of Hammerad rubbed at her forehead, searching for a moderately diplomatic response.</p>
<p>“We’re all tired. We’re all frustrated. But only you keep complaining. Why don’t you keep quiet for a while, Pisces?”</p>
<p>Even Ksmvr nodded. He carefully handed the sandwich he’d made to Yvlon. The human woman hesitated, but accepted it reluctantly. She eyed the sandwich and paused for a good few seconds before biting it. Ceria saw Yvlon glance at Ksmvr, but the Antinium didn’t seem to notice.</p>
<p>“Ksmvr. Do you want another sandwich?”</p>
<p>“I will have just cheese on mine if that is acceptable.”</p>
<p>“Fine.”</p>
<p>The Antinium immediately loaded up his sandwich with a double-helping of cheese. Ceria, taking his example, added twice as much meat to hers instead of cheese. Ever since the Antinium had gotten past his allergy to gluten thanks to the magical charm he’d been eating cheese sandwiches almost exclusively.</p>
<p>Pisces hadn’t made a sandwich yet. Ceria began assembling one, even though she privately would have rather made him do it. But then he might eat more than they could afford for the night, so she did it anyways. Pisces observed her working and commented with an acerbic tone as she was nearly done.</p>
<p>“Just so you know, I would never animate zombies to begin with. They are an inefficient use of mana, unless used as immediate shields. Ghouls or skeletons would be—”</p>
<p>“Dead <em>gods</em>, Pisces! Shut up! Just eat and we’ll talk about this tomorrow, alright?”</p>
<p>Her fragile temper snapped. Ceria hurled the sandwich she’d made at Pisces. He stopped the flying food in the air with a hand and an affronted look. But he did shut up.</p>
<p>The food was cold, somewhat hard to chew, and could have benefited from some time near the fire. But all four adventurers were so hungry that they scarfed down the food in seconds. Ceria could have used a second helping, but she knew that was all they could afford to eat.</p>
<p>After that, they just sat around. Miserable. It really was miserable. Everyone stank a bit, but no one wanted to wash in this freezing weather. They were tired and uncomfortable, but at least they’d had something to eat.</p>
<p>It wasn’t so much a spoken word, but sheer exhaustion that made all four begin grabbing their blankets. Ceria shivered even when she wrapped the cold, rough fabric around herself. She moved closer to the fire and saw that Yvlon and Pisces had done the same.</p>
<p>No one talked. Ksmvr neatly unpacked his blanket and then paused. He looked around at the other three, two humans and one half-Elf.</p>
<p>“It appeared that our preparations were decently sound. And our objective had much merit. Our approach was correct, and we have taken many optimal approaches. Yet we have thus far failed to achieve our goals. What went wrong?”</p>
<p>No one had an answer to that. They curled up in their blankets or in Ksmvr’s case, sat with it draped around his body. It was a cold night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day dawned cold and early. Ceria woke up shivering in her blankets. She should have used an ice resistance spell she reflected, but she needed to conserve mana. Plus…she’d never really studied those in Wistram. Ironic, really.</p>
<p>Yvlon rolled out of her bedding at around the same time Ceria got up, and Ksmvr was already awake, if he’d ever slept. Only Pisces snoozed on, incredibly ignoring the cold weather, which suited the others just fine.</p>
<p>“Hot porridge. No spices, no fruits.”</p>
<p>Yvlon handed Ceria a bowl. The half-Elf warmed her good hand as she held the food and shrugged.</p>
<p>“I’ve had worse. Want to look over the map as we eat?”</p>
<p>The young Human woman made an unhappy face.</p>
<p>“I guess so.”</p>
<p>Ceria dreaded looking at the map too, to be honest. It was like staring at a piece of pie held just out of reach. Everything looked perfectly simple at first glance.</p>
<p>See the treasure? See the secret rooms? There’s the treasure. But finding it—</p>
<p>“Okay, we tried digging around the ruined dome building yesterday, but there’s nothing that even remotely resembles the other structures on the map. So we have to assume that area’s lost or completely buried.”</p>
<p>Ceria pointed to a section of the map where a familiar dome-like structure was connected to what she could only see as a secret room. Yvlon nodded as she and Ksmvr stood around the map, staring hard at the places Ceria had marked.</p>
<p>“We have attempted numerous times to visit the second secret location in vain. It may be this section was also already claimed by previous searchers.”</p>
<p>Here was the problem: they had a map. And it was a good one; it showed Albez as it had been, a sprawling city complete with the secret passages and rooms that surely contained treasure. But the map did not reflect current reality.</p>
<p>The three Horns of Hammerad stood on a small bluff overlooking the ruins. Unlike the tidy map of the city, the ruins were, well, a mess.</p>
<p>Dead soil and dried-up vegetation was the landscape that made up Albez’s tomb. But the city itself had not fallen to magic or sword as far as Ceria could tell. It had simply…disappeared into the earth.</p>
<p>Maybe a mudslide had covered it. Or an earthquake had engulfed the city. But it had sunk below the earth, becoming covered by time and dirt until some expedition had uncovered it. Since then, the entire area had turned into a basin filled with half-buried walls and lovely pitfalls that connected a subterranean landscape with the rest of the world. And after all these many hundreds, thousands of years, everything had changed.</p>
<p>Parts of the ruins had shifted in the earth, somehow. Entire passages had moved out of place, and some of the buildings on Ceria’s map were in the wrong places. Worse, some were in the right place as far as she could tell, which made searching even more confusing.</p>
<p>“We know the passage here leads to a secret room. But if we follow it, we get nothing. Just rubble and dirt. We might be able to find the room if we had a team of [Diggers] and [Miners], but we don’t.”</p>
<p>Ceria crossed out another potential treasure site with a bit of charcoal on the map. She eyed the remaining spots they’d pinpointed nearly a week ago. Honestly, it felt like a lifetime. All that hope they’d had had quickly dissipated as they’d gone from spot to spot, digging in the crumbling soil for traces of something they’d never found.</p>
<p>Yvlon squinted at a ragged piece of blue cloth tied to a wooden pole. She pointed.</p>
<p>“We found that marker right around the room marked here. See? I think someone must have claimed that spot.”</p>
<p>That was probably true. Ceria nodded glumly. Searchers often marked their finds with flags or magical signs only they could read in case they’d stumbled onto part of a larger haul.</p>
<p>Ksmvr looked confused. At least, Ceria assumed he was confused. He certainly sounded like it.</p>
<p>“How would someone locate a secret room without a map such as this? Or have other groups obtained similar information sources?”</p>
<p>“Not necessarily. They might have had a [Treasure Hunter]. It’s a rare class, but a high-level one might have had a skill that located a major haul.”</p>
<p>“Are we to assume all the places here have been looted, then?”</p>
<p>Both Ceria and Yvlon shook their heads instantly. If that was the case, they wouldn’t have risked so much on this.</p>
<p>“Even someone with Skills can’t find everything. Especially if the places are guarded. We’ve just been unlucky, or hitting places already searched. We need to go somewhere else today.”</p>
<p>“How about over here? There’s several rooms that belonged to some sort of complex. And a passage here and here…worth a shot?”</p>
<p>Studying the places Yvlon had pointed to, Ceria had to agree that it looked like there was a secret passage over there as well. She nodded.</p>
<p>“I think that spot matches that depression over to the east, don’t you? We’ll head for that after Pisces wakes up, then.”</p>
<p>It took a few kicks for the mage to wake up. He was grumpy when he found only a bit of porridge was left for his breakfast, and even unhappier when he found they’d decided on the next place to search without him.</p>
<p>“I thought adventurers considered all opinions and made informed decisions, rather than rashly coming to conclusion without all input.”</p>
<p>“We’d do that if you woke up earlier. If you’ve got a more likely spot to search, find it.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t, which only made Pisces more grumpy. The Horns of Hammerad struck camp and began cautiously picking their way across the snowy ground towards the ruins, letting Ksmvr take point.</p>
<p>Even as they were moving across the ruins, the group moved slowly, keeping an eye out for anything moving in the snow or strange sounds. Monsters were common around magical sites and the ruins were a known dangerous spot.</p>
<p>However, aside from a nasty run in with a small nest of Shield Spiders, the Horns of Hammerad hadn’t run into many monsters. That bothered Ceria. She didn’t like <em>not</em> having trouble, especially here.</p>
<p>The Horns of Hammerad under Calruz had gone on four different occasions into Albez, looking for treasure like all of the other Silver-rank teams in the area. It was practically a rite of passage; if you could survive Albez, you were ready for harder requests.</p>
<p>But even during the easiest time they’d had here in the past – running into a Mothbear and then a group of Yellow Shamblers – Ceria couldn’t ever remember the ruins feeling this…empty.</p>
<p>She cleared her throat as Ksmvr stopped on top of a slanted block of stone and scanned the area, shortbow in hands. He looked over at her and Yvlon and Pisces stopped to listen.</p>
<p>“Keep your eyes peeled for monsters. We don’t want anything creeping up on us.”</p>
<p>It probably didn’t need to be said again. Pisces certainly snorted and kept walking. But Yvlon and Ksmvr nodded and moved forwards with even more vigilance.</p>
<p>And then they were at the designated search site. Ceria stared down into a collapsed room and tried to compare the dimensions of the rubble to one of the rooms on the map. It was…a rough fit.</p>
<p>“Looks like we should be able to hit another room if we move a few paces up. See?”</p>
<p>The others crowded around the map, trying to find a good point to break into the supposed secret tunnel. It was supposed to lead out of one of the rooms—residential chambers by the looks of them—into another, larger room. It looked exactly like a secret room, in short, but finding that exact spot would be difficult.</p>
<p>By now of course, the four knew what to do. Yvlon and Ksmvr both grabbed a shovel and chose spots apart from each other before they dug down, hoping to hit a stone roof or other part of the building.</p>
<p>Ceria watched them work, keeping an eye out for danger. Part of her optimistic. The other half—</p>
<p>“We will not find anything this way.”</p>
<p>She looked over to her left. Pisces stood with her, staring at Yvlon and Ksmvr with a disgusted expression on his face. On the first day they’d all taken turns digging until their fingers were blistered. Now the stronger two dug until they thought they’d found something, in which case Pisces and Ceria would pitch in.</p>
<p>“You do realize how deep the secret rooms could be?”</p>
<p>“I know. Normally we’d have hired a digging team, we’d have twice as many adventurers and maybe even joined another team. But we don’t have the time for that—and any other group would demand equal shares of the treasure, maybe even try to take it all. And…neither Yvlon nor I have the credibility to persuade anyone to join us, anyways.”</p>
<p>Ceria grimaced. They’d encountered a…bad reception in Esthelm. The other adventurers they’d met had either had words of sympathy or outright contempt and anger for her, but especially Yvlon. All the local adventurers had known someone who’d died in the crypt.</p>
<p>“So instead we have two inexperienced hands and two mages not specialized in earth magic? Hardly better.”</p>
<p>For once, she couldn’t refute his statement. Ceria grimaced.</p>
<p>“We went haring off without a plan. We should have prepared more, planned for this.”</p>
<p>It was the excitement of finding the map. It had overtaken their good sense and made even Ceria and Yvlon ignore their instincts which told them they should have prepared for at least a month and had three times as much coin as they’d borrowed from Erin. But they’d hoped.</p>
<p>Pisces nodded dourly. He had a fresh porridge stain on the neck of his robe.</p>
<p>“I blame myself.”</p>
<p>“Oh, do you really?”</p>
<p>“I should have predicted this outcome. And insisted we use my creations to expedite the process.”</p>
<p>“Pisces. We’ve talked about this.”</p>
<p>“We have. But you have not listened properly as of yet.”</p>
<p>Ceria sighed. She’d gone several rounds with Pisces before, but this time he looked like he had dug his heels in. He was practically impossible to budge in this state.</p>
<p>“You know how Yvlon and I feel about the undead.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“Summoning the dead is a crime up north unless you have an agreement with the local cities—which you don’t.”</p>
<p>“All true.”</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>“Without my undead, we will never dig down deep enough. All we will do is unearth previously found structures like we have all week. You need a tireless workforce; I have the means to create one. All that is getting in the way is your distaste.”</p>
<p>It was a rational argument, delivered in a calm, cool voice. It was so like the old Pisces that Ceria had to glance sideways at him.</p>
<p>Yes. If you looked past the dirty hair and clothing, there were traces of the young man she’d known. Still traces. She wavered.</p>
<p>“Still.”</p>
<p>“Springwalker, I can sense the bodies below us. There’s enough for me to animate several skeletons at least. Probably quite a bit more if need be.”</p>
<p>Pisces looked Ceria in the eye like he used to. His eyes were focused on hers, and he had that old intensity, the old half-manic stare of utter determination in his eyes.</p>
<p>“What is more important, Ceria? Your pride or success here?”</p>
<p>That settled it. Ceria closed her eyes and raised her voice.</p>
<p>“Yvlon!”</p>
<p>When the other adventurer came over Ceria explained Pisces’ point in curt words. Yvlon’s face closed off and she looked at Pisces. He returned the gaze steadily.</p>
<p>“Pisces has a point. We kept unearthing emptied ruins. We might have to go deep and we’re out of time. His undead might be our only shot. What do you think?”</p>
<p>The golden-haired warrior looked unhappy. She hadn’t been overtly hostile towards Pisces on the journey, but then, she hadn’t let him summon any undead either. She pushed some of her dirty hair out of the way.</p>
<p>“You are the Captain, Ceria. If you think it’s worth a shot, I’ll put up with it.”</p>
<p>Her tone and stance made it clear that she did <em>not </em>want Ceria to say yes. But Ceria had already made up her mind.</p>
<p>“Okay, Pisces. Do it.”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded. He stood up and raised his hands. He made no audible gestures, and didn’t showboat. But Ceria sensed his mana gathering and probing down below. She shuddered, knowing what he was looking for.</p>
<p>“Ceria? Is he doing anything…wrong?”</p>
<p>Yvlon’s voice was quiet, but her eyes were intent on the half-Elf’s face. Ceria knew how Yvlon had to feel—it wasn’t like either of them had liked undead before the ruins. And now…</p>
<p>“Nothing wrong, at least magically.”</p>
<p>“And you’re sure this is the only way?”</p>
<p>“The best we have. I don’t like it either. You know that. But it’s his main class, Yvlon. He’s a good mage, but he was always best at his passions. As a [Necromancer], he’s powerful. Let him do this once.”</p>
<p>The former Captain’s lips twisted, but she clearly didn’t want to dispute Ceria’s decision in public. She shook her head and planted the shovel in the dirt.</p>
<p>“I’ll stand watch with Ksmvr. If he’s pulling up the dead, we might as well let them work.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded gratefully, watching as Yvlon picked her way over to Ksmvr. After a few seconds of discussion they walked off to keep a lookout, leaving her with Pisces.</p>
<p>“Rise. Rise from the place where you rest to do my bidding. Claw through stone and dirt to where I stand and obey my orders…”</p>
<p>He was speaking to the earth, his voice lower and audibly infused with the echoing tones of someone casting magic. Ceria shook her head as she sensed the magic leaving him and entering the earth.</p>
<p>“Is that necessary? Can’t you just cast [Raise Dead] and have done with it?”</p>
<p>Pisces shuddered and blinked as he came out of the trance he’d entered to cast the spell. Ceria caught him before he overbalanced and let go immediately. He blinked at her and then nodded once.</p>
<p>It was so…hard sometimes to act normal around him. At least this time Pisces didn’t sniff obnoxiously.</p>
<p>“It’s not that simple when you don’t stick to set spells. You should know that, Ceria. I told you, if you cast a spell the same way each time, you don’t learn anything.”</p>
<p>“Fine. So you improvised. I assume you cast multiple raise dead spells at range?”</p>
<p>“[Raise Skeleton], in point of fact. They are the most cost-effective, or so I’ve found.”</p>
<p>“Oh good.”</p>
<p>Pisces pointed at an area of ground ahead of them.</p>
<p>“There is a considerable group of dead bodies below us. That might indicate a secret room is indeed down there.”</p>
<p>“It might mean it’s already been looted.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps. Or that it was found but never successfully entered. Either way, I have summoned several skeletons that will assist with the digging.”</p>
<p>Ceria stared at the ground. She didn’t see the normal tremors of dirt or hands clawing their way out of the soil that preceded a zombie bursting out to try and eat her face off.</p>
<p>“Something taking them a while? Or did you just tell them to take it easy?”</p>
<p>Pisces scowled at the needling, and Ceria immediately regretted the words. It had been a powerful spell; she could see him sweating a bit in the cold.</p>
<p>“They must find their way up from a considerable distance. A shame you couldn’t remember where the Lich was, Springwalker.”</p>
<p>“You can’t animate a Lich, Pisces.”</p>
<p>“Maybe not from scratch. But if I had the bones of one—”</p>
<p>“You could animate it? Really?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps. I should like to study the spell animating it at least.”</p>
<p>The half-Elf eyed her once friend as he mumbled to himself. He thought he could create a Lich? Or learn the spell to make one?</p>
<p>That was…concerning. A Lich wasn’t the highest-level undead; not by far. But it was powerful. Powerful enough that if Pisces could animate one by himself, he was stronger than Ceria had given him credit for.</p>
<p>“What level <em>are </em>you by now? In your [Necromancer] class, I mean.”</p>
<p>The mage stopped muttering to himself. He turned to stare flatly at Ceria.</p>
<p>“What do you care? Didn’t you tell me last time we parted ways that you never wanted to hear from me again?”</p>
<p>“That was then. Somehow we’ve ended up working together again.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I suppose I should thank Erin Solstice for that.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you should. Or will you curse her for it?”</p>
<p>“<em>I</em> had no objections to working with you, Springwalker. But you were the one who told me you didn’t want to travel with me.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I did.”</p>
<p>Ceria dearly wished she used a staff like Sostrom used to carry around. True, it was cumbersome, but it would have been so nice to lean on. She contented herself with sitting on a rock.</p>
<p>“I haven’t exactly changed my opinion of necromancy since then. You do know that the undead killed my team, and Yvlon’s? I saw a lot of friends die thanks to them.”</p>
<p>Pisces just shook his head.</p>
<p>“The undead are mindless. Or rather, most are. The ones under my command are not the same as those roving creatures.”</p>
<p>“Some would say there’s not a lot of difference. If you lose control or get killed, they’re still mindless.”</p>
<p>“Only if I don’t realize my goals.”</p>
<p>“Still going on about that? I’d have thought you gave up by now. You certainly don’t seem to have made much progress.”</p>
<p>To her surprise, Pisces grinned rather than grow defensive at her jibe. That made her cautious. But he glanced over at the ground and she heard the sounds of dirt scattering. The first of the skeletons was digging itself out of the ground.</p>
<p>“Oh good. The diggers are here. Get them to work, will you?”</p>
<p>Both Yvlon and Ksmvr watched from their posts as five more skeletons dug themselves out to join the one Pisces had summoned. Two grabbed shovels; the others just got to digging in the earth with their bare hands.</p>
<p>Yvlon turned away as the skeletons with glowing eyes started working. Ksmvr just watched with interest. Ceria took a seat on a rock next to Pisces as they chatted in the cold.</p>
<p>“It seems odd that Ksmvr wouldn’t be a better digger.”</p>
<p>“He was not built for it, Springwalker. He may share the same body, but he clearly lacks the experience.”</p>
<p>“All things to their intended purpose, eh? Surprised to hear <em>you</em> of all people say that.”</p>
<p>“I am not suggesting it is effective. I am simply stating what is. Do not misconstrue my words.”</p>
<p>“…Sorry.”</p>
<p>They sat in silence for a while, watching as the skeletons got to work. They moved with commendable speed in the cold, and despite being weaker than Ksmvr and Yvlon, they were tireless. Ceria already wondered why they hadn’t used them earlier, until she remembered exactly why.</p>
<p>“They look like they’ll get a good way down before the day’s over. Maybe this will work.”</p>
<p>“One can only hope.”</p>
<p>Pisces grunted as he stared at his creations. His stomach growled audibly in the wind. As if in answer, Ceria’s did likewise.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it funny? A few years ago we’d be in the banquet hall, stuffing our faces over a book of spells.”</p>
<p>“True.”</p>
<p>“…Do you miss it?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>His voice was soft. Pisces stared at his undead, remembering just like she was.</p>
<p>“But it is the past. I gave it up for my passions. There is no use looking back.”</p>
<p>“To you, maybe. I wonder what would have happened if—you were a better mage once, when you didn’t practice Necromancy.”</p>
<p>The words were still bitter and from a dark place inside Ceria. But she couldn’t help them coming out. This time Pisces didn’t snap at her. He just shrugged tiredly.</p>
<p>“Some thought so. But I was a generalist then; a jack of no masteries. Necromancy was ever my passion. I might have had the dregs of popular support, but only that. Who would applaud a mage without a master or a calling?”</p>
<p>“<em>I </em>respected you. So did Mons and a lot of other people.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>There wasn’t anything he could say to that. Pisces stared at the flying dirt and two skeletons trying to lift a large stone out of a hole they’d dug.</p>
<p>“Mons. Yes. What happened to her? I didn’t hear of another mage joining you when you left Wistram. Did she…?”</p>
<p>“She kept studying in Wistram. Who knows? By now she might be a better [Mage] than you or I.”</p>
<p>“Hah. Perhaps. She certainly knows more spells by now at least.”</p>
<p>They both laughed at that. Then they grew silent. Ceria could sense what was coming, but her tongue kept leading her onwards.</p>
<p>“You know, even if you had become a [Necromancer], it might have all been okay if you hadn’t…”</p>
<p>“I told you, it was to a purpose.”</p>
<p>“But you didn’t even ask permission.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t need it. Cognita said as much. The rules they made—”</p>
<p>“It’s the principle of the thing, Pisces. You spat in their faces and said—”</p>
<p>The other mage cut her off. His face was tight and drawn, and Ceria knew he was reliving the same moment, just like her.</p>
<p>“I…erred. But I did what I thought was best. It is the past, now. Continuing the same argument would be pointless. You fail to understand my position as you have in the past.”</p>
<p>“I guess so. But you have to admit, it didn’t end like you’d hoped.”</p>
<p>“No. It didn’t. I realize that now.”</p>
<p>It was the first time she’d ever heard him admit he’d been wrong. Ceria looked at Pisces in surprise.</p>
<p>“You do?”</p>
<p>Shrug.</p>
<p>“Recent events have given me cause to…regret the ending. That is all.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Yeah. Neither of us are exactly earning Wistram rates, are we?”</p>
<p>“No. But I was astounded to receive a message from you. I didn’t even know you were still on the same continent. What made you decide to come here?”</p>
<p>“I came to Izril to earn money. To become a better adventurer, since I couldn’t stay in Wistram.”</p>
<p>“Why not Baleros or Chandrar?”</p>
<p>“Too far and too violent. For both, really. I didn’t want to join a Company; I wanted to make my own choices.”</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>Ceria looked sideways at Pisces.</p>
<p>“What about you? Why did you decide to become an adventurer? Didn’t you swear to me you’d pursue your own path?”</p>
<p>“I…need to be a higher level. That’s all.”</p>
<p>“Really? But you won’t level up that much from just casting mage spells.”</p>
<p>“True. But…well, perhaps I’m also looking for something else.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“One last chance.”</p>
<p>“For what?”</p>
<p>He hesitated. Pisces stared at the ground, as the cold wind blew his robes around him.</p>
<p>“To—”</p>
<p>Below them in the ditch they’d hollowed out, one of the skeletons raised its shovel and brought it down on a section of ground. The earth around it collapsed, and the undead disappeared.</p>
<p>The earth rumbled as dirt and stone shifted. Instantly, Ceria and Pisces stepped back, feeling the ground under their feet <em>shift</em> slightly.</p>
<p>“<em>Collapse!</em> Get clear!”</p>
<p>Ceria shouted to Yvlon and Ksmvr as the tremors grew. She stumbled back, looking for safe ground, grabbing Pisces as he tripped after her.</p>
<p>Collapses were a big danger in older dungeons and in places like this. It was all too possible to be swallowed by the earth. Ceria saw Yvlon and Ksmvr running to a large section of stone, hoping to find a safe place on the solid rock. She tried to run after them.</p>
<p>And then, as soon as the horrible rumbling had started, it stopped. Ceria turned shakily and found Pisces getting to his feet. He brushed dirt off of his robes and then turned to stare as well.</p>
<p>“Tree rot. Look at that.”</p>
<p>A huge gaping sinkhole had opened up where the skeletons had been. Ceria could spot two climbing up, but not the other four.</p>
<p>“Trap spell! Get down!”</p>
<p>Pisces shouted it and Ceria immediately dove back into the soil. She saw Yvlon and Ksmvr who’d been running over to them do the same. She turned to look and saw what had alarmed Pisces.</p>
<p>Giant ribbons of flame that writhed and twisted around like snakes were burning around the fallen dirt and stone. The flames weren’t red and orange; these were <em>blue</em>, and already they were melting stone and turning the dirt into smoke that began to billow up from the hole.</p>
<p>“Pisces. Is it aimed at—?”</p>
<p>“No. Let me see.”</p>
<p>The other mage raised his face out of the dirt and focused. Two of his skeletons approached the pit.</p>
<p>“I’ve lost three of my skeletons. Two were incinerated; the other crushed. Last one’s trapped under some dirt. The other two aren’t being targeted—looks like we set off an area trap.”</p>
<p>“Thank flowers for that.”</p>
<p>Ceria sighed and let some of the tension ease out of her body. She’d hoped for something to happen, but she hadn’t expected <em>that.</em></p>
<p>“We just dug straight into that secret corridor, didn’t we? And by the looks of it, it leads to a [Mage]’s quarters.”</p>
<p>“Looks like it.”</p>
<p>For a second the two mages stared down at the dancing flames. Ceria was already trying to analyze the spell; the amount of mana she could sense in the flames and the way they were instantly burning through the huge amount of stone and dirt in the way told her that it was a seriously powerful spell they’d tripped down there. What Tier? Tier 5? 6?</p>
<p>“Ceria! Pisces! Are you two alright?”</p>
<p>Yvlon’s voice echoed and Ceria realized she and Ksmvr probably couldn’t see what she did. She scrambled to her feet and waved her hand at the two prone forms that were slowly crawling towards them.</p>
<p>“It’s fine! The skeletons broke through the roof of a new area! The falling stones must have set off some of the magical protections. Stay clear, everyone!”</p>
<p>Yvlon and Ksmvr got to their feet. They made their way over to Pisces and Ceria as the two tried to dust themselves off.</p>
<p>“We just heard the rumbling when the earth began to collapse. Good thing we weren’t standing closer.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. That would have most likely resulted in our painful immolation.”</p>
<p>Both humans and the half-Elf fell silent as they stared at Ksmvr. He stared back.</p>
<p>“Unless Pisces or Ceria know powerful anti-flame spells?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Nope.”</p>
<p>“You’re probably right, Ksmvr. Thank you for sharing that.”</p>
<p>All four adventurers turned their attention back to the pit. Yvlon whistled.</p>
<p>“Those flames are still going? That must be some trap spell. Who were they expecting to kill? Named Adventurers?”</p>
<p>“Ah. It—”</p>
<p>“It’s probably—”</p>
<p>Ceria and Pisces broke off. Both of them had spoken at once. They shared a look and then Ceria explained.</p>
<p>“We hit the binding matrix of the spell. That’s why it’s still going. All the mana is being depleted and it’s not going to recharge after it’s over.”</p>
<p>“Oh. I see.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr looked down into the pit.</p>
<p>“May I ask what the nature of this spell is? It appears to be mainly aimed at close-range magic. Is there any unusual component to it?”</p>
<p>That was what Ceria had been trying to figure out. She rubbed at her chin.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure. That’s some kind of pyromancy trap for sure. But blue flames? It looks like a variation of that [Flame Snake] spell we read about, remember?”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded absently.</p>
<p>“An upgraded version. Clearly evident from the blue flames and extreme heat.”</p>
<p>“Clearly. Probably be practically impossible to block if it suddenly came at us.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. The walls were probably reinforced to avoid sudden escape. Would a trap wall have blocked any retreat?”</p>
<p>“Maybe…”</p>
<p>Yvlon looked at the two mages.</p>
<p>“What’s the verdict?”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded.</p>
<p>“Good. That’s a powerful spell. And it was fresh. No one’s triggered it before or we’d see the scorch marks. There’s a good chance no one’s explored this place before. And best yet—”</p>
<p>“What they’re guarding could be just as valuable.”</p>
<p>Pisces smiled, and so did Yvlon. Ksmvr just moved his jaws slightly.</p>
<p>“This is good, correct? Should we descend once the flames have ceased?”</p>
<p>“Definitely. Get ready everyone! We’re going in!”</p>
<p>Suddenly energized, Ceria began calling more mana into her skeletal hand as she reviewed spells. Yvlon put on a helmet and began swinging her sword lightly. Ksmvr armed himself with the shortsword and knife for close-quarters combat. Pisces recalled his two skeletons.</p>
<p>The mood of the group had completely changed in a few seconds. The pressure of imminent death—but more importantly, the thought that they might have found something truly important—had given them the same burning hope they’d had at the beginning. Ceria could barely contain her eagerness as they waited for the spell to end.</p>
<p>“Don’t go in for at least thirty minutes after the fires have stopped. The heat down there is intense.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the smoking stones were radiating an intense heat that completely ignored the cold air. Ceria was already starting to warm up even far as she was from the sinkhole. Pisces stared down at the entrance to the tunnel, barely able to conceal his excitement.</p>
<p>“I could cast [Frozen Wind] to expedite the cooling process.”</p>
<p>“Save your mana. We don’t know what’s down there. In fact—let’s get started on the trap dummy. I was going to use the mud ball method, but why not one of your skeletons.”</p>
<p>“Right. Let’s.”</p>
<p>Even Yvlon didn’t object as Ceria and Pisces got to work on one of the skeletons. Only Ksmvr was confused. He stared at the two mages as they started handing the skeleton items and muttering about enchantments.</p>
<p>“Excuse me. What is happening?”</p>
<p>Ceria paused as she handed the skeleton a hefty rock to hold. Pisces was busy with a torch he was trying to light.</p>
<p>“Oh. You’ve never seen adventurers entering a trapped dungeon, have you, Ksmvr?”</p>
<p>“No. What is the purpose of equipping the skeleton thusly?”</p>
<p>This time it was Yvlon who explained. She gestured at the skeleton as Ceria cast an enchantment over it. A ball of light hovered around the skeleton’s head, radiating light that added to the flame of the torch in its other hand.</p>
<p>“When we go into dungeons, we’re always wary of traps. They claim more lives than monsters most of the time. If we had a [Rogue] or [Scout] we could rely on their trap-sensing Skills but we don’t have one. And even then, it’s extremely risky for anyone who goes in first. Most of the adventurers who take point—don’t survive.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded grimly. She’d buried more friends than she cared to remember who’d gone in and received the business end of a trap or monster’s claw. Yvlon had the same expression as she continued.</p>
<p>“So. We find ways to trigger traps beforehand. One common way is to shoot an arrow at an obvious tripwire or pressure plate, but a lot of traps are magical. So adventurers will roll something down a suspicious corridor—we use mud balls if we can’t use anything else. But a lot of traps have more sophisticated sensors.”</p>
<p>“Hence using the undead. They might not trip detection for living beings, but by giving them a heat source and the weight of a normal adventurer, this one will probably trigger most traps. And the magical enchantment also activates a lot of sensors.”</p>
<p>Pisces explained as he made the skeleton walk towards the edge of the unearthed corridor. Ceria nodded.</p>
<p>“Hopefully we’re not dealing with an experienced trap maker. If this is a mage’s personal quarters—well, they’re pretty bad at differentiating the activation mechanism for spells. We might get all the traps this way.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me. I am confused once again. I thought this was a dungeon. What was this about a personal mage’s quarters?”</p>
<p>“It’s…hard to explain, Ksmvr. We say ‘dungeon’, but that doesn’t mean this place was originally built underground. I think Albez was actually a city that sunk into the ground over thousands of years.”</p>
<p>“Oh. I see.”</p>
<p>The Antinium considered this.</p>
<p>“So we are, in fact, likely breaking into a deceased individual’s personal quarters?”</p>
<p>Ceria, Pisces, and Yvlon looked at each other.</p>
<p>“Pretty much.”</p>
<p>“Hopefully.”</p>
<p>“Or a treasury owned by a guild or rich person. Those are always nice.”</p>
<p>“Then why all the traps? The spell we just witnessed seemed excessive?”</p>
<p>Ceria shrugged.</p>
<p>“Paranoia. It’s usually because people have something important they don’t want stolen. And a powerful mage around Level 50? They’d have a lot of enemies, a lot of artifacts and valuables over the years. Their homes tend to turn into miniature gauntlets by the time they die.”</p>
<p>Yvlon nodded.</p>
<p>“In some cases, the protections are justified. Consider what powerful items a mage might own? On the other hand, artificial dungeons—ones that people make for the exclusive purpose of guarding something really rare—are the worst. This is more like a few private wards on a home. But dungeons designed to kill a huge number of invaders? Those are real deathtraps.”</p>
<p>“Indeed? How so?”</p>
<p>Ksmvr barely had to get the others started. Even Pisces had stories of the horrors adventurers had found in ruins.</p>
<p>“I heard in one dungeon the creators placed an invisible poison mist trap at the entrance. So while the adventurers were clearing the dungeon they were slowly dying. Hundreds of teams would go in without problems, but none ever came out.”</p>
<p>“What about the acid showers? Did you hear about that? It triggered five hundred meters in and flooded each corridor. If it didn’t have such a long reset time it would have wiped every team that went in there.”</p>
<p>“I heard of one mage who just teleported the people in the trap into a pit in the middle of bedrock. They had no way out and they’d just starve to death.”</p>
<p>“I heard of that one too! The [Miners] who eventually located the trap—didn’t they find some adventurers still alive in there? They’d eaten all their friends and were living off their boots.”</p>
<p>“That’s just a myth. No one would have the air to survive down there.”</p>
<p>“I heard they had a charm.”</p>
<p>“True, but even so—”</p>
<p>Bemused, Ksmvr glanced around at the others.</p>
<p>“You seem unusually upbeat for such a dire circumstance we might be facing ourselves.”</p>
<p>“That’s part of what being an adventurer is, Ksmvr. We risk everything, so we might as well chuckle a bit in case the worst does come true.”</p>
<p>Ceria laughed. Even Yvlon grinned at the Antinium.</p>
<p>“We’re building morale before we enter. Don’t worry—we’re all nervous. But it’s better to tell jokes than to wait in silence.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr considered this, and then nodded.</p>
<p>“I shall learn from this experience. Thank you for explaining it to me.”</p>
<p>That was weird, but it just made the others laugh harder. Because it <em>was</em> weird and they were about to enter a place where they might die. Soon, Ceria judged the hole to be cool enough to enter, and after sending the skeleton in first, the others slid down the melted rock and entered the abandoned tunnel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Okay, that was a nasty arrow trap. Pisces, you’re walking in front from now on.”</p>
<p>Ceria eyed the deadly poison-tipped bolt that had neatly passed through the skeleton’s ribs and shattered on the far wall. She didn’t even want to touch the arrow in case all of it was toxic.</p>
<p>Pisces shook his head. He pointed and the skeleton obediently trotted forwards again.</p>
<p>“I will stay behind the two warriors, thank you. They have armor. I do not.”</p>
<p>“You have that ring. It probably would have saved your life.”</p>
<p>Ceria watched as the skeleton advanced fifteen more paces into the darkness and rounded a bend. The tunnel they’d found was long and winding and this was the second trap they’d run into. The first one had been an easily-triggered trap that had unleashed the dreaded spray of acid when Ksmvr had fired an arrow at it. The second the skeleton had triggered and Ceria was only concerned there might be more.</p>
<p>Several hours had passed since the Horns of Hammerad had entered the tunnel. Despite that, they’d gone less than eighty paces. This was due to the excruciating care all four were taking to check for traps every inch of the way.</p>
<p>All of them had long sticks they used to poke at the wall, ceiling, and floor, and Pisces regularly sent his other two skeletons ahead to stomp or bang on walls in hopes of triggering something. Even when they thought it was safe, the Horns of Hammerad went in line, one at a time, letting Ksmvr or Yvlon go forwards a good ways before the others cautiously caught up.</p>
<p>“The tunnel can’t be that much longer. The map shows it leading to a good-sized space ahead, right?”</p>
<p>Ceria didn’t even have to look at the map in her pack. She nodded.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Hopefully we get there by tonight. Otherwise…we could set up camp there.”</p>
<p>Again, it was Yvlon who had the calm acceptance of this fact; she’d probably expected that to begin with, and Ksmvr who deferred instantly to her leadership. But Pisces scowled.</p>
<p>“Camp <em>here?</em> But this corridor is wide open! We should endeavor to get to the end before nightfall—I don’t want a monster cornering us in here.”</p>
<p>“Better that than rushing, Pisces.”</p>
<p>The scowl Ceria gave Pisces was returned with equal value. She hated how he balked at every decision she made. She knew he was eager—she remembered the same feeling and even the same conversation. But she’d seen what happened when they rushed.</p>
<p>Pisces <em>clicked </em>his teeth together as Ceria replied.</p>
<p>“We don’t risk anything. Even if it means two days—even if we had to leave this place and come back with supplies rather than risk going in without moving safely, I’d do it. As it is, we’re still way too close to the trap radius if we hit something large. We’re risking a lot as it is, Pisces. I won’t just walk us into death.”</p>
<p>He clicked his teeth together a few more times, clearly upset. But then Pisces sighed.</p>
<p>“Very well. I defer to your experience.”</p>
<p>That surprised Ceria; she’d been sure he would have fought her more on this.</p>
<p>“Really? Good.”</p>
<p>“Yes, well—”</p>
<p>Pisces paused and <em>clicked</em> his teeth again. This time Yvlon scowled at him.</p>
<p>“Would you stop doing that? It’s distracting?”</p>
<p>“Me? I’m not doing that. I thought Ksmvr—”</p>
<p>They all looked at the Antinium. He whirled. His mandibles opened as the <em>clicking</em> suddenly grew louder and they all realized it wasn’t coming from them.</p>
<p>“<em>Attack!</em>”</p>
<p>Something hurtled out of the darkness and knocked the trap-finding skeleton to the ground. Ceria caught a glimpse of whirling scythe-like legs, biting mandibles and pinchers, as she pointed.</p>
<p>“[Ice Spike]!”</p>
<p>She fired the spell at the same time Pisces threw a ball of fire. The spells did not comedically connect and miss—first Ceria’s ice spike blasted into the creature, hurling it backwards, and then Pisces’ flaming ball of magic struck the skeleton. The splatter of flames didn’t touch the creature, but it did illuminate it.</p>
<p>Ceria saw long, almost spider-like legs coated in armor, and a squat, elongated form. But this was no shield-spider. It had too many legs, and barbs on those legs. And it was…dripping. The red and purple carapace and exposed internal organs <em>shifted</em> as the creature opened a maw with rows of circular teeth. It <em>crunched</em> the piece of skeleton it had bit off as more emerged from the darkness.</p>
<p>“Aw hell! <em>Crelers!</em>”</p>
<p>Ceria screamed the words as she pointed at more Crelers. The small creatures scuttled around the corridor, leaping for the adventurers, trying to claw, bite, <em>dig</em> their way through their enemies.</p>
<p>“Cover me!”</p>
<p>Yvlon rushed forwards, sword slicing down at the lead Creler. Her blade battered the creature down, but even her sharp steel could only cut through the exposed organs of the creature. The rest—hard chitin and other bone-like substances—was too strong and the creature tried to scuttle up Yvlon’s leg.</p>
<p>“Perish.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr used his three arms as the other two Crelers came towards him. He grabbed one, ignoring the sharp edges that tore into his hand and began slicing with the other two weapons in his possession. Like Yvlon he couldn’t immediately cut the creature in two, but he had the leverage to slowly pierce the creature’s body with his blades as he sawed at it.</p>
<p>The other Creler tried to jump onto Ksmvr’s back, but Ceria blasted it off with a precise spell. She covered the other two, launching rapid [Ice Spikes] that despite throwing the Crelers back, failed to inflict crucial damage.</p>
<p>“Springwalker! Behind!”</p>
<p>Ceria dove out of the way. Pisces raised his hand, and a gust of icy air froze the Creler that had leapt at him. It fell to the ground, stunned, and a skeleton rushed over. It began to stomp.</p>
<p>All three skeletons were fighting, Ceria saw. They’d grabbed stones and were trying to crush the Crelers to death. But they were almost all blades and sharp edges. You had to have a mace—Calruz had killed most of them himself with his axe!</p>
<p>“Freeze them, Ceria!”</p>
<p>She heard Pisces yell, but then a Creler was jumping at her face. Ceria jerked backwards, and the razor-mouth stopped a foot in front of her face as she seized it with her skeletal hand. Instantly, the Creler tried to bite through her bone and Ceria reacted.</p>
<p>“Die, damn you!”</p>
<p>It wasn’t so much as spell as concentrated ice magic. Instantly, the air around her hand <em>froze</em> and Ceria felt the extreme cold as her skeletal hand froze the Creler in her grasp. It <em>screeched </em>and writhed, but she refused to let go. The monstrosity’s legs and claws waved about, threatening to score her flesh even as she held it far away as possible. But after five seconds it stiffened up and died, frozen to death in her grasp.</p>
<p>Shaking, Ceria let go. But she didn’t have time to wait. She spun and began blasting the Crelers trying to swarm Yvlon’s armor. The other woman took the impacts as [Ice Spikes] deflected off her armor—she hurled a Creler to the ground and stepped on it to an accompanying shriek.</p>
<p>Ceria ran forwards and blasted a Creler with an [Ice Spike] dead on. This time the force of the impact <em>broke </em>the creature; it collapsed, several legs breaking off its body as yellow slime exited the wounds. Ceria shuddered and spun, searching for another target.</p>
<p>In another second it was over. Pisces threw fire onto the last Creler being held down by his skeletons and Ksmvr finished smashing the second one with his enchanted iron blade. The Crelers twitched and made bubbling sounds where they lay, but they were too far dead to move.</p>
<p>Ceria stumbled backwards, gasping as sweat poured down her face and the exertion of using so much magic caught up with her. She grabbed onto Yvlon and the other woman stumbled.</p>
<p>“Yvlon. Did they get you?”</p>
<p>The golden-haired Captain was also gasping for air, but she shook her head.</p>
<p>“They didn’t get into my head. Think some cut into my breastplate, but didn’t get my skin.”</p>
<p>“Sorry about the [Ice Spikes]. Did I hurt you or pierce your armor?”</p>
<p>“A few dents. I’m okay. Thanks.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded. She could have pierced Yvlon’s armor and killed her if the [Ice Spike] spells had been at closer range or hit a weak joint. But better that then let a Creler at Yvlon’s exposed head. It would have chewed its way into her armor through the stump of her neck in second.</p>
<p>“Well, that explains why we haven’t run into more monsters or undead recently. Crelers.”</p>
<p>“Dead gods.”</p>
<p>The two women looked over at Ksmvr and Pisces. Pisces was unharmed, if pale and shaken, but Ksmvr had been wounded. They went over to look.</p>
<p>“It is nothing. My hand is lacerated in several places, but Pisces has bound the injuries. It will heal.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>Ceria peered at the already green-stained bandage Pisces had wound around Ksmvr’s hand. The Antinium nodded.</p>
<p>“I am fine.”</p>
<p>“Crelers have toxins in their bites and claws—”</p>
<p>“It will not affect me. Thank you for the concern.”</p>
<p>“Dead gods, Ksmvr! I’ve never seen anyone <em>hold</em> a Creler down to kill it! Are you insane?”</p>
<p>“I just fought as the Antinium do against them. I am relieved they were only small.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Yeah. Pisces, you alright?”</p>
<p>“I—I hate those things.”</p>
<p>Pisces shuddered as he stared at a twitching Creler. Ceria nodded. So did Yvlon. And Ksmvr.</p>
<p>“Dead gods. Crelers. Just imagine if there had been a few more—”</p>
<p>“Those skeletons saved us. The Crelers went for us, but they held them away. Got chewed up. Look at that one—”</p>
<p>“Shh. Shh. Are there any more around?”</p>
<p>At once everyone fell silent. Ceria listened to her racing heartbeat, but Ksmvr shook his head.</p>
<p>“This group we awakened, but there are no more nearby. But the evidence is clear; there is a nest nearby.”</p>
<p>He indicated the dying Crelers on the ground. A skeleton had seized a rock and was industriously smashing each one to bits.</p>
<p>“These are in their first stage of life. If an adult Creler were in our proximity it would already have attacked. I recommend immediate extermination.”</p>
<p>“Exterminate? A nest?”</p>
<p>Pisces looked at Ksmvr in horror, but the Antinium only nodded. He was deadly focused.</p>
<p>“They are a threat. A menace. If they remain here unchecked, some will grow to adult size. That cannot be allowed to happen.”</p>
<p>Ceria completely agreed, but she didn’t want to be the one to hunt Crelers.</p>
<p>“Normally we get a bounty for reporting them in. Hunting a nest—plague fungus, I don’t want to think about that, Ksmvr. There’s a big bounty on them, true, but—”</p>
<p>“I believe there will not be more than this number. And they would be in their larval form rather than their attack form.”</p>
<p>Yvlon cleaned her blade, staring at a Creler claw that kept twitching.</p>
<p>“Might be doable, Ceria. One good thrust kills them if they’re in their larvae form. We take them by surprise—”</p>
<p>“No! Have you seen what they can do to flesh?”</p>
<p>Pisces was pale, shaking. Ceria looked at him, and then Ksmvr.</p>
<p>“I think Ksmvr’s right, Pisces.”</p>
<p>“<em>What?</em>”</p>
<p>“Do <em>you</em> want a bunch of Crelers at our back if they get hungry or wake up? If we keep going they might hit our backs at the worst moment. We’ve gotta take them out.”</p>
<p>“I—fine. Fine. But the skeletons go first!”</p>
<p>Their group moved on. It took only a few seconds for them to round the corridor and spot the part of the wall that had been tunneled out for Crelers to climb out of. It was a big hole that lead to another naturally forming bubble in the earth. And there they found….</p>
<p>“Dead gods.”</p>
<p>Yvlon whispered it as the four adventurers and three skeletons crept into the heart of a Creler nest. In fairness, it was a tiny one, but Ceria spotted no less than eight Crelers in their larval, incubating stage.</p>
<p>When they weren’t all exposed organs and vicious, lacerating limbs and teeth, Crelers looked like horrible, fat, red caterpillars glowing faintly from within. Inside their semi-translucent ‘skins’, Ceria could see yellow lines and discolored organs moving around within. They were growing. Just as Ksmvr said, if they were allowed a few months and food, they might turn into adults, the nightmares even Gold-rank teams didn’t want to fight.</p>
<p>One of the Crelers was on the wall nearest to Ceria. She edged further into the nest, trying not to move or even breathe. Yvlon tiptoed forwards, face a mask of disgust, sword ready.</p>
<p>The glistening, translucent red sack oozed slowly towards them, drawn by the smell of their meat and blood. Ceria held her breath. Any sudden movement might alert them all. They had to be killed before they could turn themselves inside out and move into the deadly attack form.</p>
<p>She held up three fingers so the others could see and began counting down. Pisces’ skeletons stood at the ready, rocks in hand and Yvlon raised her sword, aiming at the nearest Creler.</p>
<p>“<em>Now!</em>”</p>
<p>Instantly, Ksmvr stabbed two blades into the Crelers he was nearest to. Pisces threw fire at another, screaming curses as Yvlon stabbed hers. The Crelers reacted, making horrible <em>gurbling</em> sound as their fleshy outer red sacs tried to pull back and expose their vicious innards. But it was too late.</p>
<p>In their softer forms they were far weaker to attack. Ceria shot an [Ice Spike] into one Creler and watched blood and its yellowish guts explode inside the balloon of its body. The three skeletons smashed their Crelers with rocks, hammering with feverish frenzy as yellow juices splattered everywhere.</p>
<p>Ultimately, only two managed to transform into their attack modes and they were swiftly smashed by Yvlon’s gauntleted boot and one of Pisces’ skeletons with a rock. Ceria stood with the others, panting as she watched the skeleton repeatedly hammer the twitching Creler until it was in pieces.</p>
<p>“Let’s never do that again.”</p>
<p>Ceria panted as she and the others walked out of the nest. Yvlon and Pisces nodded, and even Ksmvr shuddered a bit as he wiped his blades clean. No one liked fighting Crelers. An underground dungeon full of deadly traps and the possibilities of cave-ins was one thing, but Crelers?</p>
<p>Not Crelers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“That’s the door.”</p>
<p>Ceria whispered it triumphantly as she and the others peeked around the last corner in the tunnel. It felt like forever had passed, but they’d gone no further than twenty paces looking for traps—it seemed time had triggered another one by the smooth melted parts of the wall and scorch marks—and seen the door.</p>
<p>It was a plain, wood door, innocuously set against the frame of the dark stone. Ceria didn’t trust it one bit. It could be an illusion, a trap, any number of things. But upon trying the handle&nbsp;the skeleton had only rattled the doorknob futilely. It had even tried to bash the door in, to no effect.</p>
<p>“Just a magically enchanted door? I’m not buying it.”</p>
<p>“Well, it could be laced with any number of traps. We’ve got to either knock it down or open it some other way. But if we’re in the line of fire—”</p>
<p>“Cast spells at it from range?”</p>
<p>“Could work. My [Ice Spike] spell might do some damage.”</p>
<p>“It’s the best option we’ve got for long distance. Unless you picked up a better spell, Pisces?”</p>
<p>“No. Do it.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded. She poked her finger around the corner as the others moved back, shielding herself against the wall. The trap skeleton watched impassively as it stood next to the door, a casualty to whatever was about to happen.</p>
<p>Okay. [Ice Spike] and then get ready to run if need be. Ceria took a deep breath, and then cast.</p>
<p>“[Ice Spike]!”</p>
<p>The magical dagger of ice shot from her fingertip and <em>broke</em> against the door. Ceria tensed along with the others, but nothing happened. Slowly, they relaxed.</p>
<p>“Maybe just fortifications?”</p>
<p>“Probably. How’s the corridor?”</p>
<p>“Skeleton’s gone over it three times.”</p>
<p>“I volunteer to test it.”</p>
<p>“Ksmvr, don’t be silly—”</p>
<p>“We have been sitting here for an hour. We must try something. Allow me.”</p>
<p>“Wait—”</p>
<p>Yvlon reached for him, but the Antinium stepped out into the corridor. He paused, but no spell came. Slowly, he walked over to the door.</p>
<p>“Nothing. I shall attempt to break it.”</p>
<p>He raised his enchanted sword and stabbed it into the wood. The door resisted the blow, just as it had the [Ice Spike]. And it didn’t trigger a counterspell.</p>
<p>“What is your opinion?”</p>
<p>Ksmvr returned to the others as they conferred. Ceria pulled at her hair, trying to figure out if this was a devilishly clever trap, or just a door made to last forever.</p>
<p>“It might only activate once we break through.”</p>
<p>“Possible, possible.”</p>
<p>“We need to get near, Pisces. We’ll analyze it at close range, and then back away and try from a distance, okay?”</p>
<p>He nodded. Ceria and Pisces exchanged a glance, and then all four Horns of Hammerad crept towards the door.</p>
<p>Nothing happened. They sighed in relief, but Ceria warned Yvlon and Ksmvr.</p>
<p>“Okay, we’re just going to inspect the spell binding the door. If it’s a high-Tier enhancement spell, well, we might have to find another way in. Break through the rock maybe. But don’t touch it until we’re done, okay?”</p>
<p>The other two nodded and readied themselves. Ceria looked at Pisces, and then they reached out and magically inspected the door. Both frowned at around the same time.</p>
<p>“Odd. Look at how delicate this enchantment is, Pisces.”</p>
<p>He nodded as he traced the shimmering symbols and magical currents only they could see.</p>
<p>“Indeed. This is not ordinary reinforcement. There is a trap here. But what’s the trigger?”</p>
<p>The magic shimmered in front of Ceria. Or rather, not shimmered. It was impossible to describe how the magic looked to her with mere words. It was feeling as much as anything else. She delicately looked at the magic, and felt something odd.</p>
<p>“Is it…shifting?”</p>
<p>It was. The stationary spell was moving, reacting. Ceria’s heart immediately skipped a beat and she stood up to back away from the door. Yvlon lifted her shield instantly.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? What’s happening?”</p>
<p>“Oh no. Oh—it’s reacting to us looking at it. <em>Run!</em> <em>Ru—</em>”</p>
<p>She’d just turned when <em>something</em> whined and engulfed her. Ceria blundered forwards, and then <em>crashed</em> into something which broke.</p>
<p>Bones.</p>
<p>A skeleton? Pisces’ creation?</p>
<p>No. Not Pisces’ skeleton. Bones. Piles of bones.</p>
<p>Ceria looked around. They were in a pit. A pit with filth all over the walls. Yvlon, Ksmvr, Pisces—not the skeletons. They looked around, scrambling to get up.</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“We were teleported! A trap! Get ready!”</p>
<p>Ceria whirled around, looking for movement, a deadly spell, a monster, anything. But she saw nothing.</p>
<p>Then something glowed. She turned and saw something on one of the walls. It was…flickering at her. She stared at it. A word? Writing?</p>
<p>No. A magical rune. Ceria instantly tried to look away, but it was too late. She’d already seen it! She tried to close her eyes, but—</p>
<p>“Nothing?”</p>
<p>She stared around. Nothing had happened. She looked over at Ksmvr. He was staring at the magical words. Then he looked at her.</p>
<p>“Ksmvr? Are you okay?”</p>
<p>He hesitated. Then the Antinium nodded. And then he shook his head.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>He paused.</p>
<p>“I—I am an Aberration. No. I am Antinium.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Aberration? Ksmvr?”</p>
<p>He hesitated.</p>
<p>“I—I—I—I—”</p>
<p>He kept repeating the word. Ceria stared at him. Was something wrong? But that was how Ksmvr always acted, wasn’t it? Yes? No?</p>
<p>Why was she talking to an Antinium?</p>
<p>Suddenly, someone grabbed her from behind. Ceria screamed and turned, but it was only Pisces. He stared at her, eyes furious.</p>
<p>“Pisces, what’s wr—”</p>
<p>“<em>What are you doing in bed, boy?</em>”</p>
<p>He screamed the words at her, spittle flying, face red. Ceria jerked backwards, but Pisces had a death-grip on her. He shouted in her ears.</p>
<p>“Fencing practice <em>begins at dawn!</em> Get moving, and I swear, if you shirk I’ll tan your back!”</p>
<p>Something was wrong. Something was right. Ceria knocked Pisces’ hand away and scrambled backwards. She looked around. Yvlon. What was a Yvlon?</p>
<p>“Who are you?”</p>
<p>She was looking down the tip of a sword. A tall, blonde woman stared down at Ceria, chin tilted imperiously upwards as she aimed the sword at Ceria’s nose.</p>
<p>“Explain this uncouth behavior at once. What have you done with me?”</p>
<p>“You? What are you—Yvlon?”</p>
<p>“Ylvon? That is my niece, child. I am Yenelaw Byres, and I <em>demand</em> to know what you have done. What sorcery is this?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I—”</p>
<p>Ceria hesitated. Something was wrong. Something was right. Wrong. Right. When two wrongs make a right, who was the shipwright?</p>
<p>“Get moving!”</p>
<p>Pisces howled at Yvlon, pointing his finger at her. She shifted her sword to him and he danced back, suddenly on guard.</p>
<p>“Oh? Angry, are you? Testing me? You’ll have to do better than that, brat.”</p>
<p>“I am Yennais Bryres. Who, pray, are you?”</p>
<p>“I—I—I—help me—I—I—”</p>
<p>Ksmvr was clutching at his head. Pisces and Yvlon were shouting at the same time. Someone had to do something! Ceria opened her mouth, but then realized something dreadful.</p>
<p><em>I’ve forgotten how to breathe.</em></p>
<p>She had to tell the others. But she couldn’t breathe! Ceria scrabbled at her throat. She’d tear it out! Then she’d be able to breathe through the hole!</p>
<p>Ksmvr stumbled over to her, head in his hands. Her hands?</p>
<p>“i reJEct. aBErRation Is NoT—I am Antinium. I ReFUSE. i—”</p>
<p>Pisces tapped Ceria on the shoulder. She gasped for air and then stared in horror at the man-sized Creler wearing dirty robes.</p>
<p>“Fencing is a noble art, young man. Don’t you agree? Well, we shall see you master the forms or you will go without dinner tonight.”</p>
<p>A butterfly made of steel turned to Ceria and opened its mouth into Erin’s smiling face.</p>
<p>“What am I doing here? Answer me! You there in the frock!”</p>
<p>She had to do something. Stab them! Stab herself! Didn’t she have a skeleton somewhere around here?</p>
<p>Ceria reached for a dagger, but she’d forgotten what her hands were too. She stared at the pulsating flesh-thing on her hand and tried not to scream. Her palm opened up, and little eyes with twig-like legs started crawling out of the hole in her body.</p>
<p>Everything was normal. That was it. Her head twisted—almost of its own volition and stared around the dark room.</p>
<p>What was that on the wall? It had flashed in her mind so quickly she hadn’t had time to read it. As the rest of the world melted away, Ceria saw the shining light again. This time she understood it perfectly.</p>
<p>[Insanity].</p>
<p>The word was insanity, written in magic, pulsating into Ceria’s brain. She smiled at it and then threw up. Her vomit turned into dancing little bugs which tried to eat her until she smashed them with her feet.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>It all made sense.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Some call me a messenger. Others call me a barefoot runner. And crazy. Some call me a deliverer…of messages. A few people know me as [batman]. I think of myself as reasonably sane, but most people disagree. They have a lot of names for someone like me. But the little monster blocking my way just barks.</p>
<p>Dogs. I hate them so much. The mangy dog with off-white fur and brown spots barks again, showing his teeth. There’s a definite growl in his tone—he’s not just warning me, he’s telling me he <em>will</em> attack given an opportunity.</p>
<p>That’s fine. If he goes for me I’m kicking him and damn the consequences. I’ve always wanted to kick a dog. I’m not an animal hater, I’m just a dog hater.</p>
<p>Consider my position. I, Ryoka Griffin, am standing in the snow a few miles out from the lovely city of Celum, holding a small wrapped package in my hands as I face down a dog blocking the way towards a house. It’s not my fault I’m here; I’m on a delivery. And I don’t want to get bitten.</p>
<p>I’ve been bitten by dogs before. Twice, in fact. Both times while I was running. Back home, in my world that is, some people like to think their dogs don’t need a leash. I respect their opinion, and invite them to share it with the local animal control officer. Dogs who aren’t on leashes chase moving objects like me. And they bite.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s just my genetics, or something in me the dogs don’t like. Or maybe it’s because I’m often a sweaty, adrenaline-filled unknown threat invading their perceived personal space at high speed that triggers their instincts to chase and attack. I don’t know. But all I know is that every person who runs hates loose dogs.</p>
<p>Plus, I’m a barefoot runner. That means I’m even more anxious about bites, because I have what is for all intents and purposes, ten bite-sized snacks for a dog to rip off. The same problem goes for my hands, although I only have eight available snacks for a dog to chew on. A Goblin bit two of my fingers off a week ago. Fun story. I’m not keen to repeat it.</p>
<p>The dog barks at me again, and this time growls loudly. I hold still, meeting his eyes as he crouches, hackles bared. He’s in my way. I need to get to that house to deliver my package, but the owner hasn’t come out and I think shouting will make the dog run at me. So. What do I do?</p>
<p>Kick the dog. That’s what about 90% of me wants to do. The other 10% is arguing that the dog is only defending his home and he’s innocent and that I should practice restraint. I’m not inclined to listen to that opinion, but a fight in the snow against a dog isn’t what I want right now. He’s not a big dog; that is to say, not as big as a mastiff or a great dane, but he’s not a poodle either.</p>
<p>He’s just a dog. He deserves mercy.</p>
<p>But I really want to kick a dog. He’s going to try and bite me the instant I move. Kick first, ask questions later.</p>
<p>And if I kick him, I’ll <em>have </em>to hurt him badly which won’t go down well with the owner. Not a good idea.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he, or possibly, she, is in clear violation with my longstanding agreement with nature* and I have no desire to find out if he has rabies. I’m still not sure if healing potions have the ability to cure diseases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*The Ryoka-Nature Accord reads as follows: Get in my way and I will kill and eat you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is how my day starts. On the whole, I’ve had better days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Hark! ‘Tis a mutt and a lying Human-thing!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Girl versus dog! As good as girl versus Dragon! Will there be more riddles?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And my day just got worse. I glance up as I hear the familiar, high-pitched voices from overhead. Spiraling down out of the grey skies overhead, small, winged creatures laugh and point at me and the dog.</p>
<p>I guess you could say they look like small versions of Humans, scaled down, painted blue and given wings. But that would completely, utterly fail to describe these beings. Because they are faeries. The fae. And they cannot be compared to us so easily.</p>
<p>Yes, the Frost Faeries or Winter Sprites as they are known look humanoid. But their bodies are part crystal, part ice. And they have wings, but they are closer to an insect’s set of wings than an angel’s. And in every facet of every line that makes up their beings, they are breathtakingly beautiful.</p>
<p>Not just beautiful; otherworldly. To look at the Frost Faeries is to believe in magic, because that is the whole of what they are. Even as I watch, they fly around me, laughing and speaking in voices that are also part real, and partly immortal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Look, sisters! The dog defends its home!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Let’s eat it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Nae, let us give it a charge! The power to destroy any invaders!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Are there any cats?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They fly around me and the dog, poking, throwing snow into my eyes and raining it on the poor mutt. Oh yeah. I sometimes forget, but the faeries helpfully remind me—immortal wonders they might be, but they’re also annoying as hell.</p>
<p>Only, in this case the faeries’ arrival has an unintended benefit. The dog takes one look at the faeries and runs <em>yipping</em> into the house. I don’t know if he can see the Frost Faeries—they’re pretty much fuzzy blobs to anyone in this world thanks to the magic they wield—but he knows better than to stick around where they can get to them.</p>
<p>I’m not so lucky. The faeries fly around me, laughing, calling me names, teasing me. Some land on my hair which immediately freezes stiff, and others throw snow at my eyes. One drops a frozen beetle on my head.</p>
<p>I think they like me. I’ve experienced them not liking me, and this is still preferable. But it is annoying. I curse and swat at them with my injured hand. The one with three fingers.</p>
<p>“Get lost! I’m working!”</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Ooh! Scary! And what if we don’t?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Yes, threaten us! What would ye do?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The faeries know I can’t back up any threats, so I don’t bother making them. I sigh and take my hand away from my belt. I had been grasping another bottle with my finger on the cork while facing down the dog. If kicking didn’t work I was going to hit it with a potion full of eye-destroying pepper concentrate, although that <em>would</em> have been animal cruelty.</p>
<p>I can hear the dog that fled inside the house barking in fear, and now he pokes his head out the half-open door he first charged out at me from. The faeries throw snow at him and he whines in fear, but, credit where credit is due, he still doesn’t want to leave me alone.</p>
<p>“Barky!”</p>
<p>A young voice shouts from inside the house. The door opens wider, and now a girl runs out. She’s maybe eight or nine, and the dog anxiously runs out after her, circling around her. The girl takes no notice of the faeries, but stares at me.</p>
<p>“Who’re you? Are you trying to hurt Barky?”</p>
<p>Instantly I regret my kicking-dog thoughts. A bit. The little girl stares at me with big, round eyes that creep me out.</p>
<p>“What are you here for?”</p>
<p>“I’m a Runner. Are your parents around?”</p>
<p>“A Runner?”</p>
<p>She looks doubtful, so I reach into my pouch and pull out a small Seal of my own. The magic metal and stone forged into a circle glints as I show it to the girl. It’s proof I’m a City Runner; without it she would be right to be nervous.</p>
<p>“A Runner!”</p>
<p>“That’s right. I have a delivery for your father. Is he here?”</p>
<p>“No—but I have a Seal! I’ll go get it!”</p>
<p>The girl runs inside the house. The dog takes one look at us and runs in after her. The faeries and I wait as I shift from bare foot to foot in the snow. After a few seconds the door opens again and the girl runs out.</p>
<p>“Here, Miss Runner!”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>I hand the package over to the girl. She takes it carefully; it’s bulky and wrapped heavily. I have no idea what’s in it, but at least she won’t drop it.</p>
<p>“Alright then, take care.”</p>
<p>“Goodbye Miss Runner!”</p>
<p>The girl beams at me, and the dog barks. I try to smile; fail. Then she looks at my feet and gasps.</p>
<p>“Aren’t your feet cold?”</p>
<p>I look down at my bare feet. They’re resting in the snow which practically covers them, melting the cold ground, but I barely feel a thing. I grin at her.</p>
<p>“Nope. I’ve got magic feet.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>She gapes at me, and I make tracks before she can ask any questions. The dog barks a few more times as I leave, but I’m willing to give him that. So long as he doesn’t chase after me. I check my shoulders a few more times, but he stays with the girl.</p>
<p>Good dog. The faeries on the other hand aren’t quite so well behaved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Hah! The waif has a loyal dog! Like the king and the Hound of Culann!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“What was that she said? Magic feet?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“How? Where did ye get them, mortal!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Yes, explain! Explain!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They begin jumping up and down on my head as I pick up speed. I try to ignore them.</p>
<p>Despite the cold air and deep snow, I barely feel the chill as I run away from the farmhouse that I was making a delivery to. In the distance, the relatively tall walls of Celum beckon me. It’s just past dawn and I’ve got more deliveries to make. And I’ll make them in record time thanks to—</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Explain!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone pulls at my hair and I grit my teeth.</p>
<p>“Stop that! I don’t have magic feet. I drank some soup, okay? Magic soup.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Oh.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tiny voice on top of my head sounds disappointed. So do the rest of the faeries. I guess magic soup isn’t as cool as magic feet. But then I hear another voice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I want to try some.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Me too!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Give us the soup, Human!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“The soup! The soup!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They begin harassing me again. I try not to pay attention as I run back towards the city.</p>
<p>Magic soup. Yeah.</p>
<p>Did I mention I was in another world?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the dog incident, I make good time running back to Celum. It’s not as if I was that far away from the city, and I only had two more deliveries to make in the outer suburbs.</p>
<p>Fun fact: unlike the Drake cities to the south, Human cities may have walls, but their actual population likes to live outside the walls in lovely suburbs that nestle right up against the walls in some places. It’s that old medieval-style method of building that allows cities to house a much larger population. If monsters attack, people just run inside the walls until they’re gone and rebuild if they have to.</p>
<p>I wonder how well that worked in Esthelm. Given that the entire city was pretty much razed, I’m guessing there might be a teeny flaw in this system.</p>
<p>But it’s not my job to give architectural advice to people. In fact, the only words I speak are when people open their doors.</p>
<p>“Do you know how <em>early </em>it is? Who’re you?”</p>
<p>“I’m a Runner with a delivery. Do you have a Seal?”</p>
<p>“What? You’re a Street Runner?”</p>
<p>“City Runner. I’m doing local deliveries. Do you have a Seal?”</p>
<p>“That’s…quick. Normally we get messages late.”</p>
<p>“So I’ve been told. Your Seal?”</p>
<p>Eventually I get the Seal and hand the letter over to the person at the door and run away. That’s what my job is all about. The talking and dodging dogs—that’s the worst part. I’m just in it for the running.</p>
<p>Too bad everything seems to get in my way. Of course, that’s my unbiased opinion; what could be more important than me delivering letters to people? Guardsmen on patrol? Merchants and farmers with their wagons?</p>
<p>Bah. All of that is less important than the almighty Runner. I dodge and weave around pedestrians, run down less-crowded back alleys and avoid the hell out of any carts rumbling down the wet streets, all the while being followed by my annoying entourage of faeries.</p>
<p>I must admit, for all I hate their fascination with me, they do help clear the crowds. In this world, the Frost Faeries are simply known as strange creatures that help bring the winter each year. Because they can’t be heard and barely be seen by the people here, they’re generally treated like natural hazards to be avoided at all costs.</p>
<p>Too bad I can see them. I’m still not sure why, but that’s led to me striking up an odd relationship up with the faeries. Namely, they annoy me and follow me about hoping I do something entertaining.</p>
<p>Like slip. I windmill my arms, but I still smack hard into the ground. The faeries—and some of the Humans walking by—chuckle, but I get back to my feet without a word and keep running. I swear that ice patch wasn’t there a second ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Did you enjoy your fall? Be more careful next time!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Take care not to slip, Human.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“We tripped you! Hah!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Damn faeries. I keep running, ignoring them as best I can. People give me odd looks if I start talking to the air in any case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Ooh. <em>So</em> busy! Too busy to talk!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the faeries on my head slaps at my head to get my attention. I grit my teeth and ignore her, although it <em>hurts.</em> Then she pulls at my eyelid.</p>
<p>“Screw you! Off!”</p>
<p>I slap at her and she flies away, cheering. I guess getting me to react counts as a win in her books. Another faerie swoops down and flies around my face, obstructing my vision as she laughs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“This mortal is <em>so </em>busy. Not too busy to play a game of riddles, though!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“‘Twas not a fair game, though! She used numbers and lies instead of trickery! Shame!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other faeries jeer and yell at me. I keep a straight face, although the fact that I’m being berated by these obnoxious idiots for playing unfair is hilarious. They’re the most unrepentantly vicious, mischievous, and deceitful creatures I’ve ever met, and those are the qualities I <em>like</em> about them.</p>
<p>The Frost Faeries continue to call me names as I run back into the city proper. I get the sense that despite their obnoxious tone, today they’re a bit more annoyed with me than usual. How do I know? A bit more ice mixed in with the snow they toss on me, and a bit too many pinches and pokes than usual.</p>
<p>Normally the faeries respect—well, they’re equally parts helpful as annoying. Twice as annoying as helpful, but they do have limits. But I think they were disappointed in my game of riddles with Teriarch, the Dragon, a while back.</p>
<p>Yeah. A Dragon. I can barely believe it, but I did meet him. I keep telling myself that, although my only proof is the bag of gold at my side and the book of magic spells. Gods, I still can’t believe I walked away with part of a Dragon’s treasure.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful, magical encounter. But the faeries got mad because instead of having a proper Smeagol vs Bilbo game of riddles, I instead hit Teriarch with logic puzzles from my world. Apparently that doesn’t count and they’re mad about it.</p>
<p>Or something. I finally get rid of the faeries as I go one place they can’t stand: indoors. As I run towards a familiar building, all the faeries <em>hiss</em> and leap off my head. They throw snow at me as I open the door to the Runner’s Guild and slip inside. The building is made with nails of iron and it has iron in general inside; ergo the faeries don’t feel welcome and don’t follow. Their rules are bizarre, but I’m glad they exist.</p>
<p>“Done with the deliveries.”</p>
<p>The [Receptionist] at the counter looks up and gives me a smile which I don’t return. I hand her the Seals I’ve been given and she confirms all my deliveries are done.</p>
<p>“That was quick, Miss Ryoka! I gave them to you just an hour ago, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>I shrug. I was given five different locations. I got to them all, and got the seals. And I did it fast, too.</p>
<p>“Yep. Got any more?”</p>
<p>The [Receptionist] glances awkwardly at the board of deliveries. I look over there too, and notice some other Runners congregated around it. Only one or two today, though.</p>
<p>Normally, longer deliveries are posted on the board – these would be city-to-city runs, the kind I normally do. But there aren’t many requests or many of the better type of Runner that can avoid or outrun bandits and monsters—City Runners—around. That’s because of the Goblins. No one wants to run into them, even if none have been spotted on the roads as of yet.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid we’re all out of Street Runner deliveries. You and the other City Runners—”</p>
<p>I glance over and see where the receptionist is looking. The Runner’s Guild has tables and places to sit, and they’re occupied by an annoyed-looking group of younger Runners. They’re all Street Runners, by the looks of them. They’re not as quick as City Runners, and though they might know the streets well, I and the other city Runners can still beat them in speed. We’ve been cooped up in the city, and so we’ve been poaching all their regular deliveries.</p>
<p>Do I feel bad? No, not really. Running, doing deliveries, it’s all a competition in a way. I run fast, and so I get paid more. Maybe I’d try to give them some work if I intended to stay here for a while, but I think this is my last day of running solely around the city.</p>
<p>I turn back to the receptionist and nod.</p>
<p>“Fine, I’ll come back later. Is Garia Strongheart around?”</p>
<p>“Miss Garia? I haven’t seen her yet. Do you want to leave a message for her?”</p>
<p>“Just tell her I’d like to talk to her if she comes in. That’s all.”</p>
<p>“I will do so. Have a good day, Miss R—”</p>
<p>I’m out the door before the [Receptionist] finishes speaking. Was that rude? Yes, it probably was. She was only trying to do her job, but I didn’t want to exchange pleasantries. It’s a bad habit of mine, and I’ve been getting better recently.</p>
<p>But today? Today’s a bit…frustrating for me. Scratch that, I just woke up so I can’t really say it’s been frustrating as of yet. More like I’ve been having problems for the last few days and today it’s just…</p>
<p>I jog down the streets, keeping an eye out for Frost Faeries. They’re probably bothering someone else right now, but I want to get to my destination before they come back to check on me. Sure enough, I spot the familiar building and push the door open.</p>
<p>Unlike the Runner’s Guild, I hear a babble of voices and find a full house the instant I walk in. Barmaids—three of them—bustle about the room, filling mugs and tankards and serving food to the room full of people eating breakfast.</p>
<p>That’s pretty normal for an inn. But this inn is special, if only because it’s under new management. The evidence of that is clear when I stare at what one of the barmaids is serving to the guests.</p>
<p>“Crepes?”</p>
<p>Yep. They’re crepes alright, complete with sprinkled sugar, and lots of butter. Not any syrup; I guess it’s too expensive for this inn’s budget. But eggs and bacon make this a filling meal—and food choice aside, I can see that each crepe is golden brown and cooked perfectly.</p>
<p>The small inn I’m staying at, the Frenzied Hare, is packed today, just like it was yesterday. Although we’ve only been in the city for a few days, word has gotten around that there’s a new [Innkeeper] who makes great food, and so every day the common room is packed full of people.</p>
<p>Again, thanks to the new management. I’m not sure if she owns the inn, but she acts as if she does and everyone goes along with her because frankly, she’s pulling in money by the bagful. I walk into the kitchen and see the mastermind behind today’s breakfast flipping a crepe into the air. She holds out a plate to catch it, and it splats into the bowl of batter. I block some of the splatter with my hands as she exclaims.</p>
<p>“Ew! I guess [Advanced Cooking] doesn’t help with <em>that.</em>”</p>
<p>She wipes some of the batter off her apron and licks it. Then she looks around and sees me.</p>
<p>“Hey Ryoka! Want a crepe?”</p>
<p>I wipe the batter on my hands and shirt off onto an apron, suddenly realizing that I probably shouldn’t be walking in here with my wet and dirty feet. Oh well.</p>
<p>“I’ll have some food, Erin. Do you want to have breakfast together or have you eaten?”</p>
<p>“Um…I’ve made breakfast, but haven’t eaten. Let me just make one last stack—I think everyone out there is mostly done! I’ll be with you in a bit.”</p>
<p>“Gotcha.”</p>
<p>I walk back out into the inn and try to find an empty table. One of the barmaids who’s name I keep forgetting comes over with a plate of crepes.</p>
<p>“Anything you want to drink, Miss Ryoka? Or is it just hot water again?”</p>
<p>“Hot water. And Erin will probably have milk. She’ll be out in a bit.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be back with your drinks in a second!”</p>
<p>The young woman smiles at me and moves over to another table. I start cutting my crepe apart and eating it. It’s delicious, and the eggs and bacon I manage to get another barmaid to give me are just as good. But my eyes are on the kitchen, and soon enough I see her come out of it.</p>
<p>Erin Solstice. The inn doesn’t exactly stop for her, but somehow she makes her own impression on it. As soon as she comes out she looks towards me. I raise my hand, but she’s intercepted before she even sees me.</p>
<p>The actual owner of the Frenzied Hare, Agnes, has a plate of food in one hand and a huge smile on her face. She’s acting as a barmaid rather than as the innkeeper, but she couldn’t be happier judging by the look on her face as she sits Erin down at a table. She chats animatedly with Erin and other guests come over.</p>
<p>That’s part of Erin’s charm, I guess. She’s friendly, open, and frankly interesting. As an [Innkeeper], I gather she’s quite high-level, especially at her age. You could call her a prodigy without exaggerating, at least by how this world judges things.</p>
<p>Erin has many Skills in the [Innkeeper] class that makes her useful in any inn she walks into, and in a fight. She’s also got great charisma, which is why I finish two plates of food and Erin’s drink of milk before she even finishes her first plate. She’s so busy chatting with Agnes and some other people that I have to wait a few minutes before I can even get her attention.</p>
<p>“Oh, hey Ryoka! Sorry, I must have missed you! Agnes was just telling me I should stay here and help her run the inn forever!”</p>
<p>The woman chuckles as she sits next to Erin, eating the crepes.</p>
<p>“It would be lovely if you would. You’re such a good cook and frankly my dear—you have such a way about you that even Jerom would be jealous of. He’s still so sick—but even when he gets better I could see you being the real manager of the inn. Why, you’re like a second child to me—not that I had a first. I’d so love it if you gave it some thought.”</p>
<p>I roll my eyes as Erin smiles and says something polite and friendly in reply. A second child, sure. One that can do Agnes’ job and her husbands’ without even needing them. Erin is a golden goose and they just want her to stay here and earn them tons of money forever. Even though she’s splitting the profits with Agnes, they have to be earning more in these few days than they would in a month.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m being too harsh. Agnes looks genuinely happy to have Erin here, and so do the other people. But I’m not going to wait until they finish their chat about banal things. I clear my throat.</p>
<p>“Erin. Do you have a minute?”</p>
<p>She looks up at me and nods, while the others look disappointed.</p>
<p>“Sure, Ryoka! Let me just eat one last crepe…mm, this is good! You want another?”</p>
<p>I shake my head and wait until Erin finishes stuffing her face. Of course, that doesn’t mean she and I get to talk right away. Agnes, hovers around while Erin chats with her…and then some of her guests…and then finally has time to talk with me at a table in the corner.</p>
<p>“What’s up, Ryoka? Did you finish your deliveries?”</p>
<p>“A while ago. But I was thinking today you and I should do more planning. We still need to get you back.”</p>
<p>Erin’s smile, present on her face since the moment I saw her today, fades. She looks at me seriously.</p>
<p>“Right. We still need to get back. But didn’t you say that was dangerous? You told me yesterday that leaving wasn’t a good idea.”</p>
<p>I nod. Erin and I are in Celum, a Human city on the continent of Izril. And while we’re surviving well enough here, this isn’t where Erin belongs. She needs to go back to Liscor, a city a hundred miles south of here, and that is an undertaking which has been bothering me since I found her here.</p>
<p>“Right, leaving earlier wasn’t a good option. The gates were locked for the first day, and we were still getting word of what happened yesterday. But there aren’t any reports of large Goblin groups on the move today, so if we’re going to look into getting you back to Liscor, we should start now.”</p>
<p>Liscor is Erin’s home. At least, that’s where her inn is. And her friends. She belongs there, in a sense, and both she and I know it, no matter how much she might enjoy being here.</p>
<p>Erin frowns as she nods and drinks from her cup of warm milk.</p>
<p>“I want to go back, Ryoka, I really do. I know Mrsha must be so worried! But Selys can take care of her, and I really do want to finish up my experiments with Octavia first.”</p>
<p>I frown at Erin. She keeps saying she wants to finish her experiments, but over the three days we’ve been here, she’s gone to the [Alchemist]’s shop nearly every day.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you done yet? Or can’t you finish your work in Liscor?”</p>
<p>“Maybe…but I need Octavia’s help, Ryoka! She knows all kinds of rare alchemical stuff and she helps me with the food.”</p>
<p>Magical food. Only Erin would think of it. But it works—she made a soup that can give me partial immunity to the cold. I clench my teeth as I think.</p>
<p>“If I had to choose between you going now or later…there are [Alchemists] in Liscor, I’m sure, Erin. And maybe we could get Octavia to come with you? She’d do anything for gold.”</p>
<p>“Maybe.”</p>
<p>“Either way, I want to know that we can get you back, so I wanted to visit places with you if you’ve got time before you go to Octavia’s. There’s a market full of magical items—I want to see if there’s anything you or I could use in case we got attacked on the road—and the Adventurer’s Guild might have a party we could hire to escort us back.”</p>
<p>Erin’s eyes light up at the sound of magical items. She’s still not over magic existing in this world, and neither am I, in truth. She nods eagerly as she finishes her drink.</p>
<p>“I’d love to come along! Agnes says she can handle lunch, so as long as I’m back for dinner—I’m sure Octavia wouldn’t mind if I came by an hour or two late.”</p>
<p>I’m sure she wouldn’t. I nod briskly as Erin waves at Agnes to let her know.</p>
<p>“Fine. First we go shopping, then we’ll ask about an escort and visit Octavia. Sound good?”</p>
<p>“Great!”</p>
<p>“Oh, and by the way, the Frost Faeries are back.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Um…”</p>
<p>It takes us a while to leave the inn, but by the time we do, thirty more minutes have passed, and the faeries are waiting for us as we leave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Oh look! It’s the duo! The food maker and the story teller!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Let’s hit them with snow!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Nae, let’s demand food and a story!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Erin blinks up at the faeries as I groan. The other guests that came out to talk and socialize with Erin immediately decide to go back in as the tiny faeries begin swirling around us again, pulling at hair, laughing, conjuring snow—</p>
<p>“Hey, do you all want a crepe?”</p>
<p>They blink. I blink. But the steaming crepe is in Erin’s hands and she tosses it up to them. Immediately, all the faeries begin to fight over it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Give it to me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“No, me!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an instant the crepe is whirled up into the air and bits of it fall down as the faeries fight and devour it, ripping head-sized chunks away and gobbling them down like starving…ladybugs. Well, they’re bigger than ladybugs by a good bit, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>While they’re fighting, Erin and I walk off. I see the door open behind us, and to my surprise, a plate heaping with steamed crepes is placed outside. I see Agnes waving at Erin before she closes the door and the faeries descend on the food.</p>
<p>I stare at Erin as she smiles, walking beside me.</p>
<p>“Did you plan that?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, they like food!”</p>
<p>Why didn’t I think of—I walk along with Erin, shaking my head slightly. Bribe the faeries with crepes. It’s so obvious, and so easy!</p>
<p>That’s the thing about Erin. It’s never boring when I’m with her. In fact, she might have an even crazier life than I do at times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“So, all of these things are magical?”</p>
<p>Erin and I stand in what I can only call a cross between a flea market and a shopping street, staring at a merchant as he displays a small selection of old-looking rings, amulets, and even a few neatly tied scrolls.</p>
<p>Like all markets, supply is often matched by demand, which is why finding anyone who sells magical items in Celum is actually a harder task than it might seem. There are very few shops that do permanent trade in solely magical items, and most such merchants roam from city to city to find their clientele.</p>
<p>Erin and I were lucky enough to be pointed towards this [Merchant], a man of good repute who offers lower-grade magical items. He’s a richly dressed man wearing countless rings and jewelry that sparkles and gives the impression of magic—although I doubt the rings do much more than emit pretty colors. The effect is nice, though, and the man himself is quite the salesman, trying to get Erin or I to commit to a purchase.</p>
<p>Frankly, I’m not sure I’ll buy anything today. I’ve got Octavia’s potions which are quite useful, and I don’t have any glaring needs for magical artifacts right now. I’m just browsing. Also, from what I understand of how much any kind of enchanted object costs, I can only afford a very basic item even with the eight hundred gold pieces I received from Teriarch.</p>
<p>The man sits on a small wooden chair, watching us with a smile on his face while his two guards watch us and everyone coming near the display with considerably less cheer. Erin stares with fascination at the rings; they just look old and uninteresting to me, except for one ring that’s visibly sparkling with red light. I guess most magical items are designed not to attract attention.</p>
<p>“Ladies, what would you two like to buy? I have quite a small selection today—I was cleaned out a while back, but I believe I have a number of trinkets that could help you with all your needs. In fact, I even have a little potion for romantic—”</p>
<p>“We’re not shopping for love potions. I’m looking for protection.”</p>
<p>I don’t want to know if there are actual love potions in this world. The man blinks at me.</p>
<p>“Protection? Unless you need a weapon—no. Are you a Runner?”</p>
<p>“Well observed.”</p>
<p>I lift one bare foot. The [Merchant] is eying my un-frostbitten toes, and I can tell he wants to ask about them.</p>
<p>“I’m looking for a ring of protection or something similar. Anything that can help me survive a run-in with monsters or bandits.”</p>
<p>The man smiles thinly at me, and from the way the two guards shift, I can tell they’re amused as well.</p>
<p>“Ah, I’m afraid you might be under a bit of a misapprehension, Miss. Protection is a very general term. There’s no such thing as a ring that simply guards against everything—at least not outside of an artifact worth hundreds of thousands of gold coins—but let me show you what you’re probably looking for in your line of work.”</p>
<p>The [Merchant] gives me a not-at-all condescending smile that makes me want to deck him as he selects a ring from the items in front of him. He shows me the ring; a slightly cracked circle that feels like it’s made of stone.</p>
<p>“This is a wonderful little trinket that I could sell you—for six hundred gold coins, say? It will deflect arrows for one minute when activated. Arrows will swerve as they fly towards you, perfect for a Runner like you to make their escape.”</p>
<p>“Why’s it cracked?”</p>
<p>Erin peers at the ring next to me. She touches the ring along the crack and the man practically snatches it back.</p>
<p>“<em>Please</em> don’t touch that. The magic on this ring is slightly—faded. Hence the discount. But I can assure you it will last quite a long time if not subjected to undue pressure.”</p>
<p>“Like an arrow?”</p>
<p>He ignores Erin and smiles at me.</p>
<p>“How about it? You could weather any storm of arrows—especially ones shot by Goblin archers. I’m sure you’ve heard about the attack on Esthelm? Tragic. But in your line of work, you can’t afford to stay behind city walls, can you? This ring will allow you plenty of time to escape.”</p>
<p>“For a minute.”</p>
<p>“A minute. Yes.”</p>
<p>Erin frowns as she stares at the ring. I keep my face straight and try to sound disinterested—I know how to haggle. But I’m more interested in seeing how Erin deals with this [Merchant]. I’m pretty sure I don’t even want that crappy ring, but I do want to see the show. Erin points to the ring as she questions the man.</p>
<p>“A minute doesn’t sound like much. How long does it take to recharge?”</p>
<p>He grits his teeth, although he’s still smiling.</p>
<p>“Two days. But you can always recharge it if you have the gift, and I assure you—”</p>
<p>“—And what did you mean earlier? Arrows ‘swerve’? Does that mean it doesn’t really deflect them? Wait a second, why would anyone want a ring like that anyways?”</p>
<p>My lips twitch, and I even see the guards grinning a bit. The [Merchant]’s voice is testy.</p>
<p>“It’s true that the ring doesn’t send arrows in the other direction, but it does repel them from your person. <em>If </em>you are running, I’m confident the arrows would fail to hit their mark. It would take someone with a Skill to bypass the protection this ring offers, and again, let me say for five hundred and seventy gold coins, this ring is a bargain.”</p>
<p>“I bet Halrac could shoot an arrow that could beat your ring.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“Halrac! He’s this guy—a [Scout] that I met at my inn. He’s really good with a bow, and he’s got tons of Skills. What would happen if he shot an arrow at this ring? Would it work?”</p>
<p>The man stares at Erin, brow furrowed.</p>
<p>“Halrac? You mean…Halrac of Griffon Hunt? The Gold-rank adventurer?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s him. He’s a friend of ours. Do you know him?”</p>
<p>For two seconds the [Merchant] stares at Erin. Then he glances at something on his wrist. I look down. One of the gemstones on the man’s bestrewn hands is glowing softly blue. Oho. A truth spell on a stone?</p>
<p>At once, the man’s demeanor changes. He spreads his arms wide, all former irritation gone in a flash as he stands up, now trying to be very welcoming towards us.</p>
<p>“If you know Halrac, that’s different. You know, he bought a very nice amulet from a friend of mine just last year? I’d be very grateful if you’d recommend my wares to him. And for a friend of Halrac, I could certainly offer you…ah…”</p>
<p>He’s clearly trying to figure out what kind of discount and pitch he should give us when I hear familiar voices and groan through clenched teeth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“There she is! Found her!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“She can’t run away this time!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Ooh! Is she looking at magical items? Look how shiny they are! And how weak!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“They barely glow of magic!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Erin looks around, frowning. I’ve already spotted the Frost Faeries—they’re rising in a cloud over one of the roofs. Neither the guards nor the [Merchant] can hear the faeries of course, but they see us looking away and spot the faeries. They’re probably only glowing blurs to them, but all three react when they see the Winter Sprites.</p>
<p>“Not them!”</p>
<p>The [Merchant] exclaims in a loud voice, and one of the guards shouts a warning. Surprisingly, every single shopkeeper on the street suddenly begins to scramble, shouting as they grab at their wares and try to get everything inside.</p>
<p>The faeries fly down, laughing at the chaos as the man grabs at his magical rings and amulets, face suddenly hunted. Erin looks confused.</p>
<p>“Hey wait, where are you going? I thought you were going to sell us that bad ring!”</p>
<p>The man turns to us, looking frantic.</p>
<p>“Look, we’ll do business when the Winter Sprites are gone, alright? If I keep my wares out in the open they’ll scatter my goods and chase away all my customers!”</p>
<p>He rushes towards the nearest door, his guards grabbing the rest of his goods. Other shopkeepers do the same and the pedestrians scatter indoors as well, fearing the wrath of the fickle nuisances. In seconds, the street is deserted except for two humans and the faeries.</p>
<p>Erin and I stare up at the faeries. They stare back as they hover in the air, watching us. One of them waves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After our short shopping trip in the market, the next place Erin and I decide to go is indoors, where the faeries can’t follow. And where we find ourselves is the Adventurer’s Guild. Erin and I stare around the big room as she whispers to me.</p>
<p>“It looks sort of like Selys’s guild, but not, don’t you think? I mean, this place is bigger. A lot bigger.”</p>
<p>I nod as I stare around the Adventurer’s Guild in Celum. This place is certainly a lot bigger, and the room has space for up to six receptionists at once, rather than the single desk for two in Liscor’s guild. I tap on the desk for the receptionist as I ask about hiring a team. She directs me towards the adventurers sitting in one corner of the room. Apparently, hiring an escort is done by contacting the adventurers directly, not through the guild here.</p>
<p>I stare at the groups of adventurers sitting together. Some are Bronze-rank, most are, probably. And others are Silver-rank, whether individually or in teams. A lot of them look tired, cleaning their equipment after some mission, and others look like they’re just here to socialize.</p>
<p>Damnit. Which group should I talk to? What’s the standard rate for hiring them? Can I trust a Silver-rank team? I know none of this.</p>
<p>Neither does Erin, but she has an almost insultingly cavalier attitude towards this.</p>
<p>“Let’s just ask them. If any of them say they can take us to Liscor, let’s try it!”</p>
<p>“You want me to just walk over there and ask them about escort duty?”</p>
<p>I hate talking to new people. I hate starting up conversations, and this is practically my worst nightmare. But Erin just shrugs at me. I grind my teeth.</p>
<p>“What do you expect me to say? ‘Hey, we’re looking for a group of adventurers to escort us to Liscor. Know anyone who might be interested?’”</p>
<p>“That sounds good. Why not?”</p>
<p>I stare at Erin. Well, it might work.</p>
<p>“You say it. I think it’s best if it comes from you.”</p>
<p>Erin nods and begins walking over to the nearest table where two brawny warriors are sitting and drinking together. Halfway there she turns back and looks at me with a smile of realization.</p>
<p>“You know who’d be great, Ryoka? The Horns of Hammerad! Why don’t we just ask them?”</p>
<p>I blink. Oh. Of course. That would save costs or they could redirect us. I walk over towards Erin, but then one of the adventurers sitting at the table raises his voice?</p>
<p>“The Horns of Hammerad? Aren’t they all dead?”</p>
<p>Erin beams at them.</p>
<p>“What? No! No, they’ve reformed, didn’t you hear? After they uh—they lost people at the Ruins in Liscor—”</p>
<p>One of the men snorts. He’s in his late twenties by the looks of him, and he’s got day-old stubble on his face.</p>
<p>“I heard about that disaster. Four adventuring teams dead and only a handful of survivors thanks to a bunch of incompetent Captains. You’re telling me someone’s stupid enough to keep the name after that? They should have quit being adventurers before they ever went on another mission.”</p>
<p>I stop in my tracks and bite my lips. Erin pauses, and the smile on her face freezes. The second adventurer looks at his companion.</p>
<p>“Who survived? I heard everyone got slaughtered down there.”</p>
<p>“At least two made it out. The half-Elf and the Silver Captain.”</p>
<p>“Ceria Springwalker and Yvlon Byres? I wouldn’t join a group with those two even if they were the last team on the continent. Anyone stupid enough to work with them is going to get killed like their last groups.”</p>
<p>Don’t punch them. I know that. Erin’s voice is flat.</p>
<p>“They’re both great adventurers. They’re my friends.”</p>
<p>The two men shake their heads at her.</p>
<p>“They’re idiots and cowards who got good folk who trusted them killed.”</p>
<p>“You might think they’re on your side, but mark my words, girl. Trust them and you’ll end up with an arrow in your back.”</p>
<p>They don’t even bother lowering their voices. People at other tables look up as they hear the two men begin to argue with Erin.</p>
<p>“That’s not true! Ceria’s really brave! So is Yvlon!”</p>
<p>“The half-Elf? I bet she turned and ran the instant she got into trouble. She’s a coward. Calruz was the only real fighter in the Horns of Hammerad.”</p>
<p>“Take that back!”</p>
<p>Erin’s getting mad, and I’m eying the two men seated at their table. They look a lot tougher than the adventurers Erin got into a fight with at her inn. And they’re just talking, not sexually harassing anyone.</p>
<p>But my blood is still boiling. The Horns of Hammerad don’t deserve this. They were all brave, and I could tell them that, but what would be the point? The two sneering men clearly don’t want to listen; the best thing I could do is kick them both in the face.</p>
<p>I could start a fight—</p>
<p>But I close my hand and feel the stumps of my fingers. No. Not here. Not now. We need the help of some adventurers, even if it’s not them.</p>
<p>I put my hand on Erin’s shoulder. She’s tense and glaring.</p>
<p>“Come on, Erin. Let’s talk to someone else.”</p>
<p>“If you want <em>real</em> protection, Miss, you’d best ask us or a real Silver-rank team. Not a bunch of half-wits that can’t even slay a few undead.”</p>
<p>I have to drag Erin backwards. She glares at me, but I manage to pull her back successfully. Five steps. Then I run into someone.</p>
<p>“Oh, sorr—”</p>
<p>I pause as I stare into a familiar, beat-up face. An adventurer pauses with four of his buddies as they walk towards the receptionist’s desk. All of them look beat-upon; the result of a bar fight they were on the losing end of.</p>
<p>The lead adventurer certainly recognizes me.</p>
<p>He takes one look at Erin and begins edging towards the door. Too late. As my grip slackens, Erin pulls herself away. She walks back over to the table with the two adventurers and smiles at them as she puts&nbsp;her hands on the edge of the table.</p>
<p>“You should take back what you said about Ceria and Yvlon. They’re my friends and they did everything they could to keep everyone else alive.”</p>
<p>“We said exactly what everyone else was thinking, Miss. The Horns of Hammerad—both past and present—are a team of fools.”</p>
<p>Erin takes a deep breath. Her eyes are wide and she gives them a big smile.</p>
<p>“Okay. Fine. If that’s the way it’s gonna be then—<em>table flip attack!</em>”</p>
<p>On the whole, I sometimes wonder if Erin’s the more violent one between the two of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Well, now we’re banned from the Adventurer’s Guild. At least for a while.”</p>
<p>I sigh as Erin and I stump along down the street, followed by a cloud of faeries. I’m resigned to them by this point. They fly after us, laughing about the fight. Erin walks behind me, frowning.</p>
<p>“I don’t regret a thing! Those guys were jerks!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, they were. But now they won’t help us if we need to get back to Liscor.”</p>
<p>“So? We’ll just get the Horns of Hammerad to do it. Ceria and Pisces and Yvlon and Ksmvr can probably defend us against anything we run up against.”</p>
<p>“Maybe. But we don’t know where they are. I can try and make a trip to Albez—or put the word out I’m looking for them in other cities, but it’ll take longer.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine.”</p>
<p>Erin nods, and I glance up at the faeries flying overhead. They look…slightly bored, actually. They’re still laughing and one of them is dropping a steady stream of powdery snowflakes into my eyes, but the rest are just following along, quiet for once.</p>
<p>Huh. I guess even faeries get bored. I shrug and keep walking.</p>
<p>“I’m going to do another delivery—to another city probably. I’ll be back tonight unless something comes up. You okay until then?”</p>
<p>“I’m gonna blow something up.”</p>
<p>I grin.</p>
<p>“That sounds like fun. Just try not to piss Octavia off too much, okay?”</p>
<p>I try to drop Erin off at the [Alchemist]’s shop, but to my surprise Octavia herself runs out, waving one of her arms at me as if it’s a club.</p>
<p>“Ryoka? <em>Ryoka!</em>”</p>
<p>Erin walks happily into the shop as the stitch-girl confronts me. Octavia looks stressed out, sort of understandable given that she’s going to be babysitting Erin all day today. Again.</p>
<p>“Hey Octavia, Erin wants to blow something up.”</p>
<p>The young woman’s dark skinned face goes pale as she looks back at Erin in her shop. I feel a bit bad, so I try to reassure her.</p>
<p>“She probably won’t. She’s looking forwards to experimenting with new food recipes, Octavia.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely not! Do you know how much she’s cost me already? One day was in our agreement. I could see two days, maybe three in light of our past arrangements and for future business’s sake, but four? Erin’s already cost me a small fortune in ingredients, not to mention all the time I could be making my own potions. If I’ve got to keep helping her out I insist on some kind of reimbursement. I know we had a bargain, but <em>this—</em>”</p>
<p>I have to take a step back as Octavia shouts and waves her hands at me. Looks like she’s hit the end of her patience. Damn. What should I do?</p>
<p>I hesitate, then take the most expedient course of action. Octavia’s ranting slows and stops dead as I start pulling gold coins out of the bag at my side. From the looks of it, it shouldn’t be able to hold all the gold that’s in there, but it’s magical. There’s a massive book inside as well, and that still amazes me.</p>
<p>“Fine. I get it. Here’s more money for Erin, okay?”</p>
<p>I pour the gold into Octavia’s hands as the [Alchemist] gapes at me. Twenty golden coins—pretty darn heavy and glittering in the light, wink up at the girl as she looks from the money to me.</p>
<p>Twenty gold coins. Yes, it’s a lot, but it’s only a fraction of the money I got from Teriarch. And by the way Octavia goes silent, it’s a lot more than she thought she’d get.</p>
<p>“So. Is there a problem with Erin?”</p>
<p>“Erin? What? Of course not!”</p>
<p>Octavia beams.</p>
<p>“Erin, my favorite customer. I’d be happy to—let me just say that as long as she wants to keep working with me, I’d be delighted to help out. Her achievements really are stellar, and let me tell you that I think she’s onto a real breakthrough—”</p>
<p>“Glad to hear it. Just get her whatever she wants, Octavia.”</p>
<p>I let the [Alchemist] practically skip back into her shop and walk off, shaking my head. The faeries follow me, half imitating my shaking head motion, the other half debating whether it would be more enjoyable to watch Erin blow something up in the shop.</p>
<p>I don’t know. I’m glad that Erin’s happy, and I’m fine with leaving her alone to cause havoc in Octavia’s shop. She’ll probably be fine with Octavia to stop her from doing something too insane.</p>
<p>But—</p>
<p>I’m just a bit tired. At the end of my rope, you could say. It’s not that I don’t have anything to do; I’ve got too much to do.</p>
<p>Time to go on another delivery. I start walking in the direction of the Runner’s Guild again. I might not be feeling at the top of my game, but at least I can always count on running to take the stress away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m looking for a delivery to another city, but I can’t find any requests. Do you have any?”</p>
<p>The receptionist in the Runner’s Guild looks up at me and frowns. She taps one finger against her lips and nods at last.</p>
<p>“We…have the daily letter delivery for Wales if you’re interested.”</p>
<p>Her hesitation is warranted. No one likes that delivery. I make a face.</p>
<p>“Nothing else?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. Sorry Miss Ryoka.”</p>
<p>The [Receptionist] shrinks back slightly in her seat as I stare at her. After a minute I nod.</p>
<p>“Fine. Give me that delivery.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I run through the snow, and then onto harder, slippery ground that’s been frozen over and not thawed. I frown and run back into the snow. It might be more constricting, but thanks to Erin’s soup that I took another drink of before I left, it’s easier to run through the grass underneath the snow than the slippery road.</p>
<p>I’m doing the bulk letter delivery to Wales. It’s…well, it’s not exactly anything to write home about. Or anywhere else for that matter.</p>
<p>Bulk delivery. Just like the post office, letters are taken in and a huge bag full of them is sent off with a City Runner each day to the other cities. It’s a standard delivery, and since it’s so easy, it pays next to nothing.</p>
<p>I haven’t done it since I started working as a Runner. Where did all the big deliveries go? Do people just not need anything during the winter months? No, that can’t be true. Must just be a slow day.</p>
<p>But, like always, I’m not alone. A cloud of faeries flies around me, watching me with heavy-lidded eyes as I run at a good pace through the snow. But all the faces of the faeries aren’t filled with their usual calculated expressions of glee or anticipation. Instead, they all look bored.</p>
<p>It’s actually sort of bugging me. I glance around at the faeries. Some are frowning, and I rarely see them do that. Why haven’t they gone to bother someone else? But then one flying furthest from me speaks, and I hear her voice clearly over the rushing wind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“No. This is boring. I don’t want to do it anymore.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s odd. I stare at the faerie who said that. She has a very unhappy expression on her face. She flies into the center of the herd of faeries and raises her voice as she points at me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“You’re boring now. <em>Boring. </em>Mortal, do something interesting.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m no one’s monkey. Get lost.”</p>
<p>I wave at the faerie as she flies around me. She blows ice fragments into my face, making me curse and nearly trip as she shouts at the other faeries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“See? She does naught! I won’t follow anymore. Not even if a Wyvern flew down and dragged her screaming into the air!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the faeries look up hopefully. So do I. Nothing. The faerie makes a disgusted sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I am done. There are other places to be, other mortals to watch and bother. Not her.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That sounds completely fine to me. Why wouldn’t the faeries go annoy someone else if I’m not entertaining them? They’ve done so before.</p>
<p>But this time, the faerie’s words seem to have a lot more significance to them. The other faeries exchange looks, and then begin to argue overhead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“But she wants—”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Nae, I don’t care as well! We’ve done this too long!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Yeah! She went to the <em>Dragon</em> and nothing happened!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I’m going!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Me too!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I’m staying. No. Wait. I’m going too!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Let’s go bother a King! Or a Queen!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I want to eat berries in the jungle!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The faeries…begin flying away. They flutter upwards in a storm of flashing wings and movement. I stare up at them, my heart beating out of my chest for some reason.</p>
<p>They’re going? Forever? Or will they come back? What they said—</p>
<p>I don’t mind. Not at all. If the Frost Faeries leave me alone, no one will be happier than I…</p>
<p>I stumble on something in the snow. When I raise my foot, I see blood. Cut my skin on a bit of rock. Damn.</p>
<p>Then I look up, and they’re gone. The sky is clear, and the faeries—</p>
<p>The Frost Faeries are gone. The winter they brought remains, but the magic has left. I feel empty. Relieved?</p>
<p>No. Not relieved. They’re gone, and I don’t know why.</p>
<p>I turn back to my run. Don’t think about it. Why would they do that? What did they mean? How was I boring? Was it something I did? What was so wrong about the game of riddles with Teriarch?</p>
<p>A flash of liquid ice to my left. My head snaps around so fast I hear a <em>crick</em>.</p>
<p>They’re not all gone. I see a pale blue shape flying in the air beside me. A Frost Faerie, easily keeping pace with me as I run through the snowy landscape.</p>
<p>One of them is still following. Just one, flying up and to my right, sitting in the air as her wings beat disproportionately slowly to the speed she’s going. Just one.</p>
<p>For some reason, the tension in my heart eases. I feel a bit lighter, although I don’t know why. I stare at the faerie and nearly trip again. She waves at me and grins.</p>
<p>Why is she here? I open my mouth to ask, and then see something to my right. Something closing in fast.</p>
<p>Instantly, I reach for a potion at my belt and slow as I fixate on that, forgetting completely about the faerie. I see a blur—something racing through the snow, and—is that laughter? And I see a pale, pinched face, and catch a glimpse of someone for just one second before she’s past me, speeding down the frozen road at a pace I could never match.</p>
<p>I come to a dead stop in the snow, my feet melting the snow I stand on as I stare at the already distant figure running past me, towards another city.</p>
<p>No way. It can’t be. But I say it out loud anyways.</p>
<p>“Is that…Persua?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no idea. I think it was Persua. She has that same sallow* face and annoying complexion as ever, and her running form was crap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*I know sallow isn’t the right word, but I’m still using it for her. Pinched is probably a better word, but I like sallow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the way she moved! She was moving faster than I was—way faster. How? No, I know how. A Skill. But can it really happen that fast? Persua was the slowest City Runner I knew, even slower than Garia because she took regular breaks. And now—</p>
<p>I shake my head as I sit in the small room I’ve rented in the Frenzied Hare. Erin’s got her own room for which I’m grateful; I need the alone time right now.</p>
<p>I finished my delivery. It was an easy thing; I don’t even have to track down the individual recipients myself with a bulk delivery. I just hand it over to the receptionist at the local Runner’s Guild and get my pay.</p>
<p>Easy. And now I’m relaxing in my room, using the few hours I have before dinner to do some studying. Not dwelling on Persua; studying.</p>
<p>I sigh and look back at the massive tome in front of me. A book—a magical spell book lies on the table in front of me, so big there’s nowhere else on the table for me to put anything else.</p>
<p>I’m studying magic. That’s what I’ve been doing every day, while Erin causes havoc in Octavia’s shop and generally runs about the city. I’ve cut back on doing my deliveries to make time for this.</p>
<p>Learning magic. Learning spells from the tome of wonders that Teriarch gave me. And how many new spells have I learned today?</p>
<p>Well, none, actually. And how many did I learn yesterday?</p>
<p>None, again. In fact, ever since I opened the book to this page I’ve been…</p>
<p>Stuck.</p>
<p>I stare down at the page covered with words that are part magic, part language. They shine at me, spelling out secrets in the magical language that I can only comprehend at a snail’s pace. But I can read the words—</p>
<p>I just can’t accept what they say.</p>
<p>I raise my hand, and take a breath. It’s not that warm in my room; there’s not exactly central heating in this building, although heat does come up from the ground floor. But it’s chilly even so, and I opened the window to let some air in, despite the freezing cold outside. None of the windows in this inn have glass, so either I keep the shutters closed and suffocate, or face the weather.</p>
<p>Ignore that. Concentrate. I fix all my attention on my hand and try to push an invisible force into the right place. Let it condense, like rainwater. Make it into a current and <em>push—</em></p>
<p>“[Water Spray].”</p>
<p>I say the words, and try to use the magic. But nothing happens. I stare at my hand, and say the words again.</p>
<p>“[Water Spray].”</p>
<p>Again, my hand and the air around it are completely still.</p>
<p>“Damn it.”</p>
<p>It’s not working. I look back at the page in the book and clench my fists. Another failure.</p>
<p>“It makes no sense. It’s not—”</p>
<p>I take another breath, and try to exhale slowly. No. It’s really not working, is it? I can’t figure it out. This—</p>
<p>This isn’t working.</p>
<p>I stand up and walk slowly around my cramped room. Yeah. I’ve been trying to put off this conclusion for a while. Day after day I’ve done this, but I’m no closer to the answer than I was yesterday. I have to call it. I have to say it.</p>
<p>“I can’t do it.”</p>
<p>This is the real reason why every day hasn’t been great. Stress, Goblins, all of my worries are one thing, but I think I could have handled it all if it wasn’t for this.</p>
<p>I can’t learn magic. I thought I could, but I can’t. I got this book from Teriarch, a complete beginner’s guide to spells that <em>should</em> allow me to learn every spell easily and quickly. Hell, I mastered one of the spells in the book in minutes! But I tried reading more spells before I delivered the book to Krshia and its…just not working for me.</p>
<p>The first two spells were easy. I learned a basic telekinesis cantrip—the ability to lift things up like Ceria and Pisces do. Nothing fancy, and I’d have to really work to lift more than the few snowflakes off the table, but it was easy enough to grasp. And then I figured out how to blow air around, another fun trick. But then I started reading another spell—[Water Spray], a very simplistic spell that’s probably Tier 0, and I got stuck.</p>
<p>I stare down at the page again. There are no pictures, probably because magic isn’t something you can just describe in words. But I look at the meanings described on the page and I know exactly what must be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Let the magic condense, coalesce into a liquid, a real thing. Let it pool and grow, into a current and ocean of its own. Hold it, and then let it manifest as you push it outwards into the shape you desire. Magic is like water, a rushing thing to be guided, but never forced. You cannot force the sea to move, but you can give it a channel—</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why can’t I get this? Well, because I can’t believe it works. Simple as that. I understand how the spell goes and how I conjure water out of the air but—</p>
<p>I can’t do it. It violates the basic laws of physics. To cast [Water Spray], I need to turn magic into water, anchor it in a form and then use magic to spray it out. Simple.</p>
<p>But I <em>know</em> that it’s impossible. Magic into matter? It doesn’t work like that. It violates the laws of thermodynamics! What about conservation of energy? The water dissipates fast, but does it evaporate or turn back into magic?</p>
<p>And what about fire? How is it mimicking a natural reaction if it’s burning…magic? Would it still burn in an airtight room?</p>
<p>I clutch at my head. This is all wrong. It should be easy. I get how it works, but now—</p>
<p>I can’t <em>believe</em> it works. That’s the problem. All the science I know, all the laws of my reality I’ve grown up with—they’re telling me what I’m trying to do is impossible, making me doubt what I’m doing and ask questions this book can’t answer.</p>
<p>And magic is partly faith. It must be. If I don’t believe what I’m doing will work, it won’t work. And I don’t believe I can cast this spell. I suppose I just didn’t think about it with the [Light] spell and even when I learned to make fire. But making water out of nothing just doesn’t—</p>
<p>The problem becomes a loop of errors in my head as I struggle to convince myself that I <em>can</em> conjure water out of nothing. But it doesn’t help. I can try to do the spell, but it won’t work. I have to know. I have to understand, and I think…</p>
<p>“I can’t do this.”</p>
<p>Not with this book. I stare down at it, wanting to throw up, or throw it through my window. It’s so easy to learn with this book. It should be. But because I went to school and studied all these damn lessons about how the world works, I can’t believe in these spells.</p>
<p>“Education ruined magic.”</p>
<p>I don’t want to believe that’s true, but I’ve been stuck on this one spell. I can’t move on until I complete it—I just can’t. Even when I look at other spells, all the doubts that popped into my head from this one follow me from page to page.</p>
<p>Maybe if I stare at it longer, something will click. [Water Spray]. Magic turns into water, water appears. I can’t—</p>
<p>Damnit.</p>
<p>I’m so miserable and angry at myself I want to put my fist through something. A wall, maybe. I clench my fingers on my right hand and stare at the deformed fist I make.</p>
<p>Something else to add more depression to my day. I stare at the book and my hand.</p>
<p>Today wasn’t a bad day. Not really. I did some deliveries. I got to see Erin punch an adventurer in the face. I saw Persua—</p>
<p>And the faeries think I’m boring. They left.</p>
<p>All except one.</p>
<p>I look out my window. The sky is gray and the rooftops are filled with snow. But is she out there? Or has she gone too?</p>
<p>She’s out there. I didn’t even realize it at first. But I see something hovering just outside my window. A faint blue shape, holding so still in the air that I didn’t even realize she was watching me.</p>
<p>A Frost Faerie meets my eyes as I stare at her and nearly tumble out of my seat. She laughs at me as I stare at her and feel the wind blow into my room.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>She smiles at me, and floats forwards a bit. The wind is blowing hard, but she doesn’t even seem to be affected by the air that blows my hair about and flicks the pages on the spellbook. She’s in a little world of her own, but she stops at the edge of my windowsill.</p>
<p>Oh. Right. I stare at her and the room I’m in. Faeries are a bit like Vampires. They can’t enter unless invited. Do I have the right? I don’t own this inn—</p>
<p>But I am renting this room. I cough and clear my throat.</p>
<p>“Come in. If you want.”</p>
<p>The faerie stares at me for a second, and then nods in agreement. She alights on my windowsill and dances into the room, twirling and leaping onto my desk with effortless grace. Her feet leave frost on the wood wherever they touch, and I can sense the chill from her.</p>
<p>The faerie shivers, although I don’t. She looks around the room darkly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Too much cold iron here. ‘Tis not a good place for true magics, or my kind. But then, ye can’t even master a few tricks, so the iron doubtless hinders ye little.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s the first words she says. Not ‘hello’ or ‘how are you?’ or even ‘sorry I was spying on you this entire time’. She just jumps into the heart of the conversation like that. I like that about faeries.</p>
<p>“You mean iron interferes with spells? Is that why I can’t master this one?”</p>
<p>The faerie shakes her head at me as she scoffs at the large tome on my table. She steps on one of the pages and kicks the parchment with a foot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Pshaw. The magic yon book teaches is only a fragment of true magic. Ye should know that.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I do. But I don’t know real magic. A fragment is better than nothing.”</p>
<p>The faerie nods, and looks at me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“True. But you cannot learn even that, can ye? I’ve been watching you, and a toad would pick up that spell faster than ye can.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bite my tongue. But she’s right.</p>
<p>“I can’t figure it out.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“And neither will you. You think too much and feel far too little. You look for rules where none exist, and make your own to hold you back. Ye won’t learn magic like this.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t want to hear that. But the faerie’s words ring true. I clench my teeth again, but—she’s not trying to be rude. Okay, she’s doing it without much thought, but I know enough about faeries to realize she’s being direct with me, and as helpful as she can.</p>
<p>“Thanks for the advice.”</p>
<p>She inclines her head regally. I know I shouldn’t ever thank a faerie, at least according to legend, but she doesn’t seem malicious. Hell, the faeries know my full name and they haven’t done anything to me.</p>
<p>What do they want? I clear my throat awkwardly again as the faerie looks around my little room. Here I am, with a faerie in my room. I should…she’s the last one. I need to ask questions. First though, make her welcome.</p>
<p>“Can I offer you anything? Something to eat or drink?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Do ye have anything?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“…No.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Then don’t offer, fool.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, off to a bad start. I stare at the faerie as she leaps up into the air at eye height and sits there, as if there’s an invisible cushion under her.</p>
<p>“Why are you here? By yourself, I mean. All of your friends flew off.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“They did. They grew bored of ye, and went to find excitement somewhere else.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A straightforward answer. But I still don’t get why.</p>
<p>“Is it because of Teriarch and the game of riddles I played with him? Is that why they all left?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“In part.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The faerie nods as she scratches at the bottom of her foot with a tiny digit. She yawns widely, showing me sharp teeth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“My sisters think ‘twas ill done. They dislike the trickery of numbers, but it is just as good as the trickery of words to me.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You disagree?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I like such things now and then, and it was well done to win even in losing. We are not all alike, my kin. Does it surprise you that one of us would like the dance of thoughts as much as the dance of tongues?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No. I should have known not all fairies were alike. I just—okay, maybe that was fairly racist. Speciesist? Why is it that the immortal species, Dragons and fae, tend to leave me thoughtless and speechless? It’s like all of my cynicism and complex questions fade away in their presence. There’s no doubting their presence when they’re in front of you.</p>
<p>The faerie points at something close to falling off the edge of my desk. The bag of holding and golden coins sits innocuously; just large enough for a handful of coins at best, certainly not large enough to hold this magical book. But it can hold a huge amount of space—all my bed covers and two chairs besides, I’ve found. After that it just acts like a normal bag until I start pulling stuff out. I haven’t yet found the courage to put my head inside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Yon lies your prize for a Dragon’s duel. Golden coins and a magic bag to hold them. ‘Tis every mortal’s dream, isn’t it? Or did you want something else from the old scales and smoke?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Did I?”</p>
<p>The faerie flies forwards and smacks me on the nose before I can blink. I yelp and touch my frozen flesh—she glares at me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Either you did or ye didn’t. Don’t answer a question with a question, ye prat.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, I have to restrain the urge to punch back. I’d probably lose, and I know the faeries are prickly. And she’s right. Sort of.</p>
<p>“Sorry. I don’t know what I wanted from him. Maybe I could have asked him to teach me magic.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“He would have said no. He’s a lazy oaf, that wyrm.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Maybe. But I got most of what I wanted.”</p>
<p>She nods, and I fall silent for a second. The real question is burning on my tongue. I have to know, so I ask it.</p>
<p>“Why did you stay when the others left? What do the fae really want with me? With this world?”</p>
<p>She looks at me archly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Why ask a question you know I will not answer? You want to know more than you should. You ask a question I could not answer with ten thousand words as if it were a simple thing.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Sue me. I’m curious. Is what I asked too broad? Why are you following me?”</p>
<p>The faerie sighs with exasperated patience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Why do I follow anyone?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I thought you said not to answer a question with a question.”</p>
<p>This time I’m ready and I swat at her as she flies at my face. The faerie flips over my hand with nimble grace and kicks my forehead. For a small creature she hits <em>hard.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Smart as an ass, aren’t ye? I follow and watch ye in case you do something of worth. You told me and my kin stories, and dared to defy the fates. You bargained with a Dragon, and met one who rules over death. Is there any other mortal I should bother following that’s done more?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When she says it like that…I almost blush. I clear my throat. It’s so awkward, but the faerie doesn’t seem the least bit embarrassed, and that just makes me embarrassed. She doesn’t lie; she just says what she thinks.</p>
<p>“You’ve been following me for a while, haven’t you? I thought you were familiar—have I spoken to you specifically before?”</p>
<p>She nods and flashes me a smile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Oh yes. I followed you with the others as you ran, and I was the one you struck. I listened to tales of Humans from your world, and it was I who warned you of the armies and led you through the forest. I was there when you cast the bargain, and I accepted the second price. I am surprised you noticed; most beings cannot tell us apart.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought so. For the longest time I just thought of all the faeries as one and the same, but this one—she and I have spoken more than I thought. I stare at the small faerie, and feel a sudden connection with her.</p>
<p>“So all of your sisters are gone because I’m too boring and you’re still sticking around. What do you want?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“What do ye think I want?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The faerie looks me in the eye, practically daring me to point out her evasiveness. I don’t do that this time. Instead, I think. She’s not answering me because she can’t. Or she doesn’t want to. So what’s the answer?</p>
<p>“Maybe…because you want something of me. Or there’s something I can do for you?”</p>
<p>The tiny faerie rolls her eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Hah!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, that’s not it. Then there’s something else. Or—</p>
<p>“Could it be you just want to see what happens next?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“An obvious answer. I suppose ye are right.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The faerie shakes her small head, disappointed. I feel guilty, as if I’ve failed an easy test. But what could she want?</p>
<p>I wish Erin were here to answer. She’d have the damn answer in a second, somehow. She’s better with people than I am. She’d be making friends with the fae in a heartbeat—she could probably befriend a rabid bear.</p>
<p>But then—even she’s had problems with the fae before. She told me about their scam with the fake flowers. I’m really the only person who’s dealt with them for a long period of time. The faeries have hung around me, and I even managed to gain their respect.</p>
<p>And this one has followed me a long ways. Even when her friends are gone she’s stuck around? Why? That’s almost like…</p>
<p>Like…</p>
<p>“A friend.”</p>
<p>The faerie looks up at me. She’d been busy spinning around in the air, but now she pauses, completely upside down and stares at me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“What?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Is that what you want? A friend?”</p>
<p>It’s a stupid question. And a stupid conclusion to make. We’re not in a kid’s tv show, but maybe—no.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Friends? Ye would be friends with the fae?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She scoffs at me, mockingly. But the tiny fae face isn’t as genuinely annoyed as normal, and I see what looks like a smile twitching around the scowl. I grin at her.</p>
<p>“Maybe. I wouldn’t mind having one of you floating about. I know of a certain hero that did that for quite a long time.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I’m no pet, mortal.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“No, but you are interested in me. And if you’re going to follow me about, why not get to know one another?”</p>
<p>The faerie lies down sideways on the air and props her head on one hand as she stares at me. Seriously, this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Do you know what would happen if ye dared to mingle with the fae? There are laws, mortal. Ones that shouldn’t be crossed.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hesitate. Now I feel like I’m being tested. But I can only go on what I know of her. I’ve seen so much of the fae, and I think I understand the answer to this question. I nod at her, just as serious as she is.</p>
<p>“There are consequences. I know. Dire ones. But wouldn’t a friend be willing to risk anything for another friend? I’d be honored to get to know you, if you’d let me.”</p>
<p>For a second the faerie’s face is blank. She stares at me from head to toe. And then she grins at me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Good! You finally understand a bit. You are such a fool, you, that I thought ye’d never figure it out.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I blink at her. But the faerie flies closer, and smiles again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I’ve grown interested in your kind again, after so long. If you want to talk with me, I suppose a friend would be better than strangers, eh?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can’t believe it. But suddenly my heart is beating fast, and I feel a surge of passion and life in my chest. I feel alive again.</p>
<p>“I—of course. I’d be honored, as I said. My name is Ryoka Griffin, but you know that. Can I ask your name or is that wrong?”</p>
<p>The faerie considers this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“My name—my truest of names—is a secret to all. And ye would not be able to pronounce it even so. But you may call me…Ivolethe.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe. The name rings in my ears for a second. But the faerie isn’t done. Carefully, she extends a small hand towards me. It’s such a small hand, but I extend a finger and let her shake that. For a second, the briefest second I feel coldness, the deepest chill, and at the same time a wonderful cool, a refreshing breeze and the taste of winter on my skin. It’s not at all unpleasant; I could have experienced that forever. But then the touch is gone.</p>
<p>But the faerie remains. Ivolethe flies back and stands on the table. I stare at her, and see her grin again. Pointed teeth, and a gaze older than the world. Her insectile wings fan out, and she begins to freeze the wood under her feet. But she’s here, and she and I are friends.</p>
<p>I’m friends with a faerie.</p>
<p>Suddenly, everything’s okay again.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When I came down with Ivolethe on my shoulder Erin freaked out.</p>
<p>“<em>Oh my god! A faerie!</em>”</p>
<p>She doesn’t do subtle. As every eye turns to me I glance at Ivolethe. The small fairy is just sitting on my shoulder, looking around with keen interest.</p>
<p>She’s not even that cold; she’s definitely part ice, but she’s not giving me frostbite, which&nbsp; I think is a definite improvement. To be honest, it’s like having a miniature air conditioner on my shoulder. Not ideal in the winter, but I’d pay anything for one on a hot summer day.</p>
<p>“How’d she get in? Don’t cause an avalanche again! Please? It’s not even my inn!”</p>
<p>I have to smile as Erin tries to shield herself with a serving tray as a shield. She really, <em>really</em> can’t do subtle. I wait for someone to ask what Erin’s looking at—</p>
<p>Until I realize they’re still staring. Everyone. Agnes, the guests, the two barmaids—everyone. And they’re looking directly at Ivolethe.</p>
<p>Slowly, I look at the faerie on my shoulder. She looks like normal, but—</p>
<p>“Hey Ivolethe. Can the others…see you?”</p>
<p>The faerie shrugs as she looks around the room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Perhaps. There is much iron here. Too much for a glamour.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She looks at some of the gaping faces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Yes. I think they can, or they would not gape like buffoons.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It <em>talks!</em>”</p>
<p>Agnes exclaims in tones of ringing horror. Yep. They can hear Ivolethe, too. I stare at Erin. She stares at me.</p>
<p>“Wait, where are the rest of them, Ryoka?”</p>
<p>I look around the room. Everyone’s still staring. This is amazingly awkward.</p>
<p>“I’ll uh—explain in a bit. Can we get a seat, Erin? Agnes?”</p>
<p>That breaks the spell. In a few seconds I’m seated in the center of the room, while everyone tries to cluster around me asking questions. I hate it. I try to relocate to a corner of the room, but Erin won’t hear of it and Agnes is beaming. She probably smells another attraction for the inn.</p>
<p>Ivolethe looks unconcerned as well. She stares up at the Humans around us, older men and women mostly, mostly married couples or travelers, and sniffs. I’ll say this for her and the other faeries; they’ve all got the air of little queens, with the arrogance to match.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Well? What are ye staring at?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one moves. Even Erin’s staring with fascination at Ivolethe as she sits on my shoulder. I clear my throat.</p>
<p>“She’s right. This is private, so if you’d all leave now?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Yes, begone or I will curse ye with faerie magic!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one moves. Ivolethe scowls. For my part, I’m at a loss. Normally my…charming disposition helps scare away even the friendliest busybody, but these people are too fascinated by her. One of them, a burly man with massive forearms, speaks.</p>
<p>“Is this really a Winter Sprite? Truly?”</p>
<p>“Yup! Doesn’t she look cool? I guess faeries can’t disguise themselves when they’re indoors, huh?”</p>
<p>More confusion and looks among the other onlookers.</p>
<p>“Faeries? What are faeries?”</p>
<p>I open my mouth at the same time Erin does, but both of us pause. This world doesn’t know about the fae? Even though there are actual faeries that visit regularly? Ivolethe sits up with indignation on my shoulder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Whelp! Ignorant fool! I am a member of the Winter Court! I demand respect!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The man just looks at her curiously. I sense…trouble.</p>
<p>“They’re the creatures that bring winter each year?”</p>
<p>“And throw snow at us from the sky?”</p>
<p>“And torment the animals?”</p>
<p>Some of the other onlookers look closer at Ivolethe. To her credit, she shows not a whit of fear. Can faeries even feel fear? When have I ever seen them even acting afraid? Oh yeah. When they were facing down a fire-breathing Dragon. Shit.</p>
<p>“I don’t think annoying her is a good idea.”</p>
<p>Erin looks scared. She told me the faeries once threw an avalanche into her old inn when Pisces bothered them. I…don’t want to see that here.</p>
<p>But Ivolethe appears remarkably restrained despite her clear ire. Why? My analytical side takes less than a second to give my unhappy brain a response.</p>
<p>Normally, any of the faeries would have thrown snow or frozen the people around us if they were this mad. But Ivolethe hasn’t done that because she can’t. Cold iron saps a faerie’s strength and makes them mortal. She can’t use her magic here.</p>
<p>What she can use is her mouth. So she does.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Leave me you fool, or I will make you suffer! A faerie’s oath on it!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s bad too! I open my mouth, but the big guy isn’t impressed any longer.</p>
<p>“You can’t do anything. You’re just like one of them Fraerlings in Baleros. Tiny.”</p>
<p>He cautiously pokes her where her breasts would be if she had nipples. I open my mouth and shove my chair back, but Ivolethe moves first. Her tiny mouth opens and <em>bites.</em></p>
<p>The scream is immediate and loud. Ivolethe might be tiny, but she’s still big enough to take a <em>chunk</em> out of the man’s finger. Not just a chunk; she bites so far down that I see bone as he yanks his hand away. Her teeth cut through his flesh like nothing.</p>
<p>The man screams again as he holds up his bloody finger. Everyone, including me, stares in horror at Ivolethe. The faerie looks supremely unconcerned as she turns her head and reveals bulging cheeks. She chews, swallows, and grins at us with bloody teeth. Then she waves at Agnes, whose smile has frozen on her face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Innkeep! Your finest meat and drink! I am a guest here, am I not? I want service!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The onlookers desert our table in seconds. The big man might have come back for vengeance, but Agnes drags him away with promises of a healing potion. Erin and I stare at Ivolethe as she hops off my shoulder and onto the table. After a while Erin looks at me.</p>
<p>“So…Ryoka. Introduce me to your friend.”</p>
<p>I nod. Ivolethe triumphantly leaps up as one of the barmaids comes hurrying back with some stew. Erin must have made it ahead of time, because it smells delicious. The faerie leaps <em>into</em> the bowl as if it were a hot tub and immediately begins chomping down on her immediate surroundings. I carefully move the bowl into the center of the table and clear my throat.</p>
<p>“This is…Ivolethe, Erin. She’s one of the Frost Faeries that’s been following me around since I met them. And she <em>is </em>my friend.”</p>
<p>“Right. That’s what I said.”</p>
<p>“No, I mean, she’s my friend. I am friends with a faerie.”</p>
<p>Did I say that with too much reverence? Maybe. But the words that I speak aloud are magical in their own way. A faerie. I really have one of the fae sitting in front of me, chomping down on a slice of potato the size of her head in a bowl full of soup. My friend.</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh.”</p>
<p>Erin finally gets it. She puts her hands on her cheeks in delight.</p>
<p>“You made a friend! Ryoka made a friend! I’m really pleased to meet you, Ivolethe! Any friend of Ryoka’s is a friend of mine. I’m sure we’ll get along great—”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“No.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>Ivolethe doesn’t even look straight at Erin. She takes another bite of the potato and squishes it into a ball with both hands. Then dunks the potato into the gravy and scarfs the rest of it down. Her eating is both disgusting and fascinating to watch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I will not be your friend, Human. I have made one friend, and she is the reason I entered this place of iron and sacks of flesh. I do not need another, and if I did, it would certainly not be ye.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Erin’s face falls. I don’t quite look at her, and I’m not quite smiling behind my hand. Looks like she’s met someone she <em>can’t </em>instantly charm. Hah!</p>
<p>“What? But you guys like me, right?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Why should I or any of my kin like a thoughtless waste of space like ye?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I…I made that big feast for you all! You loved it! And you paid me in gold, which turned out to be fake flowers—but you said it was a great meal! You did!”</p>
<p>I cough.</p>
<p>“I don’t think Ivolethe was there, Erin. Not all the faeries stayed around your inn. Some were with me the entire time.”</p>
<p>“Oh. But I did make food! Magical food! I even got a Skill from it!”</p>
<p>Ivolethe looks slightly impressed. She stops eating to study Erin from head to toe, at any rate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Truly? A faerie’s banquet? I was not there, but my kin spoke of it. My answer remains no.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I interrupt Erin before she can try again. I’m not sure how Ivolethe would react if Erin pushed the matter—and I don’t want her losing a digit.</p>
<p>“I’m sure Erin respects your decisions, Ivolethe. But she’s my friend as well. My best Human friend. I uh, was just wondering if we could talk. Unless you’re busy?”</p>
<p>Erin gives me a betrayed glance, but Ivolethe just shakes her head. She sinks deeper into the bowl of soup; I notice the steam has already stopped rising, and it looks like the gravy is starting to congeal thanks to Ivolethe’s freezing presence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“If I had aught to do, I would be doing it. And we are already talking, fool.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yikes. Ivolethe may call herself my friend, but she’s clearly going to be the kind of friend who uses words as barbs no matter how close we are. I always wondered what having a friend like that would be like.</p>
<p>I wondered what having a true friend would be like, too. Maybe that’s why I can’t stop smiling. Erin’s looking at both me and the faerie oddly.</p>
<p>“You look so creepy right now, Ryoka.”</p>
<p>“Shut up, Erin. Ivolethe? Why can everyone see you indoors? Is it because of the iron?”</p>
<p>Ivolethe sits up a bit in her bowl as two more come for Erin and me, complete with soft, warm sliced bread. She stares around at the other tables, and the other guests instantly look down at their food.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Hmf. It is the iron. Too much of it interferes with our magic. Outside it would not matter, but indoors is like a cage in a way. I cannot use my spells. But I can bite.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She grins at me again with those sharp teeth. Erin shudders.</p>
<p>“Interesting. But Erin and I can see you no matter if we’re outside or not. Why is that?”</p>
<p>A tiny shrug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I do not know. If ye had the eyes of a cat or god—or ye were great masters of magic like Myrddin, it would make sense. But ye aren’t.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Erin looks confused.</p>
<p>“Who’s <em>Myrddin?</em>”</p>
<p>“Merlin, Erin.”</p>
<p>“Oh. <em>Oh.</em> Merlin! He’s real! What’s he like? Does he have a cool staff? What kind of magic did he—”</p>
<p>I cut Erin off, although I really want to know as well. The thing about faeries is that you have to stick to one subject and keep bothering them about it. Get sidetracked and they’ll lead you down a merry trail of breadcrumbs, but never get to the truth.</p>
<p>“We don’t have that kind of magic, Ivolethe. So how else would we see you? Are there any ways mortals can see faeries?”</p>
<p>She shrugs again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Plenty. If you stood in the right place under full moon, or caught us dancing without glamor—if you had the secret drink of the fae, you would be able to see us, but I would know if ye were taught thusly.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Drink? Of the fae?”</p>
<p>Erin looks confused…again…so I explain it to her. How does she not know any myths about faeries?</p>
<p>“The faerie’s drink would be given to people trusted enough to enter a faerie mound. They would be able to see the secret world with it. Could it be that?”</p>
<p>A rude snort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Hardly. Ye cannot simply make the faerie’s drink by chance. Ye would need the essence of countless gases and things not known to ye humans. Poisons and humors of foul natures beyond your ken.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Such as…?”</p>
<p>Ivolethe sighs dramatically. But there’s a wicked gleam in her eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Ye truly want to know? Then, grab as many insects as ye can, Humans! Crunch them up in your mouth, for one of the ingredients is the shell of bugs that may be used to create blood out of water.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ew! You have to eat that?”</p>
<p>Ivolethe nods in satisfaction as Erin wrinkles her nose. But I pause. Blood out of water? That sounds like part of a riddle; probably the rhyme to the faeries’ drink they’d tell people. Blood out of water. A dye?</p>
<p>“When you say insects that can be used to create blood out of water…do you mean carmine? In that case, Erin and I have eaten lots of that already.”</p>
<p>“What? We <em>have?</em>”</p>
<p>Erin turns horrified eyes to me. Ivolethe looks up sharply as well. I nod.</p>
<p>“Carmine is a big ingredient in anything colored red, Erin. Skittles, lemonade…if you’ve had anything like that in the past, you’ve eaten ground up insect shells.”</p>
<p>Just a little bit, in truth. But Erin turns pale and Ivolethe looks…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Well, there are many other things that go into the brew. Not just…that.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Maybe we’ve eaten all the ingredients before.”</p>
<p>“Really? Like <em>bugs?</em>”</p>
<p>“We eat countless bugs each year, Erin. They’re all ground up in our food. And companies use a lot of preservatives…”</p>
<p>I think out loud as Erin makes gagging sounds over her meat.</p>
<p>“The U.S. government started putting fluoride in the water decades ago. And we breathe in any number of pollutants that we didn’t in the past. Add that to whatever they put in most foods in the form of preservatives and to change the taste…Ivolethe, what else goes into your brew?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“As if I’d tell you! The brew is secret to all mortals! And ye’d never guess in a million years!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Really? Let me just list off a few things and you let me know if I’m getting close. Sodium nitrate? Propylene glycol? Uh…what’s it called…olestra? Monosodium glutamate? Sodium benzoate?”</p>
<p>She glares at me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I do not know half of these names! You must be making them up!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Really? Well, sodium benzoate originally came from benzoin, a resin found on trees. It’s an ingredient in incense—”</p>
<p>I see Ivolethe’s eyes widen. Just for a fraction of a second, and then her head spins away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I-I don’t know anything about such things. This talk bores me!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Erin and I exchange a glance. But Ivolethe’s mouth is clamped shut. Erin leans over to me, looking slightly green.</p>
<p>“Do you think it’s true?”</p>
<p>“What, that we ate all of the ingredients of the faerie brew? It might be possible. We eat a lot of weird stuff, Erin.”</p>
<p>“Not that! Do we really eat <em>bugs?</em>”</p>
<p>I sigh.</p>
<p>“Yes. We do, Erin. You know about all the stuff food companies put in candy and fast food. Why are you surprised?”</p>
<p>“I thought they were just chemicals and poisonous stuff! If I knew <em>bugs </em>were in Skittles, I’d never eat any again!”</p>
<p>“That’s not—why would you be okay with…? Okay, never mind Erin. Ivolethe?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“You shall get nothing from me! I will not reveal my kind’s secrets so easily!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The faerie sinks up to her ears in the cold soup. I raise my hands.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to ask you any more questions. I was just curious. Why don’t we talk about something else.”</p>
<p>“Yes! Let’s!”</p>
<p>Erin grabs her milk and drinks deeply from it. With a little coaxing, I get Ivolethe to come out of her stew. She dries herself off on a slice of bread, and then she sits on the table with Erin and me. And we talk.</p>
<p>“So, what did you do after I left you, Erin?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I just made some stuff at Octavia’s. You know, more experimental stuff.”</p>
<p>“Huh. Where’s Octavia now? I’ve never seen her eat—does she do it at her home or should we invite her here now and then?”</p>
<p>I think that would be the polite thing to do, but Erin shakes her head.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but Octavia won’t want to eat today. She’s in bed with bad food poisoning.”</p>
<p>I pause.</p>
<p>“How bad?”</p>
<p>“<em>Bad.</em>”</p>
<p>“…And how did she get so sick, Erin?”</p>
<p>The other girl doesn’t quite meet my gaze.</p>
<p>“I uh, fed her something that didn’t come out as well as I’d hoped.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I would like to try it!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Oh no, it’s impossible. I threw it out—it was starting to stain the pot. It was just another failure.”</p>
<p>Erin sighs. I eye her.</p>
<p>“You’ve been going over to Octavia’s every day. Still trying to make new recipes?”</p>
<p>“Yup! I don’t want to go back to Liscor until I figure out how to make more cool stuff.”</p>
<p>“What about your inn?”</p>
<p>“What about it? Mrsha’s safe with Selys, and I don’t know where Toren is. My inn can stay where it is, right?”</p>
<p>“But Lyonette’s in it.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Yeah.”</p>
<p>Erin smacks her forehead lightly. I shake my head. Erin hesitates.</p>
<p>“She’ll probably be okay. I really want to stay here for a little while longer, though, Ryoka. I can experiment with Octavia all day, and I can help Agnes out at night!”</p>
<p>“And you’re not bored? You’re okay with that?”</p>
<p>Erin looks at me blankly.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Why not?”</p>
<p>Ivolethe and I shrug at the same time.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t matter to me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“‘Tis your choice to die of boredom.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Erin scowls at us, but then she smiles widely at Ivolethe again.</p>
<p>“Soooo…Ivolethe! You must have lived a long time, right?”</p>
<p>The faerie eyes Erin suspiciously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“That is obvious.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“And you met all kinds of cool people—like Merlin and King Arthur, right?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Perhaps. What of it, mortal?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Erin throws up her hands.</p>
<p>“Tell me stories! Tell us all about Merlin, and the knights of the round table.”</p>
<p>Ivolethe considers this, one tiny hand on her chin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“No.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I do not want to.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Please?”</p>
<p>“Erin…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“No. Such tales are too grand for the likes of you.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>I put a hand on Erin’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“You heard her, Erin. Ivolethe doesn’t want to tell, so you should respect her wishes. Besides, she probably didn’t see any of the good parts.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“<em>What?</em>”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe sits up in outrage. She leaps upwards and flies towards my face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Ye think I did not witness the legends in person?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Well, you don’t want to say. So I just assumed—”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Fool! I was there when the boy became a king! I witnessed the instant the true king fell, and I have seen countless miracles besides! I saw the three kings die to each of Lugaid’s spears! How dare ye!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m just saying, you talk big, but if you’d care to share a story that you remember—”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Hah! I will recount to you a legend beyond all else!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe flies into the air and raises her voice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Behold! I will tell you for the one true king of Camelot! His sword still sits in Avalon, waiting for his hand to draw the ancient blade! Listen well mortals!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All heads turn as the small faerie begins to declaim. She has an amazingly loud voice, and the story—</p>
<p>I’m going to get to hear King Arthur’s story. I feel like a kid again. This is amazing.. Erin gives me a delighted look, and I wink at her. What can I say?</p>
<p>I do know a bit about faeries. Or at least, this one in particular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day dawns bright and early. Or so I suppose. For once, I’m sleeping in.</p>
<p>So is Erin. And the rest of the guests in the inn for that matter. In fact, some are still snoring as I walk downstairs and find them lying on the tables or ground.</p>
<p>As it turned out, Ivolethe did know the stories of King Arthur, the entire story. The true story. And she told it to us last night, with many dramatic flourishes and a whole host of embellishments it’s true, but it was true. Every word of it. Faeries don’t lie, and to look at Ivolethe as she was speaking was to believe.</p>
<p>It was true. And if I were an author I would have tried to capture every word she spoke on paper. Or maybe that would have been an impossible task, because her story was one of the greats.</p>
<p>In the end, we just all fell asleep listening to the tragic end of the tale of the King of Knights. His kingdom in ruins, his knights dying on the field, and only the hope of his eventual return to keep spirits strong in the dark times to come. Thus, the King of Camelot closes his eyes and breathes his final breath.</p>
<p>And here I thought I was being smart by ripping off the poets of my age. No wonder faeries looked down on us mortals for not creating stories that can match that level. If you’ve got forever to live, your standards for good storytelling rise accordingly.</p>
<p>Of course, that was last night. In the light of the day, all I want is for a hot meal before I go running. But with Erin so tired, that might be asking too much.</p>
<p>She has [Advanced Cooking] as a skill, but apparently you need to be at least moderately conscious to make it work. Or else not even that skill can fix dumping a bag full of flour onto an iron griddle. At least I got the pan off the fire before the flour combusted.</p>
<p>Mandatory near-death experience for the day completed, I finally make myself eggs and let Erin snore in the kitchen. I open the door—</p>
<p>And find Ivolethe waiting outside. The faerie grins at me, hovering in the crisp winter air. Honestly, I hadn’t even realized she’d left when I dragged myself into my room upstairs.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe. How are you doing?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Well, mortal!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She flies immediately to my shoulder and lands on it. Then she fidgets, and flies up to my head. I stare up at her dangling legs and sigh. But I make no comment.</p>
<p>As I begin to walk down the street a tiny frozen leg kicks me on the temple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“So, what are ye doing today? More staring at books and cursing? Or will ye run about like a snail once again?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If you’re bored, you can leave. You don’t have to follow me all the time.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Bah. I might miss something interesting. Besides, there is much to do that will amuse me in the meantime.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shrug, but feel a bit better. I try not to smile so openly; it doesn’t feel natural.</p>
<p>“Suit yourself.”</p>
<p>It’s a short jog to the Runner’s Guild, but I pause at the door. Ivolethe senses my intentions and tenses, but she makes no move to get off my head.</p>
<p>“I’m going inside. Do you want to wait somewhere else?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I will stay right here.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The iron won’t bother you?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Not overmuch. It is simply a shackle indoors, not a needle in the skin. Even if it feels so.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huh. I wonder how uncomfortable it is? Are faeries allergic to the metal, or is it like kryptonite?</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to go inside, that’s fine with me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I shall stay.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“No, I really don’t think you should go inside.”</p>
<p>After her last interaction with people other than Erin and me, I really have a bad feeling about letting Ivolethe inside a building. But she bends down to glare at me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I insist! I do not fear the iron!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sigh. For a being that calls herself my friend, Ivolethe doesn’t seem capable of yielding on any point. Or maybe she considers her stubbornness part of friendship.</p>
<p>“Just don’t cause trouble, okay? And…can I persuade you to hide in my belt pouch?”</p>
<p>The faerie is silent on my head for a few seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Mayhap. Is there food in the pouch?”</span><br>
“Let me get some.”</p>
<p>That was how I found myself stuffing fried meat and sticky-sweet jam buns into a belt pouch, much to Ivolethe’s muffled delight as I walked into the Runner’s Guild. I close the pouch; Ivolethe assured me she wouldn’t suffocate inside if I did, and I’m honestly not sure if faeries breathe.</p>
<p>I’ve got a Frost Faerie in my belt pouch. Well, there’s that. I walk into the Runner’s Guild and stop when I see a familiar face.</p>
<p>“Garia!”</p>
<p>The broad-shouldered girl turns and gives me a big smile. But then her expression changes to one of dismay.</p>
<p>“Ryoka? I didn’t know you were here…today.”</p>
<p>I walk forwards, frowning. Garia seems nervous. And then I look over her shoulder and see a crowd of people, Street and City Runners alike, clustered around one person. She has a familiar face. Sallow, I would call it, although pinched is the more accurate word.</p>
<p>“Persua.”</p>
<p>She’s standing in the center of the room, surrounded by a huge number of people—everyone in the Guild, in fact. Even the [Receptionists] have come out from behind their counters, and an older man is standing by Persua’s side. I think…he’s the Guildmaster. I don’t know. He normally never comes out of his small office.</p>
<p>Persua is basking in all the attention, talking loudly in her shrill voice and laughing often. When she laughs, the others laugh with her. It’s like how she normally interacts with her posse, but now everyone’s doing it. She’s so engrossed she hasn’t noticed me yet, and from the way Garia drags me to one side of the room, maybe that’s a good thing.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>I whisper to Garia as I look back at Persua. She doesn’t look that different—new clothes and running gear maybe, but she’s just the same unpleasant person who once had my leg crushed by a wagon. My fists itch to break a few of the bones in her face.</p>
<p>I don’t see Fals. He’s normally in the same room as Persua, mainly because she tends to follow him about wherever possible. He’s not here today, though, and his absence is somehow conspicuous.</p>
<p>“Ryoka, why are you here? Didn’t you hear what was happening today?”</p>
<p>“No, I did not.”</p>
<p>I frown at Garia as I take a seat at a far table from the group. No one tells me anything. Mainly because I don’t listen if it’s an invitation to hang out or hear the latest gossip. But this…I probably should have paid attention to.</p>
<p>“What’s going on, Garia?”</p>
<p>“It’s Persua. Today’s her going-away party. She’s going to move to Invrisil, or—some other city up north. She might come back this way, but she’s not going to be around here so everyone’s having a party for her!”</p>
<p>Persua? Going north? Best news I’ve heard all day, and I’m barely awake still. I smile at Garia with genuine pleasure.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with that? If she’s going, I’ll congratulate her as well and help her on the way out.”</p>
<p>Garia doesn’t grin at my response. She doesn’t like violence anyways, but she looks worried. There’s an odd emotion in her voice I can’t quite place. She lowers her voice even more.</p>
<p>“Ryoka…she’s going to be a <em>Courier.</em>”</p>
<p>“<em>What?</em>”</p>
<p>I can’t believe my ears. Persua? A Courier? She’s not nearly fast enough to be one. I should know—I saw Valceif and Hawk running, and they’re like lightning compared to <em>me.</em> Persua’s barely quick enough to be a City Runner, and she’s lazy to boot.</p>
<p>But Garia’s eyes are deadly serious as she nods. And I remember that moment where I swore she passed me on the road earlier—</p>
<p>No. It couldn’t be. Could it?</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“She leveled up and got a Skill, Ryoka! A rare one—she’s not even Level 20, I know that for a fact, but she learned a powerful movement Skill. Everyone heard about it! Ever since then, she’s been completing deliveries so fast none of us can keep up.”</p>
<p>A Skill. Of course. I feel a bit sick. Persua’s got terrible form, bad endurance, and she’s got no incentive to train or push herself. But give her a Skill and suddenly she can outrun anyone.</p>
<p>“Was it just luck? Or—how do you get Skills?”</p>
<p>Garia looks miserable as she shrugs. No, not just miserable. Jealous. That’s the emotion I’m seeing in her.</p>
<p>“Normally the good ones come up every ten levels. But you hear stories—some of it is chance, and Persua got lucky. Really lucky.”</p>
<p>“Okay, what skill did she get?”</p>
<p>“[Double Step]. It’s one of the core skills most Couriers have. That and [Quick Movement]—those were the ones Valceif had, remember? If you get those, people say you’re already two thirds of the way to becoming a Courier!”</p>
<p>Fuck. I remember Valceif running as if he was taking two strides for every one of mine. Garia’s right; get even one of those skills and there’s no Human from my world that could touch you. That is…completely unfair.</p>
<p>“Why’s she going north, then? It sounds like she could stay here and make a comfy living.”</p>
<p>“Well, Couriers make way more money and have more respect up north. And, Perusa <em>has </em>been doing just that! She’s completed almost half of the requests in the guild by herself. They’ll have to make her a Courier soon, or we’ll all be out of work!”</p>
<p>I drum my fingers on the table, good mood completely forgotten. Persua the Courier. I wanted to be one, but I can’t run fast enough. Valceif told me that I might be one if I proved myself, but Persua? Before me?</p>
<p>It’s really, really pissing me off. But—and I have to think of the plus side here, at least she won’t be bothering me again. And if she’s taking high-level requests, maybe someone will put a hit out on her and she’ll end up dead. I can only dream.</p>
<p>But for now, I think I’ll get out of the way before I have to deal with Persua again. I’m about to ask Garia if she wants to join me at Erin’s new inn so I can drink the bad taste from my mouth when Garia makes frantic gestures. I don’t even have to guess to know that Persua is coming my way; it just makes sense. When I step in crap while running, oftentimes there’s a second pile waiting for my other foot*.</p>
<p>*Translation: When it rains it pours. Plus, Persua’s a spiteful little monster, so she’ll take any opportunity to try and piss me off.</p>
<p>“Why Ryoka, I didn’t see you there! Come to congratulate me on my special day, have you?”</p>
<p>Garia freezes, and goes pale. I stare at her, considering my next move. I don’t turn around. I don’t change my expression.</p>
<p>“Hello, Persua.”</p>
<p>“Good morning to you too, Ryoka! How <em>are</em> you today? You were gone for so long in Liscor, I thought you were dead. But you aren’t. Did you get a lot of deliveries done while you were away? Or did you just like sleeping with non-Humans that much?”</p>
<p>Is that an insult? I shrug. I’m not giving Persua anything, even if she’s not apparently the best Runner around.</p>
<p>“I had fun.”</p>
<p>I still refuse to look her way. Persua’s shrill voice goes up an octave as she grows frustrated. She walks around me and I catch a glimpse of her pale, sharp features and her pursed lips that compliment her sour expression.</p>
<p>I don’t like her. I hate her guts. But I’m also smart enough to know that she’s goading me in her hour of triumph, hoping to get me in trouble. And you know what?</p>
<p>I’m not going to do a thing. It’s time for the ultimate Ryoka skill: acting impassive. Guaranteed to annoy anyone with an ego.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure if you’ve heard, but I’m going to be a Courier now. Isn’t that wonderful?”</p>
<p>The old man who’s probably the Guildmaster clears his throat nervously.</p>
<p>“Actually Persua, that’s not decided yet. You’re a wonderful Runner of course, but a Courier—”</p>
<p>He brakes off as Persua gives him a vicious look. She turns back and gives me a big, fake smile. I just grunt.</p>
<p>“What do you think, Ryoka? Won’t I be a wonderful Courier?”</p>
<p>“Mhm.”</p>
<p>She blinks at me, and then frowns. I look slowly around and see the other Runners standing and watching us. I know some of them by face, if not name. They’re City Runners, the people who band together and pat each other on the backs. They follow the leader or the fastest Runners, like Fals. Some of them are Persua’s people, but most are just like Garia; afraid to cross someone like Persua.</p>
<p>The others are Street Runners, desperate to suck up to anyone for a bit of help, a leg up, anything. They’re standing behind Persua as if they’re afraid she’ll blast them to ash if she gets unhappy. Garia is frozen in her seat, and I’m at the center of this maelstrom. No way out but deflection. Bring it on, Persua.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to say something to me? Before I go?”</p>
<p>“Not really.”</p>
<p>I wish I had a drink so I could sip it calmly. I study Garia’s face as Persua’s fake smile turns into a frown.</p>
<p>“You know, I saw you yesterday. Well, I think I saw you. You were moving so slow, I thought, ‘that can’t be <em>Ryoka</em>’. But you were gone so fast—it’s hard, being the fastest Runner around.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure it must be.”</p>
<p>Another scowl, covered up again. Persua might have all the abilities of a weasel, and the ability to backstab people and even orchestrate attacks, but she’s not that good at concealing her emotions.</p>
<p>“You know, I’ve been taking all of the deliveries recently. I just…do them. One after another. It’s so easy.”</p>
<p>Some of the City Runners shift at that, which makes me privately happy. They don’t like Persua much, and I’m sure they’ll be glad to see her back. But I don’t let my features change for an instant.</p>
<p>“Good for you.”</p>
<p>Persua grinds her teeth audibly. I keep my hands on the table, calm, cool, collected. I’m wondering if I can get her to storm off or throw the first punch. I would enjoy that.</p>
<p>But she doesn’t blow her lid. I see Persua pause, and then her eyes flick to the tabletop.</p>
<p>“I notice you’ve lost something. Did you leave your fingers behind on one of your runs?”</p>
<p>The other Runners go silent. I feel the spike of emotion in my stomach. My fingers. Garia gasps in horror as she notices them for the first time, but I refuse to react. I look at Persua coolly, meeting her evil little eyes.</p>
<p>“Are you going to stand around or do some deliveries, Persua? Because if you’re just going to stand around talking, then do it in another corner of the room.”</p>
<p>She blinks at me. I don’t blink back. I hold her gaze; I’ve beaten her in a staring contest before and I’d love to humble her again. But she doesn’t play my game. Instead, she smiles and looks back on me.</p>
<p>Crap. I shouldn’t have reacted. She knows I was annoyed. No help for it.</p>
<p>“I’m <em>so sorry</em> if my little party is bothering you. I suppose great City Runners like you are too busy to socialize, right? Too good for us lesser Runners?”</p>
<p>I shrug.</p>
<p>“Pretty much.”</p>
<p>Persua’s face goes flat, and little pinpoints of rage appear in her eyes. She smiles at me again.</p>
<p>“It’s just—and I know you don’t mean to be rude, but you are—you haven’t told me how happy you are. And I know you wouldn’t want to be rude, would you?”</p>
<p>She wants me to congratulate her? I meet her gaze steadily.</p>
<p>“Come on. Don’t you have anything to say?”</p>
<p>No. But she might go away. But no and never and not in a million years.</p>
<p>“Can’t hear me, Ryoka? Did you lose your ears as well as those fingers?”</p>
<p>“I heard you. Congratulations. Piss off.”</p>
<p>The words pop out before I can stop them. I hear an audible <em>gasp</em> from the peanut gallery, in more than one place, and some titters of laughter as well, quickly silenced. Persua’s pale face blushes and blotches in places.</p>
<p>That was a mistake. I just humiliated her, and instead of backing off, she’s going to try and make an example out of me rather than lose face. I know how the routine goes. I grit my teeth and wonder how I can deal with this.</p>
<p>Maybe if I just walk out? But no, she’ll just call that a win or block me from leaving. And I don’t run from bullies. Let’s see what she does next.</p>
<p>Persua looks around, and meets the eyes of some Runners around her. Her personal posse, the ones who kissed her ass even before she learned her fancy Skill. She jerks her head and they move out from the crowd. I count them. Four—six…seven…</p>
<p>“That is <em>such</em> a rude thing to say, Ryoka. And on my special day as well! Here I am, Courier-to-be and you—you’re just a Runner. I think you should apologize. In fact, I insist on it.”</p>
<p>Oh? She’s going to get her friends to beat me down? I’m impressed; most girls wait a few months before they get that nasty. But then, this is another world and Persua’s a demon wearing crappy skin.</p>
<p>The other Runners step back when they see what’s about to go down. The old man tries to interject, but his voice is wavering with nerves.</p>
<p>“Persua, I really think—”</p>
<p>Her head turns and the Guildmaster goes silent. I feel a moment of sympathy for him; he’s probably not going to get much respect once she goes. Everyone’s going to remember how she walked all over him. But then I remember that he’s supposed to be in charge, and that he’s a coward. The other runners flank me, as if they’re a local mafia boss’s thugs and I’m the cringing victim.</p>
<p>“Well? I’m waiting for my apology.”</p>
<p>Persua faces me, supremely confident because she’s got a few Runners behind her. Oh come on. They don’t even have combat classes, most of them! I’m taller than all but one of the guys, and she’s seen me take down a Bronze-rank adventurer.</p>
<p>Okay, there are ten of them. Plus Persua. But I’ve changed a bit since we last met as well. The first day I found Erin, I had Octavia refill all of my potions and alchemical bags. I’ve got two of everything ready to go, and I know several magic tricks as well.</p>
<p>I keep still. Not exactly a power play, but I’m not going to react to her stupid little posse.</p>
<p>“I’m not apologizing for anything. And if you don’t get your obnoxious little cronies out of my face, they’re all going to suffer.”</p>
<p>Of all the things I know Persua was expecting, she wasn’t expecting <em>that.</em> Her face goes slack, and I feel the people around me shift. Garia’s looking at me as if I’m insane and trying to signal me to say I’m sorry, but I’m calm.</p>
<p>If they want a fight, I’m completely ready. Persua might have a Skill that makes her faster, but I’d love to see if she can dodge a pepper potion to the face. If she tries anything I’ll use [Flashbang] and then hold her down while I pour the potion in her eyes. I’m just hoping she takes the bait.</p>
<p>She doesn’t. Persua eyes me, her companions, and then decides not to risk it. She tosses her head and turns away.</p>
<p>“You’re not even worth my time.”</p>
<p>“Coward.”</p>
<p>I toss the insult at her back and see it stiffen. I don’t know why I said it; my mouth just won’t stop in situations like this. Persua turns back, a smile full of hate on her face. We don’t even try to pretend towards civility now.</p>
<p>“Fingerless insect. My back is all you’ll see of me from now on.”</p>
<p>“Beats looking at your face.”</p>
<p>“How many mutts and lizards did you sleep with in Liscor?”</p>
<p>“Oh you know, one or two. More people than you’ll ever sleep with in your life.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t touch one of those mongrels or scaly freaks with a stick.”</p>
<p>“They’d just run away screaming when they saw your face.”</p>
<p>“Whore.”</p>
<p>“Bitch.”</p>
<p>“You’ll be stuck here forever, you pathetic, classless slug.”</p>
<p>“And you’ll never be a proper Courier in a thousand years.”</p>
<p>We meet eyes for one last moment, and then Persua turns away. I let her walk to the other side of the room, followed by the group and don’t make any move until she’s laughing loudly with them and not looking at me. Then I sigh and turn back to Garia. She looks like she’s swallowed her tongue.</p>
<p>Well, that was fun. Now I’ve got to warn Erin about Persua as well.</p>
<p>I hate my life.</p>
<p>“I’m out of here. Garia, do you want to join me in the Frenzied Hare? I could use a drink.”</p>
<p>Garia starts and stammers as she looks at me.</p>
<p>“I uh—I—”</p>
<p>She doesn’t want to get on Persua’s bad side. Fine. I sigh and stand up. My heart is pounding fast, but I got the better of Persua in that one. No matter how hard she laughs—</p>
<p>I’m halfway across the smooth wood floor when I sense a blur. Persua seems to <em>blink</em> across the room, and then I feel her foot tangle with mine. She moves too fast for me to react; I trip forwards—</p>
<p>And catch myself, thanks to an ungainly wind milling of arms. I’ve been tripped before, and I’ve got a good stance. Nevertheless, I stumble forwards and hear Persua’s mocking laughter.</p>
<p>“How clumsy of you. What happened, Ryoka?”</p>
<p>I turn and look at her. She’s smirking off to one side, daring me to say something. I consider my options, and decide it’s not worth it. That’s her small victory; if she does it again she’s dead.</p>
<p>I walk on, adjusting my belt pouch. Persua’s still laughing, but I just make sure she didn’t grab anything from me. Potions? Check. Teriarch’s bag of holding? Check. Belt pouches?</p>
<p>One of the pouches is undone. I feel at it, and find cold, greasy meat and jam-covered crumbs in the pouch. Nothing else. My heart skips a beat. I whirl around—</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Vengeance!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The shout springs from the tiny Frost Faerie that flies at Persua’s face. The girl only has a moment to scream before Ivolethe is all over her. The faerie flies around Persua, shouting triumphantly as Persua screams and people shout in surprise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Take this! And suffer that, ye mortal wench!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She rips at Persua’s hair, tearing out strands and bites and scratches at Persua’s face. The girl is screaming, flailing at the small creature, but Ivolethe is everywhere. But then Persua’s hand connects with the faerie by pure chance, and Ivolethe is flung to the ground.</p>
<p>“What is it? Kill it!”</p>
<p>Persua shrills as another Runner dashes forwards and scoops Ivolethe up. She yells at him and tries to bite, but he has a finger under her chin. Everyone goes silent as they see for the first time what Ivolethe is.</p>
<p>“What creature is this?”</p>
<p>“Is it—it’s not a monster? A Fraerling? It’s too pale! And it has wings!”</p>
<p>“Let her go.”</p>
<p>I stride forwards, but Persua and her cronies immediately block my way. She stares at me, blood dripping from the scratches on her face and the places where Ivolethe yanked away skin as well as hair.</p>
<p>“<em>You </em>did this.”</p>
<p>I ignore Persua and look at the Runner holding her. He’s uncertain, but his grip on Ivolethe is strong and no matter how hard she struggles, she clearly can’t break free. And neither is she freezing him either; she must not be able to without her magic.</p>
<p>“That’s not a monster. That’s a Frost Faerie. Let her go, now.”</p>
<p>“A <em>Winter Sprite?</em>”</p>
<p>He looks at Ivorethe, stunned. She tries to move her head, but his fingernail is under her chin. She glares and dripples spit onto his thumb, but that’s all she can do.</p>
<p>“Kill it.”</p>
<p>Persua hisses at the other Runner. He hesitates. My heart constricts, and I raise my voice.</p>
<p>“Harm her, and I will kill you. My word on it.”</p>
<p>The Runner looks back to me. He’s one of Persua’s flunkies, but I know my eyes are serious. I mean every word. Persua looks at me, and then at the faerie. Then she smiles evilly.</p>
<p>“Is this your friend? Do you have to make friends with monsters since no one else likes you?”</p>
<p>I ignore Persua and hold out a hand.</p>
<p>“Give her to me.”</p>
<p>“Don’t listen to her.”</p>
<p>Persua interposes herself between the Runner and me. She gestures, and now her posse steps around me. I don’t even look at them; my eyes are on Ivolethe.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen a Winter Sprite before. Is this what they really look like? They must be the rarest of all monsters; how did you catch this one?”</p>
<p>I try to tune out Persua’s words. What can I do? If I grab for her, what if Ivorlethe gets hurt? How can I talk Persua down peacefully? No—it’s the Runner who’s got her. Focus on him.</p>
<p>But Persua blocks my view of the Runner. She looks at me, and now I see the hatred shining in her eyes, pure and simple. She turns to look at the other Runners.</p>
<p>“Have any of you ever heard of a Frost Faerie being captured? No? I bet that if we sold her to a [Merchant] or an [Alchemist], they’d pay hundreds, no, <em>thousands</em> of gold coins for her.”</p>
<p>The Runners around me shift. The mention of that kind of money changes their eyes, and some of them slowly walk over to the crowd around me.</p>
<p>Shit. This is bad. But I have to let Ivolethe get free. I look past Persua and raise my voice.</p>
<p>“If you harm her, you will suffer for it. I don’t care how many people you’ve got; I’m not letting you take her. She’s a living being.”</p>
<p>“She <em>attacked</em> me!”</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>Persua <em>hisses</em> with fury. She takes a step forwards, and her arm jostles the Runner holding her. Instantly, Ivolethe shouts, her voice ringing in the Guild.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“<em>Sisters! Sisters, hear me call and take retribution—</em>”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her voice cuts off as the Runner reapplies pressure on her chin. But the damage is done. I see the other Runners looking nervous and try to capitalize on that.</p>
<p>“Did you hear that? She just shouted for her sisters. You’ve seen the Frost Faeries and what they do when they’re mad. What do you think will happen if you kill one of their own?”</p>
<p><em>That</em> makes the Runners think twice. Some of them shift and edge back a bit. No one wants to suffer the vengeance of creatures that bring the winter, no matter how much they might earn.</p>
<p>Persua looks uneasy too, but she’s too stupid to think straight. She whirls and screeches at the Runner.</p>
<p>“Shut her up! Squash her already!”</p>
<p>“Don’t do it.”</p>
<p>The Runner holding Ivolethe hesitates. His hand shakes and the faerie is gasping, but he doesn’t let go. I step forwards.</p>
<p>“Let her go. Now.”</p>
<p>“You coward! Give it to me! I’ll do it!”</p>
<p>Persua’s patience snaps. She reaches for Ivolethe, but the Runner pulls away from her as well. I step forwards again, thinking he’s seen reason, but he raises her up. I halt, hand outstretched. Persua stares at the Runner, eyes flinty daggers.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>He licks his lips. But he’s staring at me now. He opens his mouth and croaks a word.</p>
<p>“Coin.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You—you want her back, you’ve got to pay for her.”</p>
<p>I stare at him incredulously. He can’t be serious. But oh, yes, he is. He pauses again, but he holds onto Ivolethe tightly as he looks at me.</p>
<p>“We all know you’ve got a lot. Well—give it over. And then I’ll let her go. Otherwise—”</p>
<p>He squeezes a little harder and Ivolethe cries out. My blood boils, but Persua’s all smiles now.</p>
<p>“That’s right! Just hand over your belt pouches—and your potions—and we’ll call it even. Okay?”</p>
<p>Those greedy bastards. But the Runner’s eyes are serious, and Ivolethe is in pain. What should I do? If I give them Teriarch’s gold coins—but Ivolethe—</p>
<p>I stare at Persua. I stare at the Runner. I stare at Ivolethe, and come to a swift decision.</p>
<p>“Fuck it. <em>[Flashbang]!</em>”</p>
<p>The world and sound itself explode into confusion and chaos. I closed my eyes, but the sound wave still hits me like a physical thing. My ears ring and go silent; but I’m already charging into the Runner, body-checking him to the floor.</p>
<p>There’s no time for thought or anything else. I reach for his flailing hands. I have to get Ivolethe free. Get her loose. Grab his arms. Break his bones. Bite his fingers off. I punch him repeatedly as I search for the small blue shape among the dancing spots in my vision. Where is she?</p>
<p>Nowhere. Gone. She’s free! I see a blue shape flying towards the door, and then someone strikes me from behind.</p>
<p>Persua is on top of me, fingers clawing, biting, kicking. She’s like a wildcat, and some of her friends try to batter me as well. I roll over, and pull out one of Octavia’s potions.</p>
<p>The pepper potion would be better as a spray. But one good toss still gets it on a lot of faces and eyes, including Persua’s. I shield my face and feel the hot liquid stinging as it reacts with my skin, but the screams are worth it. I stumble up and see Persua stumbling away from me, shrieking as she rubs at her eyes.</p>
<p>Something in me snaps. Her little insults, her tripping me, my crushed leg—and Ivolethe—all explode outwards in a fist that catches her on the cheek and sends her to the ground. Persua tries to get up, but I kick her down and then mount her as she flails and begin to punch.</p>
<p>Punch her. Hurt her. My ears are ringing, but now I hear the roaring of blood, and all that I want in this or any other world is to bash her face in. I hit and hit and hit, until something drags me back. I struggle, fighting, but whoever’s holding me is too strong.</p>
<p>The rage hammering every inch of me subsides after a while, and I stop struggling. That’s when I hear and see and think again, and realize I’m being held by two strong arms.</p>
<p>“Garia?”</p>
<p>I look around and see my friend, her nose bleeding furiously, holding me back as Persua lies on the floor. People are still shouting in pain—I see Runners clutching at their eyes and more raising their voices, deafened. Two people are with Persua, and then I see the girl herself lying on the ground.</p>
<p>Her face is—I only now begin to feel the pain in my hands. My fingers hurt terribly, and I feel small lacerations and bruising on my skin. I see the echoes of their impressions on Persua’s face.</p>
<p>It’s already swollen. I can barely see her features, and there’s blood. A lot of blood. I broke her nose, even parts of her face. She’s crying, and shaking, and the [Receptionist] holding the healing potion barely knows where to start. But as the swelling reduces a tiny bit, one of her eyes swivels towards me. And I hear her voice.</p>
<p>“You.”</p>
<p>She struggles, but the two women hold her down. Persua’s face is filled with blood and snot and tears and who knows what else. But her voice is intact. It’s a trembling mess of emotions; not a shriek, but a warbling, piercing whisper.</p>
<p>“I’ll kill you.”</p>
<p>I’m near enough to Persua that I can feel her spitting as her malformed lips form the words. Her eyes fix on me, wild, and the words pour forth, hatred in each syllable. Tears run through the blood on her face, but she still stares at me.</p>
<p>“I’ll kill you. I swear it. I’ll have you raped and killed. You’ll die <em>screaming.</em>”</p>
<p>“Ryoka—”</p>
<p>Garia tries to pull me back, and the [Receptionists] try to force us apart. But Persua thrashes and I refuse to move. She screams.</p>
<p>“I’ll <em>kill you! You’ll die horribly! There won’t be pieces left of you! I’ll kill you and everyone you love, you—</em>”</p>
<p>The [Receptionist] tries to jam the potion in her mouth, but Persua just spits out a broken tooth with the potion as she continues shouting at me.</p>
<p>There’s a crazy look in her eyes. Garia holds me back as I stare at Persua. She continues speaking, half-sobbing, half-cursing. There’s nothing I can say to her, nothing to reply with. So I just kick her in the stomach and watch her puke before Garia pulls me away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two hours later, I stand outside in the cold snow. I barely feel it, even though I haven’t had any of Erin’s soup. I feel the cold air blowing my clothes and don’t care.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe.”</p>
<p>The faerie hovers in the air next to me, looking uncharacteristically serious. I’m dressed up, and she’s naked. But I feel like the colder one. My heart is very cold. Very still.</p>
<p>I slowly sit down in the snow, and the faerie flies down next to me. The snow is wet—I don’t care. I don’t have anywhere to be, and I can’t stand. Not right now.</p>
<p>After a while, the faerie speaks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“‘Twas an unexpected encounter, was it not?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look at her. Ivolethe looks back.</p>
<p>“What the hell am I supposed to say to that?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I am not sure. But did it end how you expected?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I laugh, shortly.</p>
<p>“What do you think? I’m <em>banned </em>from that Runner’s Guild—maybe all of them right now. They might press charges, or make me pay for what’s left of the building.”</p>
<p>Shortly after I left, the other Frost Faeries appeared. They crashed an avalanche of snow into the building. If it hadn’t been deserted—as it was, it destroyed nearly everything inside. The last I saw, the building was so full of snow that people were having to chip away at the compacted ice.</p>
<p>“What a mess.”</p>
<p>The short version of what went down is that Persua went to the best local Healer around to get treated for the injuries the potion couldn’t fix. The Runners scattered, mostly thanks to the other Frost Faeries pelting them with shards of ice, freezing them, and so on. I think the Guild staff would have liked to hold me accountable, but when they saw the faeries literally destroy the entire Guild in one go, they had second thoughts. So did the Watch, which is how I found myself politely asked to leave the city <em>now </em>rather than be kicked out.</p>
<p>I probably could have stayed. But I didn’t want to be anywhere near Persua, not even in the same city. I still remember the look in her eyes.</p>
<p>It’s not over. I’ve never seen anyone look like that, but I know without a doubt that she meant every word she said to me. Part of me wishes I’d gone back and taken my knife and stabbed her right there and then. She’s never going to forget. But I’m not a murderer.</p>
<p>No matter how close I got back there.</p>
<p>“What a mess. What a horrible, terrible…”</p>
<p>The faerie looks up at me. I stare down at her. In a way, this is all her fault. Persua would have left me alone if I’d just walked on. But I can’t hate her for what she did. It’s what I’d do for Erin, the exact same.</p>
<p>“From now on, I’m not taking you inside ever again. Got it?”</p>
<p>She nods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“That is fair.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shiver. Now I’m feeling the cold again, but I stay seated, cross-legged.</p>
<p>“I’m just glad you’re okay. If that Runner or Persua had tried—would they have killed you?”</p>
<p>Another nod.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Better that you had let them. If she had slain me, her death would have followed before the next moon rose in the sky.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chill from within, chill without. I stare at Ivolethe.</p>
<p>“Who would have killed her? The other faeries?”</p>
<p>She shakes her tiny head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Not my sisters, no. There are others among the Winter Court who move in matters of death. And they are far more terrible than we.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t want to know. I don’t. Ivolethe’s face—I don’t want to know. Some things about the fae terrify me.</p>
<p>“It’s better that you didn’t die.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Perhaps. But that girl—she swore a dire oath against you. Such things can only be resolved in blood.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You’re probably right.”</p>
<p>I know she is. But I can’t think about that now. I can’t, or I’ll have to choose between killing her now or—</p>
<p>“She’ll be a Courier. And I won’t see her.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Bah. That one would give up all for vengeance. Her blades will find you no matter how far apart ye are.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I guess I’ve just got to outrun her, then. Although she’s faster than I am now.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Mm.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We sit in silence for a while longer. I bow my head. Ivolethe just looks at the still landscape.</p>
<p>“I was jealous of her, you know. Just a bit. I don’t like Skills and Classes but—I’m so slow and weak without them.”</p>
<p>Ivolethe looks up at me silently. I avert my gaze; look at the gray horizon as I try to explain.</p>
<p>“It’s always the same argument. I think I’m giving away something by leveling up. Or—or I’m compromising, taking the easy route to success without any effort. But there <em>is</em> effort required, and what’s the harm in doing what everyone else is doing? It’s only logical.”</p>
<p>More silence. Ivolethe just listens as I externalize my struggle and confess.</p>
<p>“But it’s hard. I want to be strong. Erin’s—she’s stronger than me in so many ways. But I thought that would be fine. I could do things my own way, become a Courier even—I had Octavia’s potions, and I can even do magic. But it turns out I can’t even do magic that well.”</p>
<p>Some snow blows off of the ground and into the air. I watch it whirl upwards and away.</p>
<p>“I can’t do magic. And I’ve hit my limit physically. I could—try altering my body, I guess. Teriarch mentioned that. But that’s cheating too. I just wish there was a way to be faster. Just faster. If I were faster, I’d be happy with the rest.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“So what is it ye wish?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe turns to face me in the snow. I look down at her, and feel that same sense of envy.</p>
<p>“I wish I was better. Just…better.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“‘Tis a tall wish. Even a King could not grant your request. Why not be content with your self as it is now? You are brave and quick; is there aught else you need?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know she’s right, but at the same time, she’s wrong. I shake my head and shiver.</p>
<p>“Who I am isn’t enough. I want to become more. Is that too much to ask?”</p>
<p>For a while Ivolethe studies me. Then she smiles, teeth flashing in the winter sunlight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“It is. But mortals have always wished for such. That is why you spread like wildfire while we remain, timeless.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She looks rueful and sad, and happy at the same time, like an adult watching a child play. My heart aches.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to do. What would you do, in my place, Ivolethe?”</p>
<p>She looks at me from head to toe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“What is it you’ve dreamed of, Ryoka Griffin? What do you wish for with all your heart?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s an important question, but I know the answer in a second. I just have to think back to the day I started running. I speak my reply to her and the cold.</p>
<p>“I always wanted to run like the wind. I felt it once, when you led me and Mrsha away from the Goblin army.”</p>
<p>I remember the rushing air behind me, and the sense of weightlessness I felt. Each step was forever, and I watched the world fly past me. For a second I was wind, and I lived my dream.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Well then, I would search for that. I would seek to run as the wind, for that is my dream. If I did not chase such things, I would not be mortal, no?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>I have to laugh.</p>
<p>“Even a Courier couldn’t run like that. At least, not Val or Hawk. And certainly not without levels. How would I ever get that fast, when I can’t even outrun <em>Persua?</em>”</p>
<p>Ivolethe spreads two tiny hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“We are friends, are we not? What do friends do but help each other?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She grins at me again, and I pause.</p>
<p>“What? How could you help?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“You want to study magic? To become better? I told you once; you will not find what you look for in a book. But perhaps it is because ye haven’t seen what magic truly is.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know what she’s hinting at. But I have to hear it out loud.</p>
<p>“What are you suggesting?”</p>
<p>Slowly, Ivolethe flies upwards until she sits in the air in front of me. She looks me in the eye, still smiling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I’ll teach you the ways of the fae, not the tricks mortals use. I will teach you to listen to the wind and run like we do. That is what a friend does for a poor mortal who wishes to be better than she is.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My heart is thundering. My breath catches in my throat.</p>
<p>“Can you do that? Isn’t it against the rules?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“No one has made rules against this. No one has been mad enough to try. But for you, friend, I would try. It’s worth a shot, eh?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look at her. Ivolethe grins at me, a tiny, mad faerie. My friend. I stare back at her, a shivering, depressed Human girl who dreams of flying. Slowly, I offer her a hand.</p>
<p>“If you’d be crazy enough to try it, I’d be forever in your debt.”</p>
<p>Ivolethe wrinkles her face in disgust and slaps away my hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Bah. Do not make such promises so lightly. Nae, I offer you this: I will try to teach you to run like the wind for one thing.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Name it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Friendship.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She offers me a tiny hand. I don’t hesitate. I reach out, and her grip is like melting ice, winter’s thaw, the moment of tiny warmth in the frozen heart of the world. We shake, and it is done.</p>
<p>A faerie’s bargain. A friend’s promise. A child’s dream.</p>
<p>The wind blows, and my heart races off with it.</p>
<p>To run like the wind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The day after Ryoka’s encounter with Persua and the day before everything else happened, a [Message] was sent to Celum addressed to Ryoka and Erin. Two spells, actually. They were duly recorded and when Ryoka remembered to stop by the Mage’s Guild, they were delivered to both girls at the counter with no incident.</p>
<p>Erin and Ryoka stared at the short piece of paper and the neat, clearly legible handwriting of the scribe. It was a short message, but hit all the points Erin had been privately worrying about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Erin, Mrsha is with me and Olesm is keeping an eye on your inn. M is worried, but adjusting. All is well; do not get stabbed by Goblins. I have told Klbksctch and Relc. Stay safe,</em></p>
<p><em>–Selys.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Erin breathed a sigh of relief as she looked at the message while Ryoka looked at the short reply she’d received from Krshia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>We will await the delivery. The others will abide until then.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other girl didn’t exactly sigh in relief, but it put her mind at ease. Both young women left the Mage’s Guild without sending a return message, and met with Ivolethe and Garia to go about the rest of their day. While the situation was not ideal, Erin and Ryoka agreed that things would keep a little while before they would need to return.</p>
<p>However, all those in both Celum and Liscor had omitted one person in their exchange of messages. Selys had completely forgotten about her while attempting to deal with a restless and upset Mrsha, and Krshia was too busy taking care of her nephew Brunkr, who was lying in bed moaning about his paw. Erin was too busy thinking about Toren to remember, and Ryoka didn’t really care. Thus, no one had mentioned the last small detail left unresolved in Erin’s inn.</p>
<p>They had all completely forgotten about Lyonette.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lyonette sat in the empty inn that belonged to Erin Solstice and stared at the shuttered windows. It was dark. The room was empty and quiet and the falling snow outside did not disturb the suffocating <em>stillness</em> of the building. Nevertheless, Lyonette stayed still, refusing to move. She was not crying, and she wasn’t having hysterics. She was above such common reactions.</p>
<p>But she was afraid. She could see snow falling between one of the cracks in the shutters. It was the only one not fully covering the glass windows. She knew she should get up and close it fully, but she didn’t want to. Fear held her down.</p>
<p>Lyonette, or Lyon as she now grudgingly answered to, watched the snow slowly build up outside. Flakes fell down from the overcast sky, disappearing into the blank landscape. She watched the snow fall and wondered when it would stop. Part of her wanted it never to stop, as if time was tied to the snow. So long as it fell, time wouldn’t pass and she wouldn’t have to confront the truth.</p>
<p>Erin Solstice was gone. She had left her inn one day and never come back. She was gone, and now so was the cute little Gnoll child named Mrsha. Ryoka Griffin, the surly Runner girl had left too, and all the guests had stopped arriving. Now the inn was deserted, save for Lyonette. And if the Goblins came back, she would just be a corpse. Or worse.</p>
<p>In the growing cold, Lyonette shivered. She hadn’t dared light a fire, even though the winter chill meant she had bundled herself in every article of clothing Erin had given her. She had even dragged a blanket downstairs and she was shivering in it. She could see her breath sometimes in the air—if she held her breath and then slowly breathed out, she could see it as a small vapor trail.</p>
<p>This was a new discovery for Lyonette. She had seldom been in any place where she was this cold for this long. She had always been taken care of by a bevy of servants; exposure to potentially lethal cold like this was unthinkable.</p>
<p>But her servants were on another continent and Lyonette was alone. And Erin, the only person who had taken care of her, was gone. She might have been killed by the Goblin army. They had gone north, hadn’t they?</p>
<p>At that thought Lyonette shuddered uncontrollably and nearly fell out of her chair. The Goblin army. They had come through Liscor’s path, a huge army of them, just like those led by the Goblin Lords of the past. She hadn’t seen anything like a Goblin Lord, but the army had been enough to give her waking nightmares.</p>
<p>She remembered that night vividly. She had been sleeping in her bed the day after Selys had taken Mrsha. Lyonette hadn’t been sleeping well; she’d barely gotten to bed after the female drake had finally dragged the Gnoll forcibly out of the inn, ignoring the <em>howls</em> and shrieks of distress the Gnoll cub had made. And then she had heard the high-pitched shouting, and woken from her slumber. A minute later Lyonette had realized it wasn’t shouting she was hearing, but the Goblins.</p>
<p>An army had marched out of the darkness, through the falling snow, hundreds, thousands of them. Some had been holding torches, but the vast mass of their number had been mostly shadows, rapidly traversing the deep snow, laughing and <em>shrieking</em> as the torchlight glinted off of metal.</p>
<p>A Goblin army. The bane of civilization. Lyonette had been too afraid to count and see if there were really hundreds of thousands of them like those that had marched in the last Goblin King’s army. The instant she had realized the Goblins were moving towards Liscor, she had barricaded the door and fled upstairs to her room.</p>
<p>Lyon had hid in her room on the second floor of the inn, hiding under the bed with her heart hammering out of her chest as she heard the Goblin host marching past. Her first thought had been that the Goblins were attacking Liscor. But they hadn’t. Instead, the Goblin army had moved around the city on the eastern side. They were headed north, to the Human lands, and that had forced them to bypass Liscor.</p>
<p>The Goblins had passed by the walls of the city in one mass, loosing arrows up at the defenders while the [Guardsmen] held their ground behind the battlements. A few volleys had been loosed in return, but the main deterrent had come in the form of a glowing orb of crackling lightning that had formed over the southern wall. It had sent bolts of lightning shooting down towards the Goblins, who had scattered and retreated to a safer distance.</p>
<p>Lyonette had recognized the wards of course. They were standard among most large cities that faced regular monster attacks. And they were a sufficient deterrent for the Goblin army, for the mass of monsters didn’t stop to retaliate again and disappeared down the northern road. Lyonette had watched the dark shapes vanish and waited even longer until the last eerie howls had been covered up by silence. But she had hid in the inn until the morning, and many hours after that.</p>
<p>After that—silence. Lyonette had stayed in the inn for two more days, only opening the door once when a strange Drake she vaguely recognized tried to enter. He hadn’t said much—his name was Okresm or something and he had left as soon as he realized Lyon was still living here. Rather, she had chased him out.</p>
<p>Now Lyonette was regretting that, however slightly. It had been days since the Goblin army had passed, and the young woman had heard nothing about Erin’s whereabouts. For all intents and purposes, she had vanished.</p>
<p>What had happened? Ryoka had left with a few curt words saying she was going to look for Erin. Then Selys had decided to take Mrsha into the city and they’d gone. And then—</p>
<p>Nothing. Where was Erin? Had Ryoka found her, or was she still looking? Lyonette was in the dark about everything, and with only her fears to speak to her day after day, her paranoia had mounted.</p>
<p>Erin was never coming back. She might be, but she could be hurt, or wounded. What if a monster had killed her, or her skeleton? Maybe it had shown its true colors and stabbed her when her back was turned, or simply abandoned Erin in the middle of nowhere. She could be dead! Or eaten! Or—</p>
<p>Lyonette imagined Goblins doing all the horrible things her [Governess] had told her about, or what she’d heard when eavesdropping on the palace staff. Erin might have run into the Goblin army. She could be dying right this instant.</p>
<p>That didn’t inspire Lyon to go out searching for Erin like that rude Ryoka had done of course. She wouldn’t know where to begin, and the Goblins had probably eaten her. Besides, Lyon didn’t owe her anything. Erin Solstice was a rude peasant who treated no one with respect and was too trusting for her own good. Anything that befell her was probably her own fault.</p>
<p>But Lyonette had to admit, the inn had never seemed so dark when Erin Solstice was around. And it had never been quite so…</p>
<p>Empty.</p>
<p>It was as if the life of the inn itself had gone with Erin. The day after she’d left, all the guests had stopped arriving. That may have had to do with the Goblins and the lack of any lights in the windows—Lyonette had stopped lighting the fire in the common room of the inn—but in an instant, the bustle of the building had ceased completely.</p>
<p>At first Lyonette had been impatient, waiting for Erin’s return. Then she had been afraid. Now, after many days, she was just…quiet. Lyonette sat in the inn day after day, only leaving now and then to fetch some water to drink or use the outhouse. But the longer she sat in the dead building, the more she knew something had to change.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a quick realization. If anything, it was a thought born out of several nights of sleeping with her back to the door, wide-eyed, flinching at any random sound in the night. It was finding Erin’s little money stash and realizing most of her gold coins had been given away to the Horns of Hammerad or on Erin’s person when she disappeared. It was staring at the empty pantry and feeling the small hole in her stomach where food should and always had been.</p>
<p>Lyonette had cried herself to sleep the first night she’d gone to sleep with her belly writhing with hunger; the next she’d just slept, too exhausted to even weep. Six days after Erin had vanished, Lyonette knew what had to be done. She looked up and watched another wisp of warmth vanish into the dark room of The Wandering Inn. She knew.</p>
<p>Erin Solstice wasn’t coming back. Or if she was, it might be tomorrow, a week from now, or months. Either way, if she was gone for even a little while longer, it would be too late. So. Lyonette knew what had to be done while Erin was gone.</p>
<p>She had to work. Or she would starve.</p>
<p>It was a foreign concept to Lyon in many ways, a hateful one. Demeaning. But it didn’t change the facts. She was running out of Erin’s coin, and she had even less food in the building. She had to work. Erin’s inn had sustained itself by selling food to customers; she had to continue that.</p>
<p>There were no other options Lyonette could think of. She couldn’t envision herself making her way north through the snow, and the Goblins—no. And she was banned from the city, so that left only the inn.</p>
<p>Again, this wasn’t a conclusion Lyonette came to willingly, but after two days of eating the last crumbs of frozen cheese and equally hard bread that was the last of the food in the pantry, Lyonette was desperate. That was how she found herself waiting at the door when Olesm, the Drake, cautiously broke his way through the snow to her inn.</p>
<p>“You! You there, Drake!”</p>
<p>He nearly jumped out of his scales when Lyonette threw the door open. She had seen the Drake come by the inn every day, or every other day at the latest. He usually just peered hopefully through one of the windows for a few minutes before leaving, usually quicker if he saw her face.</p>
<p>“Oh. It’s you. Um, Lyon, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>Lyonette gave the Drake a big smile and deliberately refrained from correcting him on her proper name.</p>
<p>“That is right. And you are…Olesm, correct?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>The Drake coughed and looked into the dark inn hopefully.</p>
<p>“Is uh, Erin not back yet?”</p>
<p>“No. She hasn’t returned.”</p>
<p>“Ah. I see.”</p>
<p>The Drake hesitated.</p>
<p>“Well, I won’t be getting in your way. I’ll ah, drop by tomorrow, then.”</p>
<p>“No! Don’t do that! I mean—why don’t you stay here?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Lyonette opened the door a bit wider. The Drake blinked into the dark room, and Lyonette realized that he probably couldn’t even see inside.</p>
<p>“It’s a bit dark, but I’ll start the fire. You can stay and—and order something!”</p>
<p>The Drake looked doubtfully at Lyonette as she smiled desperately at him.</p>
<p>“But Erin isn’t here right now. She’s the innkeeper.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but <em>I’m</em> still here, aren’t I?”</p>
<p>“I guess you are.”</p>
<p>“Well then. Why not come in? Erin’s inn—is still her inn even without her, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“That might be true?”</p>
<p>Olesm frowned. He looked backwards towards the city as if he was considering leaving, then he reluctantly shrugged.</p>
<p>“I guess I could stay for a bit…”</p>
<p>“Good!”</p>
<p>Lyonette nearly gasped with relief. She opened the door and the Drake stepped in. He shivered; the inside of the inn was scarcely warmer than the outside.</p>
<p>“It’s<em> freezing </em>in here! Why isn’t the fire on?”</p>
<p>“I…forgot.”</p>
<p>Lyonette pretended to fuss with some kindling in the fireplace. Then she struck some sparks with the flint and steel and the fire flickered into life. Olesm watched the small flames consume the shaved wood and begin to eat away at the larger sticks Lyonette had arranged in the fireplace as he stared around the empty building.</p>
<p>“It’s so dark. And gloomy. Uh, not that that’s a bad thing. I guess when Erin’s not here…”</p>
<p>He cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“Did—did you say you had something to eat? I wouldn’t mind a snack.”</p>
<p>“Food? Oh, now that you mention it—”</p>
<p>Lyonette turned as casually as possible and gave Olesm her best contrite expression.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but I forgot—there’s nothing left in the pantry. With Erin gone, there’s no one to go shopping.”</p>
<p>“Not you?”</p>
<p>The Drake frowned at Lyon. She hesitated.</p>
<p>“I can’t go into the city. I’m banned.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah. Right. You’re the thief.”</p>
<p>“I—”</p>
<p>Lyonette hesitated. Then she slowly closed her mouth. She was the thief, even if she didn’t have the [Thief] class. She hadn’t seen herself as one, but the Drakes and Gnolls thought of her that way. She had to humor him.</p>
<p>“I am. That is right.”</p>
<p>She tried to look apologetic as possible.</p>
<p>“It’s all my fault, of course. I would go shopping, but I can’t. So there’s nothing to eat here.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>The Drake just stared at Lyonette. She cleared her throat again.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what I’ll do without food. If I can’t serve people, how will I keep the inn open until Erin gets back?”</p>
<p>“You? You’re going to keep The Wandering Inn open?”</p>
<p>The look Olesm gave Lyon was full of disbelief. She gritted her teeth, but nodded.</p>
<p>“It’s my job. I <em>am </em>a [Barmaid] after all. And I’m Erin Solstice’s employee. She said so herself. And what sort of…help would I be if I didn’t keep her inn open and earn her money while she was gone?”</p>
<p>“I suppose that makes sense.”</p>
<p>Olesm frowned as he scratched at his chin. Lyonette nodded, the desperate smile still fixed on her face.</p>
<p>“So I need someone to help deliver food to the inn while Erin’s gone. I’ll pay of course—and you can eat here as well!”</p>
<p>“Wait, what? You want <em>me</em> to bring you food?”</p>
<p>The Drake sat up in his chair and frowned hard at Lyonette. She nodded, keeping her eyes on him.</p>
<p>“You have to. Not cooked food; I’ll sell food here like Erin did. But you have to bring the supplies here so I can cook it. Or else I’ll starve. And you wouldn’t want that, would you?”</p>
<p>The Drake gave Lyonette a look that wasn’t quite as reassuring as she’d hoped. But he eventually agreed to find a way to get Lyonette more food.</p>
<p>“I guess I can make a few trips—but how will you keep the inn open? Without Erin, doesn’t this place lose a lot of its ah, attraction? Why would anyone come this far?”</p>
<p>“Why, because I’ll cook fine food of course, and serve people with grace and decorum!”</p>
<p>“Really? You?”</p>
<p>Olesm looked completely unconvinced. Lyonette ground her teeth, but she smiled at him.</p>
<p>“I <em>do</em> have a Skill in cooking.”</p>
<p>“You do?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely. And I’ve waited tables for nearly a month. You just bring the ingredients, and I’ll cook it. In fact, why don’t you bring some right now? I have money and a list right here…”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s sort of cold out—you mean now? What about—”</p>
<p>Olesm blinked as Lyonette thrust a sheet of parchment and some coins into his claws and practically pushed him out the door. She stared anxiously at him in the snow as he stared at the inn, and then watched him trudge slowly down towards the city, heart pounding all the while.</p>
<p>She’d done it! But the real test would be if he came back. Lyonette stared out the window at the faint shape of Olesm as he walked into the city, and then she sat at the window as the air in the room slowly warmed, staring fixedly at the gates.</p>
<p>It felt like forever and a half before she saw a burdened figure leave the city and start walking her way. It felt like even longer before the Drake struggled up the hill and exhaustedly dropped the packs full of ingredients on the doorstep as Lyonette flung open the door.</p>
<p>“Thank you so much for bringing everything here!”</p>
<p>“What? It was nothing. I mean, it was a bit heavy—I don’t suppose you have anything to drink?”</p>
<p>“I have to cook first.”</p>
<p>Lyonette was already busy opening the ties on the pack. Olesm nodded as he sagged into a chair.</p>
<p>“In that case, I could definitely use a bite to eat. Something hot.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Now?”</p>
<p>The Human girl stared at the Drake. He stared back.</p>
<p>“Yes. I mean, you <em>are </em>going to make food, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course. But—”</p>
<p>Lyonette hesitated.</p>
<p>“—I have to work on a few recipes first. Why don’t you come back two days from now? Then I’ll probably need some more ingredients. Or—you could return tonight if you want to buy something.”</p>
<p>The Drake looked indignantly at the bulging pack of supplies he’d brought.</p>
<p>“What? My meal’s not on the house?”</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>Lyon glared at him. The Drake glared back.</p>
<p>“Okay, I guess I’ll come back later. I mean, if you’re not busy.”</p>
<p>“You do that. And remember, I’ll need more food soon! And tell your…friends. The Wandering Inn is open again!”</p>
<p>Lyon barely heard the door slam as Olesm walked out. She was too busy staring at the wonderful contents of the pack. Eggs, carefully wrapped to avoid breaking, fresh cheese—flour—her stomach growled uncontrollably and Lyonette’s hands shook.</p>
<p>Half of her wanted to scarf down everything raw, but she made herself drag everything into the kitchen and put all the ingredients away first. She had to do this right.</p>
<p>Almost mechanically, the girl pulled out ingredients and set them on the counter as the fire she’d started in the kitchen began to warm the air here too. She blew on her hands, ignoring her empty stomach as she prepared herself. She was going to cook. She, Lyonette du Marquis, was about to make a meal.</p>
<p>Hot shame and burning desire stole over her in waves, but the emptiness in her stomach quashed all other feelings. Lyonette stared at the ingredients and imagined something basic. Pasta. She remembered the lovely, buttery noodles Erin had served to her and the other guests in the inn one night. She could do that, surely?</p>
<p>Lyon had [Basic Cooking] as a Skill now, a fact that filled her with shame and privately elated her. It was the skill of a peasant, yes, but it was <em>her</em> Skill. It was hers.</p>
<p>That was how she found herself cooking with the flour, salt, eggs, and some water in the kitchen. Lyonette first mixed flour and salt together, and then made a divot in the mound of powder to add a beaten egg. Then she mixed in a beaten egg and squished the sticky mess together until it began to congeal. As if by magic, the disgusting mess of egg and flour became a different substance. Dough!</p>
<p>It was dough, the very thing Lyonette had seen bakers turn into golden loaves of bread! She stared at the small ball sitting on the counter of the kitchen and stared at her flour-covered hands in amazement.</p>
<p>“<em>That’s </em>how it’s done? It’s so…easy!”</p>
<p>She’d expected there to be some laborious process required, or a convoluted mix of ingredients. But this? Barely a few minutes of effort and she was nearly finished with her cooking! Part of Lyon was elated, the rest indignant that people paid [Bakers] and [Cooks] so much. There was nothing to it!</p>
<p>But Lyonette quickly realized she wasn’t done as her Skill prompted her to keep going. She had to knead the dough for several minutes, until Lyonette’s weak hands were cramping up a bit from the effort. Then, she had to find the rolling pin in one of the drawers and smooth out the dough. And then Lyon had to cut the dough into long strips, and then boil water.</p>
<p>That was actually the hardest part. Lyonette had of course gone to fetch water many times in the past for Erin, but she’d hated the duty and had done it as slowly as possible. Since she was making food for herself and she was alone, Lyonette had no excuse. She had to make two trips for water, and she was exhausted by the time she watched the water boil over the fire.</p>
<p>Then, Lyonette added the pasta and a bit of salt and watched the noodles swirl around as she stirred the pot anxiously. After only two minutes the pasta was done. Lyonette dumped the water outside and scooped the rest out of the pot, shaking it to dry the last of the water. Then she put it in one heaping mound on her plate and dug in.</p>
<p>In the lukewarm inn, by the flickering fire, the young [Princess] used a slightly-bent fork to lever the first mount of noodles into her mouth with a shaking hand. She bit, chewed, and swallowed, scarfing down the food almost too quickly to taste it. But she tasted the second bite, and the third, and her face fell with each new forkful of her pasta.</p>
<p>It couldn’t be. But it was. As the aching feeling in her stomach subsided, Lyonette slowly chewed the slightly watery noodles and knew the truth. Her food wasn’t great. It wasn’t even good. It was bland. No, worse, it was simply mediocre. True, she’d made noodles thanks to her skill, but they were a far cry from what Erin could now do.</p>
<p>Lyonette had been famished, but even she couldn’t finish the huge mound on her plate. After about two thirds of it she just sat back and stared at the pale mass of noodles, disgusted and disappointed in equal parts.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the same at all. She could remember the wonderful noodles Erin had made not so long ago—buttery and hot, and delightfully fragrant thanks to some herb. It had been delicious even without the meatballs. Lyonette’s mouth watered just remembering.</p>
<p>But this? This was just pasta, barely serviceable. It was a disgrace to any inn, and worse, it had come from a Skill. Lyonette’s Skill. Was this all she could do, even with [Basic Cooking]?</p>
<p>Lyonette wanted to cry again. This wasn’t <em>fair. </em>Why was her cooking this bad? She’d remembered ordering one of her [Maids] who had [Basic Cooking] to make her a snack, and while it hadn’t been great, it hadn’t been…this. What had she done wrong?</p>
<p>Then she remembered what one of her tutors had said on the rare days she’d been paying attention. Skills could improve one’s ability greatly and even give them the means to do things they would never be able to do normally, like fish, work metal, or even fight. But a Skill improved on what was already there.</p>
<p>If two [Warriors] with the same Skills fought, the one who had trained longer and had more actual combat experience would inevitably prevail. Similarly, even with [Basic Cooking], if Lyonette had never made food, all her cooking would be just that: basic.</p>
<p>For two minutes Lyonette just stared at the cold plate of noodles, and then she heard a knock at the door. Instantly her body went rigid with fear and apprehension, but Goblins wouldn’t knock, would they? This wasn’t a monster, this was a guest. A guest!</p>
<p>She scrambled to her feet and flung the door open. Her mind was racing—was it too cold inside? She should have opened the windows to let everyone know the inn was open tonight! What about cooking? She couldn’t serve food to—what should she say? What was that Erin had always told her to say to new customers? ‘Welcome, please have a seat?’ or was it, ‘let me take your coat’?</p>
<p>The person standing in the doorway as Lyonette yanked the door open had no coat to take. A massive drake—far bigger than Olesm—blinked down at Lyonette as she stared up at him. After a moment, he coughed.</p>
<p>“Hey…you.”</p>
<p>“Um, welc—do you have a seat for your coat?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Lyonette turned red. The Drake scratched awkwardly at the spines on the back of his head and looked past the young woman into the inn. His eyes noted the single plate and dim fire before they returned to her.</p>
<p>“Is Erin back yet?”</p>
<p>Lyonette gulped. She vaguely recognized the Drake; he was Relc, the one Erin had thrown out of the inn earlier. But he was also a guest, wasn’t he? She tried to smile as welcomingly as possible as she opened the door a bit wider.</p>
<p>“Not yet. But would you like to stay and have something to ea—”</p>
<p>“Nope. See ya.”</p>
<p>The Drake turned before Lyonette had even finished her sentence. Desperately, she threw the door open to call out to him, but her breath caught in her chest when she saw the black Antinium standing next to the Drake in the snow. He’d been so still, so silent, she hadn’t even seen him at first.</p>
<p>Klbkch stared at Lyonette for a second and then turned to walk away with the Drake. Lyonette stood in the doorway, staring at the two [Guardsmen]’s backs. They waited until they were a few paces away from the inn to start speaking, but the wind blew their voices up the hill towards her.</p>
<p>“Looks like Erin’s not back yet.”</p>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>
<p>“But who was that Human? I’ve never seen her before, have you?”</p>
<p>“I believe it was the thief that Erin Solstice employed.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“The one who burned down Miss Krshia’s shop, I believe. The one exiled from the city.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“The Human girl.”</p>
<p>“There are a lot of—”</p>
<p>“The one who called you ‘scaley oaf’.”</p>
<p>“Oh! <em>Her.</em> Hey, can I go back inside and beat her up a bit?”</p>
<p>Lyonette shrank back in the doorway, but the other voice stopped the first.</p>
<p>“That would not be wise. If Erin Solstice comes back and finds you have attacked her staff, she will most likely ban you for life.”</p>
<p>“Damn. Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Very. You will have to give her your apology gift later. Although, you will first have to buy her a gift.”</p>
<p>“Hrgh. I know, I know. But what do Human females like, anyways? Should I get her some meat? Jewels? I don’t have that much money on me, you know.”</p>
<p>“I recommend we ask about. There are Humans in the city. Let us ask them.”</p>
<p>“Sure, I guess. If we have to. Hey, where should we eat tonight…?”</p>
<p>The voices trailed off as the wind changed directions. Lyonette shivered as she stood in the open doorway a moment longer, staring out into the dark snow. Then she closed the door. She felt…bad, even though she didn’t know why. But the inn was full of light, especially when she opened the windows and added more fuel to the fire. It was warm and bright and it almost felt like before, even if dinner had been bland. But it wasn’t the same.</p>
<p>It really wasn’t.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone else came by that night. Lyonette was in the kitchen, trying to work out what would make the pasta taste better when she heard the door open. She hurried into the common room and saw a man wearing a worn, serviceable dark cloak shaking snow off of it as he looked around. A dagger at his side was his only weapon, but he walked as if he only needed his piercing glare to kill anything that might accost him.</p>
<p>Lyon recognized him as well. The man looked as annoyed as ever, and perhaps even more so today. His expression was grim, and he reminded Lyon of the oldest and grumpiest of the kingdom’s soldiers. She knew who he was—a Gold-rank adventurer. That made her defer to him slightly, even though she was royalty. It was certainly not because she was afraid of him. Well, maybe a little.</p>
<p>“W-welcome sir! Miss Solstice isn’t back yet, but if you’d like to stay, I could make you some pasta—”</p>
<p>Halrac’s piercing gaze froze Lyon in place. He looked at her, and then around the inn. He shook his head and grunted irritably.</p>
<p>“Hmph.”</p>
<p>He turned and left without another word. Lyonette watched him leave through one of the windows as the adventurer stomped back towards the city through the snow. She didn’t know what to think about that, but she imagined how much money a Gold-rank adventurer might have spent and felt even worse.</p>
<p>All in all, it was almost a relief when Olesm dropped by. The Drake was still irritable, but he came by for dinner by himself. He grew much more cheerful when Lyonette served him pasta and told him he wouldn’t have to pay for it; his expression immediately changed when he bit into the over-salted batch she’d made this time. He ate four bites and then pushed his plate away and didn’t touch it for the remainder of the time he spent in the inn.</p>
<p>Not that he took that long anyways. Olesm only stayed long enough to tell Lyonette about the Goblin army’s sacking of Esthelm, the news that Erin was alive in Celum, and that she wasn’t coming back any time soon. She badgered him with questions, but the Drake had no answers.</p>
<p>“I don’t know when she can come back, okay?”</p>
<p>He snapped at her as he drank some of the hot water she’d boiled and grimaced at the taste. It was the same water she’d used for the noodles, and he pushed that back on the table as well after another sip.</p>
<p>“But—when will she return? Can she?”</p>
<p>Lyonette wrung her hands. Olesm just shrugged, looking unhappy.</p>
<p>“It’s dangerous on the roads, and frankly, it might be safer where she is. After everyone’s [Dangersense] got triggered in the city, Zevara’s put the entrance to the dungeon on permanent watch with every spare [Guardsman] she can muster.”</p>
<p>“The dungeon?”</p>
<p>Lyonette had no [Dangersense]; she hadn’t even realized the entrance to the dungeon had been uncovered. Olesm nodded as he exclaimed.</p>
<p>“None of the adventurers want to go in. Griffon Hunt hasn’t even gone through the entrance yet, and all the other groups are staying put. No one’s sure what will come out—if anything. Someone’s got to go in, but until one of the groups works up the nerve, it’s another threat along with those Goblins that the city has to be wary of.”</p>
<p>He sighed and stood up. Lyonette watched him anxiously. Olesm looked at the food and water and shook his head briefly before digging in his pocket.</p>
<p>“Here.”</p>
<p>He put a few bronze coins on the table and nodded to them.</p>
<p>“For the food. I’m not that hungry, I guess.”</p>
<p>“You’re going? Already?”</p>
<p>Lyonette was surprised at the tone of her own voice. Normally she would have welcomed silence, but Olesm was the first person to even enter the inn since Erin had left. The Drake nodded, looking tired.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to plan some stuff out with Zevara and—well, I’m busy. I’ll stop by tomorrow, though.”</p>
<p>“But why not stay here? For a little while longer, I mean?”</p>
<p>Olesm paused, looking awkward.</p>
<p>“I’ve really got to be going. I still need to ea—I mean, I’ve got a lot…”</p>
<p>He stopped and stared at something in the corner of the room. Lyonette’s eyes were drawn to the ghostly chessboard on one of the tables. None of the pieces had moved since Erin had left, but the Drake’s eyes fixed on them for a few seconds. He looked back at Lyonette.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t happen to play chess, would you?”</p>
<p>Lyon shook her head reluctantly. She remembered it being the latest trend in court, but she’d never picked up the game. Olesm looked disappointed.</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>He left soon after, despite Lyonette’s attempts to entice him to stay. Afterwards, Lyonette stared at the bad pasta and hurled it into the fire along with the plate. It made a horrible mess and stunk terribly as the fire consumed the pasta. Then Lyon just stood in the center of the room as the smell of burnt food filled the inn.</p>
<p>She was lost. For a few minutes Lyonette desperately tried to suppress her tears, but then they came forth and she just stood in the empty inn, letting them roll down her cheeks and drip onto the floor.</p>
<p>It was all over. She couldn’t do it. She couldn’t cook, and no one liked her. Lyonette had known that—she’d even relished the knowledge before. But now, she knew it would be her death. No one would buy any food. She’d starve to death and Erin would find her bones in the inn when she came back.</p>
<p>She was a failure. That’s all she was and would ever be. The pitiful third daughter of a small kingdom, dying alone in an inn that wasn’t hers. She was nothing.</p>
<p>The girl curled up on the floor as the embers of the fire glowed and faded. She stopped crying because even that was no use, and lay there, waiting to die. She grew still as she rolled herself up into a ball of misery. Then the door opened, and the Antinium walked in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pawn didn’t know why he went to The Wandering Inn. It was just where his feet carried him. The Antinium had no idea what to do or where do go; he just knew that he might find the answers he sought if he could listen to a certain young woman for a while.</p>
<p>It had been a long time since he’d gone there. In fact, this morning he’d intended nothing of the kind. Pawn had woken up sitting in his small sleeping spot and believed today would be like all the rest. Empty and uncertain.</p>
<p>The Antinium do not lie down to sleep. It’s not that they can’t, but their backs do not curve like mammals. Pawn’s own back resembled a beetle’s in many ways, and he disliked the rocking that occurred when he tried to lie down. Thus, both Workers and Soldiers alike slept while sitting. It was the most economic use of space, and in the huge barrack-like sleeping area that held five hundred Workers, Pawn had had an adequate six hours of rest.</p>
<p>That was how Pawn’s day began. He would pull himself out of his small cubicle of dirt with his four arms and file into line with the other Workers as they left the room at the same time to receive their morning nutrition.</p>
<p>It was easier for Pawn to do this today than it had a few weeks ago. He had regrown all but a few digits on his hands, and his severed limbs had nearly fully regenerated thanks to the unique healing substances the Antinium used. As he stood behind a Worker, Pawn flexed his digits and marveled a bit at how the simplicity of that action alone made him feel so much better.</p>
<p>The Workers ahead and behind Pawn did not look at their hands, or even move except when they walked forwards. They were not like Pawn. They kept their gazes straight and did not talk. And they gave Pawn more room than strictly necessary.</p>
<p>He was the odd one out. Pawn knew that, but he tried not to take advantage of his position. When he stood in line the Worker gave him the same amount of brown-grey paste as the other Workers. Perhaps if he’d asked for more, he would have received it, but the calculated ration was enough to sustain him throughout the day. Besides, no one would ever <em>ask </em>for more of the Worker’s food than normal.</p>
<p>Pawn stood in the food consumption area and slowly ingested the muck he had been given. There were no seats for the Antinium to eat at; they simply collected their rations on earthenware bowls and ate as efficiently as possible before depositing the bowls to be used again by more Workers filing into the room.</p>
<p>Workers and Soldiers ate separately. This wasn’t because one group ate better quality food than the other—they all ate the same highly-caloric mush, but Soldiers just ate three times as much as Workers, and thus used different containers, necessitating a separate room to feed in. Pawn stared at the brown clump of mushed up…something…as he put it between his mandibles and chewed. The food went down easily, but the taste—</p>
<p>He had grown used to it. Even so, it was never what one would call easy. The Workers ate the food quickly, showing no signs of disgust, even though Pawn knew they had to be tasting exactly what he did. If they had gag reflexes—or an alternative food source, it might have been a different matter.</p>
<p>But food was food, and there were no alternatives. Except at Erin’s inn. Pawn could remember having delicious meals there, and he had to force himself to eat the rest of the mush. He <em>crunched </em>down on something on his last bite. Something hadn’t been fully processed? He swallowed it anyways. It was a nice interlude from the rest of the mush. Perhaps it had been a bone fragment.</p>
<p>Then, as soon as they had finished eating, the Workers moved as one out of the large cavern used for food preparation and into the tunnels to begin their daily duties. Pawn followed them, not pausing to duck even though the ceiling of the tunnel was barely a foot over his head.</p>
<p>That was another feature of the Antinium Hive in Liscor. While some of the cavernous rooms were indeed quite large, designed to hold large numbers of the Antinium, many parts of the Hive had been optimized for space. Thus, the tunnels used solely by Workers were barely large enough to accommodate them. They had only a foot of height as they marched through the cramped corridors built to accommodate exactly two Workers at a time. And such was the flow of Workers going to their daily duties—</p>
<p>Well, any creature with a hint of claustrophobia would have suffered greatly. Pawn didn’t mind; it was what he was used to. He walked with hundreds of other Workers as they walked through the tunnels and around each other in a perfect, synchronized flow of traffic that never halted or wasted time. Hundreds of Workers moved in every direction, going aboveground to work for the city, or below to dig or shore up collapsed tunnel walls, fulfill other tasks around the Hive, and so on.</p>
<p>This was only one of the shifts of Workers that worked throughout the day. Pawn was one of the Workers who slept from just before midnight to around dawn, so he considered himself close to a ‘normal’ sleeping habit. But there were other Workers who would sleep in the middle of the day. It didn’t matter; all time was the same in the Hive.</p>
<p>Pawn walked down the narrow Worker corridors until he came to a main intersection in the Hive. Here, traffic diverged and more bodies entered the ceaseless cascade of motion. Larger Soldiers marched in huge columns down the massive highway of bodies, going to reinforce weak spots in the Hive, to eat, or just to rest until they were called on again. Here the Workers joined other flows, moving deeper into the Hive, or up above.</p>
<p>Pawn walked forwards, following the Worker ahead of him until he came to the split in the traffic. There he paused, uncertain. The Worker behind him paused, and so did the Worker behind him, and behind him and so on. In an instant, thousands of bodies stopped for one crucial second until the Worker behind Pawn awkwardly walked around him. The Worker behind him followed the motion and so did the Worker behind him and behind him…</p>
<p>Instantly, the flow of traffic resumed. Unlike traffic in Erin’s world, the Workers did not hesitate. They moved in perfect synchronization, so that after the initial pause, traffic flow resumed without any pileups as it were. Even so, the incident had cost all the Workers following Pawn a precious second of inactivity. Pawn knew he should feel guilty, but he didn’t.</p>
<p>He stared at the bodies walking around him. Here were Workers, going to their duties. Across from him, another stream of Soldiers was rapidly advancing down the hallway, nearly running. They might be off to fight monsters.</p>
<p>Part of Pawn wondered what would happen if he walked in front of them. Would the Soldiers just trample him? They did that to other Workers who accidentally got in their way. But would his status as an Individual mean they’d avoid him?</p>
<p>He decided not to test this theory. Instead, Pawn resumed walking, resulting in a micro-second of delay as he rejoined the flow of Workers. He walked upwards, up towards a special room built near the surface of the Hive.</p>
<p>A large room had been sectioned off and given a new purpose. Instead of acting as another feeding room, the low-ceilinged area had been filled with cushions, small rectangular wooden boards filled with pieces, and even the odd chair. Antinium, all Workers, sat around these boards, playing chess.</p>
<p>They all paused when Pawn entered the room. The Workers looked up at Pawn, and then resumed playing. He stared around the room, looking at all the seated Antinium playing chess.</p>
<p>In truth, the dirt ceiling was too low to really allow any Workers to sit on the chairs. They sat around the chess boards on the dirt instead, completely ignoring the cushions that had been piled neatly in one corner of the room and never been used.</p>
<p>There were around sixty Workers in the room at the moment, all engaged in a board game. None of them looked up from their games, and they moved at very regular intervals. The rhythmic <em>click</em> of wooden pieces gently tapping on the board soothed Pawn. But he did not sit down at an empty board as he usually did. If he had, he would have had an opponent in seconds. But Pawn didn’t want that today.</p>
<p>Instead, he sat with his back to one of the dirt walls. Pawn stared ahead, not really at the chess players. They were all new Individuals, the few that had survived and not become Aberrations like the rest. They had chosen names, and they were all learning to play chess, as per the recommendations Pawn had made to Klbkch.</p>
<p>But they were not…like him. Pawn knew that. These new Individuals were not like he was. Nor were they like the original Individuals, the original Workers that had chosen names.</p>
<p>“Hah.”</p>
<p>Pawn chuckled out loud at the ridiculousness of <em>that </em>thought. Instantly, every Worker in the room paused in their chess playing and looked up at him as one. He froze in place, unsure of what to do. After a second the Workers returned to playing as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>That was it. Pawn closed his mandibles and made sure not to make another sound as the sounds of chess resumed. These new Individuals had names, but they didn’t have what he and the others had. They still obeyed orders like any other Worker, and they didn’t express their opinions. They hadn’t developed personality like he, Bird, Belgrade, Anand, and Garry, the only surviving original Individuals had. It wasn’t these new Individuals’ fault, of course. They had been forced into the choice, they hadn’t made it themselves. They didn’t have…Erin.</p>
<p>Things had been simpler a few months ago. Back then, the Hive had made sense to Pawn. There were Workers and Soldiers, the Prognugator, and the Queen. That was how it had been. But now there were Workers and Soldiers yes, and the Queen, but they had a Revalantor who also acted as a Prognugator in the form of Klbkch. He had kicked the former Prognugator who was also the new Prognugator, Ksmvr, <em>out of</em> the Hive. And there was a new group of Antinium.</p>
<p>The Individuals. Over a hundred Workers who had chosen names and been tested for individuality without becoming Aberration. But in that group of Individuals, there were five…leaders.</p>
<p>No, not leaders. Five exceptions. Five of the <em>original</em> Individuals who had become so of their own volition, to save a Human named Erin Solstice. They had been the chess club, her chess club, the Workers who had played at her inn every few days. And they had given their lives, almost all of them, to protect her from the undead.</p>
<p>That was the real change in the Hive. Five Antinium had chosen and become Individual, taking classes and names and true personalities. They had begun to level up rapidly like any other species, and they had become…</p>
<p>Unique. And it had to be said, of the five, one in particular stood out.</p>
<p>Pawn.</p>
<p>He was the first. Pawn knew that. He had been the first to choose a name, the first to choose. Because of that everyone treated him as if he were special. Klbkch, the Queen—they gave him no duties, no responsibilities. They just watched him to see what he would do. And Pawn had no idea what to do, so most days he just walked up to the chess room and either played games or sat like this.</p>
<p>He didn’t do much. Pawn just sat here, day after day. Thinking, really. That was all he could do. He was no gifted warrior like Bird, and nor was he particularly interested in other classes like Garry, Belgrade and Anand. Already the other four had begun to specialize in their roles just as his Queen had hoped. Bird had begun using a bow to harvest a large number of his namesakes even in the wintery climate, and Garry had learned to fry them and make a palatable snack out of their carcasses.</p>
<p>Belgrade and Anand had continued to improve in their [Tactician] class. They had already fought numerous engagements against the dungeon monsters in the tunnels below. They were all becoming assets to the Hive. But Pawn was different.</p>
<p>All the Workers knew it. Pawn knew it. He was different. He was the Worker that Erin had first spoken to, the first Worker to choose his name. Even the other four treated him differently. Because he was first. He was special. He hadn’t just chosen, he had <em>been chosen</em> by Erin.</p>
<p>He was unique. But Pawn had no idea what that meant.</p>
<p>He knew what his Queen wanted, what Klbkch wanted. They wanted him to become a useful warrior, or an asset to the Hive. They wanted him to specialize, to level up in a class and surpass normal Antinium in that way. But Pawn hadn’t done that.</p>
<p>Yes, he had the [Tactician] class. But he wasn’t that high-level in it. In fact, he’d stagnated his growth weeks ago. Pawn still loved to play chess, and he was the best player among the Workers by far. But like Erin, he had ceased to level.</p>
<p>And he had no interest in using a bow like Bird. He didn’t like to cook, only to eat, and he had no burning desire to do anything else in the Hive. Pawn was sure that if he walked anywhere in the Hive—save perhaps the Queen’s room—he could find something to do.</p>
<p>There was always work to do in the Hive. Since he had been allowed aboveground, Pawn had learned something of the customs of other species. Apparently boredom was something their peoples had to fight against. It was an alien concept in the Hive.</p>
<p>Were you done with your assigned duties? In that case, there was always time to be spent processing the nutritional paste the Antinium ate, chewing food up and regurgitating it into a vat to be mixed up with long poles. Or you could be sent to guard against monsters attacking from the dungeon underneath Liscor, supporting the Soldiers in their tireless battle.</p>
<p>And if neither of those two options were viable, you could be assigned to monitor the larvae, or maybe dig. There was always time to dig. You could dig out a collapsed tunnel, dig a new tunnel, dig a deeper tunnel, widen a tunnel, dig out a room, dig into a promising mine shaft, dig out a hole for excrement…</p>
<p>Occasionally, the Workers would build something. That was a refreshing change of pace. They would make wooden load-bearing supports to hold up the titanic weight of the dirt overhead, or fashion crude arrows out of wood. But even that grew tiring after hours of monotonous work blended together.</p>
<p>It wasn’t for Pawn. He knew that. He knew he wanted something different. And perhaps he had found it. Perhaps.</p>
<p>But he was no longer sure. The certainty, the faith that had filled him weeks ago had long since departed, and now Pawn could only rely on uncertain memory to fill the hole in his heart. Had it really happened? Was it true?</p>
<p>Was he really an [Acolyte]? What did it mean?</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Another pause, and the Workers looked up. This time Pawn stared back, just to see what would happen. They looked down as one, and he went back to thinking.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, an Antinium had been questioned. He had been asked who he was, and he had no answers. He had wondered why his…friends…had all died, whether it was all for nothing. And he had been given an answer. A ray of hope.</p>
<p>“Faith.”</p>
<p>So the girl had told him. She had reached down into his despair and offered him something to hold onto. She had spoken to him of something beyond his understanding. A God. And a place…a place where the dead might go to rest. A wonderful place.</p>
<p>“Heaven.”</p>
<p>Pawn sighed, and clenched his still-healing fist. He stared at it. Yes, that night he had believed. And his belief had become reality! He had gained a Skill, and a class. [Acolyte], and the Skill, [Prayer]. It had meant something to him at the time, he had been sure.</p>
<p>There was a God. There was something to believe in. But in the days since, Pawn’s faith had wavered. He had not leveled again, and neither had he prayed. Because…because he was afraid.</p>
<p>There was a God. Erin had told him that. Not just a God, though. Gods. She had talked about a God who was born and died in her world, but apparently that God wasn’t the only one. Other people believed in a God who was the same, but different, but who had never said certain things.</p>
<p>“Are you even there? Will you answer me? Am I worthy of asking you such things?”</p>
<p>No response. The Workers looked up at Pawn and down at their chessboards. He looked up at the ceiling, in the direction Erin had told him heaven probably lay. He saw only dirt.</p>
<p>Heaven. Faith and Gods were all confusing to Pawn, but the idea of Heaven, the idea of forgiveness and a place to be happy was what he had clung to. He had believed in that, and so been rewarded. But if he was to pray, as his Skill seemed to indicate, then to who? To Erin’s God? Only…he wasn’t her God. That’s what she had said. So then, who did he pray to?</p>
<p>And for what? Why? What would it do? And would anyone answer? Would anyone care, or would his words go unheard?</p>
<p>Pawn didn’t know. He hadn’t known for the last week, and he was no closer sitting in the corner of the chess room. Part of him didn’t want to know. Another part told him to talk to Klbkch and his Queen, tell them of his new class. But the last part wanted to believe. It wanted to know of this God, and to put his self into believing in that God. To reach that place called ‘Heaven’.</p>
<p>But he was afraid. Afraid of knowing the truth. So Pawn sat in the chess room instead, wondering what would happen if he prayed. Would nothing happen? Or would something, someone answer? Which would be worse?</p>
<p>Pawn didn’t want to know. But he wanted to, desperately. He was afraid that if he went back to Erin, she would tell him he was wrong. That his class was a mistake. That God only existed in her world. Or—</p>
<p>Or that there was a God, but not one for him.</p>
<p>That was his greatest fear. There was a God. Probably. The class he’d received seemed to indicate that. And Pawn wanted to believe in a God. But what if God didn’t want him? Pawn was too afraid to ask.</p>
<p>So as the day passed, he sat quietly in the chess room, thinking. His mind spun in the same circles, over and over again. Workers walked into the room, played chess, walked out. They had their duties. But Pawn had nothing. Not a thing. He only had a question, and an answer he was too afraid to face.</p>
<p>And then, just as soon as he’d woken up, it was nightfall. Pawn knew this because of the clock in his head and the Workers on duty, not from any change in the ambient light. He stood up, stretched; the other Workers waited for him to do or say something. But Pawn just walked out of the room.</p>
<p>This time he went up. Up, to the city above. It wasn’t his choice; Pawn just felt his feet carrying him that direction. He went up, out of the tunnel that was one of the entrances to his Hive. He walked out into the streets of Liscor, around Drakes and Gnolls and Humans who gave him a wide berth in any case. He walked out of the gates of Liscor, and through the snow, up towards the small inn whose windows shone with inviting warm light.</p>
<p>He had to know. He had to ask, at least. Pawn had felt the certainty in his body. He had gained a class and Skill and that meant something. There was a God. But would God accept Pawn? He had to know, and so he had to ask Erin. She would know what to do. She always did.</p>
<p>But Erin wasn’t there. Pawn knocked at the door and then opened it, and saw the girl lying on the ground. She looked up at him, and she was not Erin.</p>
<p>“Excuse me? Is Erin Solstice here?”</p>
<p>“Erin?”</p>
<p>The girl had been curled up into a ball. Now she sprang to her feet and wiped at her face. Her cheeks were wet, and her eyes were red.</p>
<p>“What are you—you’re that Antinium, aren’t you? Pawn?”</p>
<p>“That is so. Is Erin here? I would like to speak with her.”</p>
<p>“Erin? You haven’t heard?”</p>
<p>The girl laughed almost hysterically. Pawn would have frowned if he were able.</p>
<p>“Heard what? Has something happened to Erin Solstice?”</p>
<p>“She’s—gone.”</p>
<p>“Gone?”</p>
<p>Pawn listened incredulously as the young woman explained what had happened. Erin had vanished? How could this have happened? How could anyone have <em>allowed</em> this?</p>
<p>Part of him longed to run out the door, to gather Bird and Garry and the others and immediately search for Erin. But she was safe? In another city?</p>
<p>“She’s safe. But she’s not coming back yet. I don’t think she can with all the Goblins around.”</p>
<p>The Antinium’s mind raced as he considered the implications. Goblin armies. Of course Erin’s safety came first, but if she couldn’t come back—should someone send an escort? Did Klbkch know? He must, but would he send the Soldiers out to guard her? What if—</p>
<p>“So…are you here for something?”</p>
<p>Pawn looked back at the young woman in surprise. Yes, she had stayed here, hadn’t she? Who was she? Someone new?</p>
<p>Lyonette. That was her name. He vaguely remembered Erin hiring her, but hadn’t she been a bad employee? Now the young woman was alone. She wiped at her nose as she pointed at the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Do you want…something to eat?”</p>
<p>Pawn’s first instinct was to refuse, but that would have meant he had to leave the inn. And he wasn’t ready to go back down into the Hive. Not yet. So he nodded, and told Lyonette he could not digest gluten. That threw her for a loop, but she eventually offered him eggs and bacon.</p>
<p>Pawn was under the impression such food was reserved for breakfasts, at least according to Erin, but he accepted. He still had the coins Klbkch had given him to spend. Enough for many meals.</p>
<p>The Worker sat at an empty table as Lyonette rushed into the kitchen and began to bang things about. He stared at the wooden grain, trying to think. Everything was chaos in his mind now.</p>
<p>“Erin is gone.”</p>
<p>There was no one to answer his question. Pawn felt immediately relieved, and then horrible at once. He was no closer to his answer, and the question was tearing him apart. If Erin could not answer him, then—</p>
<p>“Here’s your food!”</p>
<p>A plate was shoved in front of Pawn’s face. He stared at it, and the hand holding it. Lyonette looked anxiously at Pawn as she put it on the table in front of him.</p>
<p>“Sorry. It’s a bit—”</p>
<p>The bacon was slightly burnt. The eggs hadn’t been fully cooked and they ran a bit. Pawn poked at the food with a fork once Lyonette remembered to give him one. He cautiously took a bite of the greasy bacon and chewed.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like the paste the Workers ate at all. It had been so long that Pawn had nearly forgotten the taste of hot food. And <em>salt! </em>Pawn finished the plate and a second helping when Lyonette offered.</p>
<p>Then he sat in the inn, watching the fire fade. It was funny. He had come here searching for answers, and found none. But even without them, he had found an answer of sorts.</p>
<p>Erin was gone. She might be in trouble, but there was no way Pawn could help her. Not as he was. He was useless, a Worker alone. But if there was a God—</p>
<p>There was no Erin. So there was only one person he could ask. One person who might know what this all meant. Klbkch. He had been assigned to watch over Pawn, and it was Pawn’s duty to inform him of any new classes he obtained. He had not done so before, because he was unsure. But now? Now was the time.</p>
<p>He would tell Revalantor Klbkch about his class and ask him what it meant. Perhaps Klbkch would know of Gods. Pawn dug at the belt on his waist and left what he thought was close to an appropriate amount. Usually Erin told him the meal was on the house.</p>
<p>Slowly, Pawn walked out of the door and into the snow. He was no less lost than before, but at least there was something warm inside him. He stared up at the clouded sky. He couldn’t sense heaven up there. Nor could he tell if there was a God.</p>
<p>But maybe there was one. And if there was, Pawn would find him. Slowly, he began to walk through the snow, back into the city, to his Hive.</p>
<p>Gods. Heaven. He tried to believe. This time, Pawn thought he might have succeeded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lyonette watched Pawn go, silent, walking into the snow as he stared upwards. The Antinium had said barely a few words to her all night. He had sat, staring at the fire. But he had also eaten two of her plates and left—</p>
<p>She stared down at the pile of coins on the table. Silver and bronze coins glinted in the moonlight. Trembling, Lyonette scooped up the pile of coins. She counted them. Once, twice, again.</p>
<p>It was enough. More than enough. With this, she could feed herself for several more days. And if he came back—</p>
<p>Lyonette’s heart skipped. Part of her wanted to shout in revulsion at even touching something the Antinium had touched. She still remembered stories about what they had done, what horrible atrocities they had committed. But this one—Pawn—he had paid her.</p>
<p>Maybe it was just one time. But Lyon remembered the Antinium coming into Erin’s inn like clockwork. And they weren’t picky; they’d even loved the bees, disgusting as they’d been. They were a stable, profitable source of income. If she could stomach serving them, maybe, just maybe, she’d survive.</p>
<p>The [Princess] stared out the window at the Antinium’s lonely form as he walked back to the city. She could do it. She could live until Erin got back. She <em>would</em> do it, and she would show Erin she was capable. She would run this inn, and it would be her castle, her sanctuary until Erin came back.</p>
<p>All would be well. Lyonette had to believe in that.</p>

		<p>She owned a hamster, once. That was the reason she’d wanted to be a doctor. She found other reasons later, but the day she decided to learn to heal people was when she sat in the garden outside her house and tried to hold her dying friend together.</p>
<p>Normally, she would want to be a vet, but her parents had talked her out of that. And her aunt had died when she was twelve. She’d stared down at the closed casket and dreamed of being able to save even people who had to be buried in pieces.</p>
<p>And in her last years of high school she’d had the right grades. And she liked biology, she didn’t throw up into her frog like the boy next to her in class, and she didn’t have anything else she wanted to do.</p>
<p>So she’d taken pre-med classes when she wasn’t partying with friends and learning how to live alone. And she’d graduated on time and gone into Medical School, and found that it was hard to manage rent and a part-time job, but not too hard to learn. And then, one day, she’d had to go to the bathroom during a lecture and she’d never come back.</p>
<p>Geneva Scala had found herself in another world. And there she’d learned one thing: she didn’t want to be a doctor. Not anymore. She was a [Doctor] now, but all she did was watch people die.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The person lying on the crude operating table Geneva had set up was screaming in agony. The blade had cut deep into his side, and he was bleeding to death before her eyes. If she didn’t close up his injuries soon, he would be dead.</p>
<p>With one hand, Geneva held a crude wooden device that looked like pliers. She used that to close the artery she’d found and prayed that she could move fast enough.</p>
<p>“<em>Suture!</em>”</p>
<p>She screamed it at the soldier watching with wide eyes. He stared at her. She pointed to the needle and thread.</p>
<p>“I need to close the wound!”</p>
<p>She let another man take over applying pressure on the artery as she held out her hand for the needle. The soldier fumbled with the needle and nearly dropped it onto the dirt floor. Geneva snatched it out of his hands and looked at the thread.</p>
<p>It was just cotton; not even good quality. She’d boiled it, but now she wondered if it would even hold under the pressures she was about subject it to. But then the man screamed and she was out of time.</p>
<p>“Hold him still.”</p>
<p>The two other men did as she ordered, holding the screaming man down as Geneva desperately started to stitch. It was horrific; the needle she’d bought wasn’t sharp enough and she had to poke massive holes in his flesh to try and close the gaping wound in his side. And the blood—</p>
<p>“Keep that artery closed!”</p>
<p>She snapped that at one her assistants. He tried to do as she instructed, but the forceps he was using were made of wood, and they were crude; carved in a single day, more like chopsticks than a true clamp. They slipped, and blood squirted into the man’s stomach.</p>
<p>“Reapply pressure!”</p>
<p>Geneva had to shout it over the man’s screams. He was gagging with pain, still half-awake. But she had no anesthetics, nothing to give him. And now the other man was trying to grasp the artery and failing to find it in the heaving wound. Geneva reached for the forceps and hesitated. The man had gone still.</p>
<p>Slowly, she stared at the flow of blood. It had slowed. She looked at the soldier’s wide, open eyes, and then around the tent at her assistants. They stared at her. Geneva took a breath, and then spoke.</p>
<p>“He’s dead.”</p>
<p>Part of her wanted to add the time of death, but that was pointless. There was no one to record it, and besides, there was no point. Even as she dropped the forceps and needle into the bowl of boiled water and watched the liquid turn red, she knew she had no time to even mourn.</p>
<p>“Take him outside. Bury him. I’ll be out in a second.”</p>
<p>The soldiers haltingly moved to obey her orders. Geneva stared at her hands. They were so red. She had no surgical gloves on, and she’d cut herself earlier that morning. She was not sterile.</p>
<p>Slowly, the young woman glanced around. She was standing in a tent; not an airtight one, just canvas walls and a dirt floor. Her ‘operating table’ was a piece of hardwood. Her surgical tools were a sharpened dagger, a curved sewing needle and inferior thread, and some wooden instruments that were already covered in blood. The men and one woman who assisted her weren’t trained; they weren’t even clean. They were covered in blood and grime.</p>
<p>And she had let another man die in front of her. Geneva still heard his screams. She’d already forgotten his face, but she remembered him begging her as they’d carried him in. He’d asked her to save his life.</p>
<p>And she had failed.</p>
<p>He was the fifth person she’d seen die in front of her eyes. But she could hear shouting, and in the distance, screams. She knew that she would see more corpses before the end of the day. Geneva prayed they wouldn’t be because of her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nearly a week ago, Geneva had walked into a city built onto the side of a lake. She’d stared around at the tall buildings, the interconnected bridges that ran overhead, and most especially at the walking lizard-people and the Centaurs that walked around next to Humans. But she hadn’t stared too long. Instead, Geneva had walked further into the city, until she could hear people shouting and the <em>rat-tat-tat</em> of someone banging on a drum.</p>
<p>The enlisters for the local mercenary groups and larger companies were already hard at work despite the heat of the day. Humans wearing light leather armor stood at small booths next to Centaurs who were practically unarmored save for a padded cloth vest or two, and Dullahans, strange, humanoid creatures who wore armor over their entire bodies and raised their heads up as they shouted at potential recruits.</p>
<p>Fighting men and—no, warriors of every species were talking to these recruiters and debating which group to join amongst themselves. Geneva stared at a Minotaur holding a huge spike club and shuddered as she imagined what would happen if it hit her. She prayed she wasn’t making a mistake. But she had no choice. Her stomach was empty, and even the smell of sweat and various body odors was making her hungry.</p>
<p>“You there! Join the Raverian Fighters!”</p>
<p>A tall man wearing plate armor called out to Geneva across the square. She walked over to him, noting how sweat stood out on his brow. He must have been cooking in the heat, but he made an impression among the more lightly-armed warriors.</p>
<p>“My name is Thriss. I am a [Sergeant] enlisted in the 4<sup>th</sup> Battalion of the Raverian Fighter’s Company. If you’ve got the grit to fight with me, we’ll offer you eight silver coins for each day you see combat, and one for each day you don’t. Stick with us and you’ll have a hot meal each night, trustworthy comrades at your back, and all the loot you can walk off with!”</p>
<p>Geneva had heard every recruiter giving the same speech, but she listened intently even so. Thriss looked her up and down as he shouted to her and the crowd in general. He had an amazingly loud voice—perhaps it was a Skill?</p>
<p>“We specialize in close-combat fighting, but we’ll hire anyone with a decent class.”</p>
<p>He eyed her skeptically.</p>
<p>“You don’t look like a [Warrior]. Are you a [Mage] of some kind? I’d have to ask for a list of your available spells. And we’ll provide you with armor and a weapon, unless that inhibits your spellcasting.”</p>
<p>She had to shake her head because the hubbub was so overwhelming. Geneva stepped forwards and shouted to Thriss as he stepped off the stool he stood on to hear her.</p>
<p>“I’m a Doctor! I treat the wounded! Would you hire me?”</p>
<p>“A [Doctor]?”</p>
<p>He’d spoken the words like they were special. Geneva knew he thought she had a class, although she didn’t actually have one. But he looked her up and down and shrugged.</p>
<p>“Anyone can pull out an arrow or pour a healing potion over a wound, but sometimes a healing potion isn’t good enough. Someone who can save a few wounded—or cut the limb off without too much blood—would be useful. If you’ve got a mark, put it on this paper.”</p>
<p>She was surprised. Geneva had thought she’d have to talk to countless recruiters and make her case before they hired her.</p>
<p>“Just like that?”</p>
<p>Thriss shrugged his broad shoulders at her.</p>
<p>“It’s an odd sort that would lie about having a [Doctor] class. We’ve got no magical items that can see your class and no one who has the [Appraise] Skill, but you didn’t claim a level. And that sort of thing gets found out right quick. If you can carry your own weight and aren’t a troublemaker we’ll make use of you even if you have to clean dishes most of the time. If you can’t fight, well, you’ll learn quick.”</p>
<p>He eyed her intently.</p>
<p>“But I’ve heard of the [Doctor] class, even if I haven’t seen one. Like a [Healer], aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Something like that.”</p>
<p>Geneva lied. She’d never met a [Healer] in this world, but she hoped it was close to what she did. Thriss stared at her, and then nodded.</p>
<p>“If you’re lying to me, we’ll use you as an arrow shield. But if you’re not, we’ll put you to good work. Maybe you’ll even earn a few levels. Speak with the Lizardfolk behind me for instructions. Welcome to the Fighters.”</p>
<p>After that, Thriss had shown her where to sign and Geneva had been given a place to sleep in the campgrounds, a hot meal of grit-like food and boiled corn mixed with meat, and even a sword and dagger. Geneva had slept, uneasily wondering about her fate, until she’d woken in the middle of the night with a realization.</p>
<p>Thriss didn’t want a [Doctor]. Or rather, he was taking a risk on her. But what he really wanted were bodies. The Raverian Fighters were going to battle, and aside from the money spent on feeding her and equipping her, she was just another sword to hurl against the enemy.</p>
<p>Her heart pounded wildly, but then Geneva had gone back to sleep. She was so tired that she only woke one time more, to slap at the mosquitos trying to feast on her. Then she’d gone to sleep. She was so tired she’d completely forgotten to ask Thriss about surgical equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day, Geneva awoke to the sound of Thriss bellowing. It had roused her in a panic, and as she tumbled out of the rough blankets she saw soldiers all around her getting up as well.</p>
<p>Thriss the [Sergeant] had marched out with regular soldiers and officers and roused the hodgepodge collection of warriors he’d recruited yesterday. Geneva had stood awkwardly next to a Dullahan who held her head in her hands as they stared at Thriss. The man wasn’t one for speeches. He’d welcomed them briefly, and then told them they were going to practice fighting.</p>
<p>“My job is normally to whip you lot into shape before we have you fight with the rest of our forces. Trouble is, we’re already engaged to the southeast of here, so I’ve got a day to see what you’re made of before we go marching.”</p>
<p>So they were really mercenaries. Geneva had enlisted because she’d been desperate for food, but the reality only hit her now when Thriss told them they were heading into a battle a few days from now.</p>
<p>“We’re up against several groups this time. A local Centaur clan has allied with the Magehammer Company. They’ve sent two battalions and hired a few mercenary groups. We’re fighting them, supporting the Burning March Company. Don’t worry about the details; just know that we’re expecting you to fight your best. We’ll be fighting in the jungle; if any of you have terrain-based skills or knowledge of the local geography, tell me or one of the officers.”</p>
<p>Geneva heard a few groans, but the rest of the recruits seemed to accept this information as normal. Some of the people who’d signed up looked young—regardless of race, Geneva could recognize teenagers when she saw them. But others looked like veterans, such as the Minotaur with the spiked club who stood head and shoulders above everyone except the few Centaurs who’d enlisted.</p>
<p>“You lot, with me! We’re going to see what you’re made of, and if you don’t know how to fight, by the end of the day you’ll get your [Warrior] class, mark me!”</p>
<p>A tall Dullahan with a scar over her eye bellowed it at the recruits as she took a group of them away. Geneva hesitated. She wasn’t a soldier and she couldn’t—wouldn’t—fight. What should she do?</p>
<p>She found Thriss as the other officers began having the other warriors engage in practice fights. The [Sergeant] opened his mouth to bellow at her, until he remembered.</p>
<p>“You’re the [Doctor], aren’t you? What do you want?”</p>
<p>“I, um, need some supplies if I’m going to be performing surgery.”</p>
<p>Geneva explained her problem hesitantly. She know how these kinds of armies worked; you received pay <em>after</em> a month or two, and it would usually be late to prevent desertions. But she needed gear.</p>
<p>Thriss heard her out, and she was relieved he didn’t shout at her or order her to keep fighting.</p>
<p>“You need tools, eh? How do I know you won’t run off with the money?”</p>
<p>“I told you, I’m a [Doctor]. I need tools to stitch flesh together, and I don’t have any. Don’t tell me you’ve never seen a doctor working?”</p>
<p>Geneva said the words with as much certainty as she could. Thriss shrugged.</p>
<p>“It’s rare enough. Most folks use healing potions, but I have seen healers stitch a wound closed. Why don’t you have what you need already, though?”</p>
<p>“I lost everything I had.”</p>
<p>That at least, was true. She’d lost everything when she’d walked down the hallway of her school and then turned and found green foliage all around her and dirt underneath her shoes instead of sterile tiles.</p>
<p>Thriss eyed her skeptically.</p>
<p>“Hm. Prove it.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>He waved at the groups of soldiers being watched by officers.</p>
<p>“We always get a few injuries, even with blunt weapons. Let’s see if you can help with one of their injuries.”</p>
<p>Geneva’s stomach clenched up, but she nodded. But in her mind she was desperately going over her class notes and the hands-on lessons she’d had in medical school. She hadn’t graduated—she was only in her third year—! But it was too late to back out now.</p>
<p>Soon enough, Geneva had her chance. A young man—a redheaded teen with more confidence than actual ability—failed to raise the shield he’d been given in time. The other man fighting with him struck his shoulder and Geneva saw the young man fall to the ground and scream as his shoulder popped out of its socket.</p>
<p>“No one move! Back to your places!”</p>
<p>Thriss pushed through the circle of people and beckoned Geneva over. He stared at the writhing young man on the ground and looked at her.</p>
<p>“Practice blade must have broken something. Can you set the bone?”</p>
<p>Geneva shook her head automatically as she stared at the young man. He was trying to touch and not touch his injured arm at the same time.</p>
<p>“The bone isn’t broken. His shoulder is dislocated; he needs to have it set.”</p>
<p>Thriss’ eyes glinted and Geneva saw his lips twitch for a second. It had been a test, she was sure.</p>
<p>“Can you fix it?”</p>
<p>“I can if he doesn’t move.”</p>
<p>“You heard her! Hold still, lad! It’s just a dislocation; nothing to bawl about!”</p>
<p>Thriss slapped the young man and held him still as Geneva gingerly grabbed the arm. The young man’s skin was slippery with sweat and he was shaking, but she knew what to do. He screamed and whimpered, but Geneva had learned how to fix a dislocated shoulder. After one try she popped the arm back in place and the man stopped moaning and stared at his arm in disbelief.</p>
<p>“He’ll need a few weeks to recover.”</p>
<p>“No time for that. Here. Use this.”</p>
<p>Thriss pulled out a glass bottle filled with green sloshing liquid out of his belt. Geneva eyed it skeptically.</p>
<p>“It’s a weak potion, but it should do. Go on. Unless you’ve got a Skill or spell that will do better?”</p>
<p>Geneva didn’t, but she’d never seen a healing potion work before. She couldn’t let anyone know that, though, so she pulled out the cork. The smell the green liquid gave off was incredibly bad, but the young man was looking at it hopefully.</p>
<p>Gingerly, Geneva poured some of the green liquid on the shoulder, and watched in disbelief as the already swollen flesh receded and the man gasped in relief. The area still looked raw, though, so Geneva added a bit more of the potion until it looked completely normal.</p>
<p>“Good!”</p>
<p>Thriss accepted the two-thirds full potion from Geneva and stood up. He offered the young man a hand, and the youth took it as he stood, flexing his good arm and laughing as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t waste a potion on you, but we’ve got a battle to get to, and you’re no use to us with one arm!”</p>
<p>Thriss’s voice echoed around the campsite and the other soldiers stopped practicing to listen.</p>
<p>“Mark my works, stick with us and you won’t be looking for potions when you’ve got an arrow in your stomach! We’ve got healing supplies that will take care of anything save having your head chopped off—unless you’re a Dullahan—and we’ve even got a [Doctor] in case the healing potions don’t work!”</p>
<p>He pointed to Geneva, and she felt eyes on her. Geneva blushed a bit, but she didn’t shy away from the attention. The rational, calm part of her was thinking, though. Thriss had had the healing potion ready, and he’d been expecting someone to get hurt. She looked at the soldier who’d been dueling the young man. He was a veteran, not a new recruit. They’d probably planned all of this out to bolster the recruit’s confidence, and testing Geneva’s involvement had only added to the charade.</p>
<p>Her suspicions were confirmed when Thriss took her back to his tent and he put the healing potion in a chest which he locked with a key. He looked at her as she fished around in the supplies and came up with a bag which he added some coins to.</p>
<p>“That was quick. I’ve seen men tear flesh trying to get the bone into place, but you did that in seconds.”</p>
<p>He thrust the bag at her and Geneva looked inside. A handful of silver pieces glittered at her.</p>
<p>“Take it and buy what you need. I’ll have one of the local boys show you around.”</p>
<p>So she wouldn’t run off with the money. Geneva accepted the small bag gratefully. Then she had to wait for Thriss to find a young Lizardboy to guide her. All the while she was still struggling with the unreality of it all.</p>
<p>Magical potions that could do several weeks’ worth of healing in a few seconds? Soldiers fighting with swords? Lizard people, Centaurs, and a race of people who could take their heads off like hats?</p>
<p>Just what had she gotten herself into?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took Geneva most of the day to gather what she needed, which was to say, a needle fit for doing any kind of surgery. In truth, she would have liked some antibiotics, general and local anesthetics, a supply of needles, disinfectant—</p>
<p>But she knew she was going to get none of that here. So Geneva got what she knew she could get, which was a needle, a curved one, the kind that she could use to sew flesh. Regular, straight needles just wouldn’t do.</p>
<p>Still, even finding that one instrument in the city was a challenge. It wasn’t as if this world—some kind of medieval world filled with magic—had anything like modern equipment. Geneva had to talk to three [Seamstresses] until one old lizard woman had what she was looking for.</p>
<p>“This is a needle I use to sew carpets, not flesh, Human.”</p>
<p>The old Lizardwoman with discolored scales eyed Geneva suspiciously, but sold her three curved needles in the end, along with the thread to match. It was dearly expensive, but Geneva still had enough left for some cloth and scissors. She needed bandages, and scissors were essential.</p>
<p>Thriss had eyed Geneva’s purchases and snorted when she returned. He’d taken the few coppers she had left.</p>
<p>“Bandages? Good if you’ve not a healing potion on hand, I suppose. But if you need cloth, we’ve got enough rags. Ask the quartermaster for the rest of what you need and get ready to march tomorrow. We’ll need to cover at least fifteen miles and you’ll have your own pack to carry.”</p>
<p>After that, Geneva sat with laughing males and females of various races as they ate before they slept. The air was hot and humid, as it had been every day Geneva had been here, and bugs tried to bite or drink from her. But the food on her plate was filling, and she could even smile and accept thanks from the young man whose arm she’d set.</p>
<p>And as the second night had come and the weary new recruits were bedding down, Geneva had curled up into her blankets and covered her head so no one could see her. That was the moment when she allowed herself to shake and choke on her fears.</p>
<p>What was she doing? She didn’t have any real equipment. She needed proper surgical gear, not sewing needles and bits of cloth. She needed forceps, a sterilized operating room, disinfectant, antibiotics, anesthetics—</p>
<p>“But I have no choice.”</p>
<p>Geneva whispered that to herself until the person sleeping next to her grunted in irritation. She shut up. She had no choice. She had to survive.</p>
<p>This was Baleros, and the jungles were filled with monsters and the species were constantly fighting one another. If she didn’t have work, she would starve or be killed. And there wasn’t much use for a [Doctor], not in a land filled with magic healing potions.</p>
<p>Geneva Scala stared at the needle and thread in her pack and the bandages, water bottle, and pot she’d asked the quartermaster for. Her hands trembled as she imagined trying to save anyone’s life with such limited supplies. She stared at the sword and remembered her Hippocratic Oath.</p>
<p>Not the ancient Grecian oath that forbade the use of a knife in medicine, but the one she’d sworn to herself. She’d adopted her namesake, the Declaration of Geneva and made her own oath.</p>
<p>She murmured it now, half in her mind, half out loud.</p>
<p>“<em>I solemnly pledge to consecrate my life to the service of humanity. I will practice my profession with conscience and dignity; the health of my patient will be my first consideration; I will respect the secrets that are confided in me. I will not use my medical knowledge to violate human rights and civil liberties, even under threat…</em>”</p>
<p>She fell asleep before she could finish the rest. But the words echoed in her dreams. Only, now the word humanity was wrong. She had to protect people. But she was a soldier, too. She might have to fight.</p>
<p>She couldn’t do that. She had sworn a higher oath. Even if she was in another world, another place where magic existed and people leveled up like a video game, she had her oath.</p>
<p>It was the only thing she had left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Doctor Class Obtained!]</p>
<p>[Doctor Level 1!]</p>
<p>[Skill – Lesser Resistance: Disease obtained!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“So you’re a [Doctor]?”</p>
<p>That was the question Geneva received at least ten times the next day, as she found herself marching across a dirt road and into increasingly thick underbrush. The 4<sup>th</sup> Battalion of Raverian Fighters set out to join the fighting.</p>
<p>In truth, Geneva had no idea where they were on this continent, or where they were going. She wasn’t even sure what they were fighting <em>for</em>, which amazed the soldiers who decided to speak with her on the march.</p>
<p>She was in 6<sup>th</sup> Squad, under Thriss himself. Their group—and indeed, most of the battalion—was Human. Oh, a few Centaurs, Dullahan, Lizardfolk, and even the Minotaur marched with them, but Geneva understood that species generally stuck together, even in mercenary groups.</p>
<p>“It’s easiest to coordinate attacks if everyone’s the same species for the most part. ‘Sides, we Humans have to stick together, right?”</p>
<p>So proclaimed the red-haired young man who’d been the first to join Geneva on the march. He shouldered the pack he’d been given with only a little difficulty and kept stroking the hilt of his sword with clear excitement. Geneva heard a snort and saw the three men and two women walking with them laughing at him.</p>
<p>“Ignore Lim. He don’t know what he’s talking about. We’d be far better if we had a few more Dullahan in our company. They’ve got armor for skin; all Lim’s got is a big mouth and a bad shoulder.”</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>Lim looked hurt as Geneva laughed. The woman who’d spoken—Clara—had dark skin, reminiscent of a Native American’s, which made Geneva more and more convinced that she was in some twisted version of the Americas. Somewhere around Brazil or maybe the Amazons—the plant life and constant, intrusive humidity and heat seemed to suggest it.</p>
<p>“I’m surprised you wanted to join up with the Fighters, though, Geneva. Don’t [Healers] generally stay away from the fighting?”</p>
<p>“I guess. But I don’t have any money, and this was my only option.”</p>
<p>Clara nodded sympathetically.</p>
<p>“Still, if you won’t be fighting you’ve got a better chance than Lim. What’s a [Doctor] do, anyways? Don’t healing potions make your class obsolete?”</p>
<p>“Maybe.”</p>
<p>That’s what Geneva had been worrying about. She shook her head.</p>
<p>“Healing potions don’t work on everything, though, right?”</p>
<p>“True.”</p>
<p>A man with a thick beard and bald head nodded sagely. He had several scars that made Geneva wonder whether they’d been healed naturally or whether the healing potion hadn’t quite worked.</p>
<p>“A good healing potion’ll put together some broken bones and mend skin and even your guts, but a bad one only does a bit of healing. ‘Sides, do you think we’ve got enough potions to fix everyone up? Thriss made a big show earlier, but if you’re counting on being healed up every time you take a hit, you’d best run away now. Only way to stay healthy is not get hit.”</p>
<p>The other soldiers nodded and Lim looked worried for a second.</p>
<p>“But we won’t be in that much danger, right?”</p>
<p>“Hah! Against Centaurs? They might have trouble in the jungle, but get them on a flat plain and they’ll pepper you full of arrows so fast that you won’t even have time to reach for your shield.”</p>
<p>“Centaurs ain’t the problem here. I’m more worried about the Magehammer Company. They’ve got some nasty mages.”</p>
<p>“They’re not <em>all</em> going to be mages, are they?”</p>
<p>Again, everyone laughed at Lim. He flushed and turned red, but eyed Geneva sideways. She pretended not to notice—he couldn’t have been more than sixteen, and she was twenty four, going on twenty five.</p>
<p>“They’ve probably got mostly warriors and only a few mages in each squad, if that. And we’ve got our own mages so we needn’t worry about being completely alone. But mark me, there are going to be some nasty spells out there.”</p>
<p>“We’re not going to be fighting them the entire time, though, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course not! Do you think we’re going to kill them down to the last man? No, we’re trying to push back their company. If we kill enough of them—or take enough land, their Commander will probably sign a peace treaty. Then we all get paid and we can get drunk for a week or two.”</p>
<p>Clara lectured Lim as Geneva listened with rapt attention. She’d been in this world, in Baleros, for a week, and she’d survived mainly by pretending she knew the basics of this world. But she was still woefully undereducated, and the people marching with her were the first people she could candidly ask questions of.</p>
<p>“The Magehammer Company is trying to protect a goldmine that Centaur tribe found. That’s what I heard. They’re going to split the profits, but surprise, the Burning March Company claims that’s their mine because they’ve got the contract on this area.”</p>
<p>Several other people nodded sagely. Lim looked confused.</p>
<p>“But who’s right?”</p>
<p>“Who cares? We get paid to fight, not take sides. Don’t go making an enemy of a Company, boy.”</p>
<p>The bald soldier cuffed Lim. From what Geneva understood, Baleros was a continent unique in that despite there being nations and countries and kingdoms and so on, much of the fighting was done by mercenary groups, ranging from smaller troops like the Raverian Fighters to huge Companies comprised of multiple regiments of soldiers who were almost constantly embroiled in conflict.</p>
<p>“Of course, the Companies are like nations themselves.”</p>
<p>Clara looked surprised when Geneva asked her about it.</p>
<p>“New to Baleros, are you? Well, there are countless companies who have their own cities and towns where they base themselves. They have contracts and earn income from protecting places, and they send out their own armies to fight. The big ones have influence, representatives in other nations, even entire merchant organizations that cater only to them!”</p>
<p>Geneva nodded.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard the Four Companies of Baleros are the biggest. But I don’t know anything about them…why doesn’t everyone join up with them?”</p>
<p>“The Four Companies? Well, sure, if you’re an officer or a veteran they treat you well. But you can get better pay and opportunities to loot and level up in a mercenary group. Besides, when they go to war, people die by the tens of thousands.”</p>
<p>The bald man shook his head and spat. He was called ‘Old Man’ by a lot of the soldiers, but his actual name was Fortum. He used the spear in his hands like a walking stick as he talked, his mouth a mix of yellow teeth and conspicuous gaps.</p>
<p>“They’re all somewhat equal—well, it’s not as if they fight against each other most of the time. That would upset the balance, and if two of the Great Companies fought, the other two would attack the winner, if there even was one. But now that we’re mentioning it…Lim, you know the Four Great Companies, right? Tell the young lady about them?”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>Lim jumped and blushed. He cleared is throat nervously.</p>
<p>“Well, there’s the Armored Legion—the Dullahans—”</p>
<p>“Dullahans and a lot of bastards in armor. They base themselves in the north, mainly. They’ve got at least eighteen cities under their protection.”</p>
<p>Fortum interrupted Lim.</p>
<p>“Well yeah, but their leader’s a Dullahan, right?”</p>
<p>“As if that made a difference! They’ll take anyone with good armor. I doubt you’d get much work with them, Geneva. All their troops are tough as nails and their Dullahans have metal armor.”</p>
<p>The Old Man nodded to some of the Dullahans marching in a squad ahead of them. Geneva looked, and saw those Dullahans had ‘skin’ made of wood, not metal. She’d been surprised when she saw that, but apparently while Dullahans were all covered in armor save for their head, the quality of that armor varied.</p>
<p>“Not a lot of treatment needed for people wearing armor, right?”</p>
<p>“Maybe.”</p>
<p>Geneva could just imagine the injuries that might occur. Crushed bones, pierced armor—she shuddered as she imagined trying to restore a smashed hand without equipment. She wasn’t even sure she could help someone who got cut by a sword here.</p>
<p>“Anyways, they’re always at odds with the Flowing Wind Company. Mainly Centaurs, but they have a lot of mounted soldiers as well. They specialize in fast strikes—one second you think you’re safe and the next their armies will come riding down on you during the night. Not so great in jungles and higher up, though.”</p>
<p>Baleros wasn’t all deep forest and jungles. It had wide open plains and wonderfully scenic landscapes—or so Geneva had been told. If it was anything like America, she expected the northern part of the continent would be far colder.</p>
<p>She’d been born in Wisconsin, and although she was Italian by heritage and had often visited her homeland—this humidity was killing her. She would give anything for a bit of snow. Apparently it was <em>winter</em>, but for some reason it was delayed. She’d heard Winter Sprites mentioned in this context, but Geneva still had no idea what that meant.</p>
<p>“The Armored Legion and Flowing Wind companies are specialized, but the other two are more diverse. The Forgotten Wing for instance—”</p>
<p>“That’s the army with the Fraerling who leads them, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“The Titan himself. Yeah, they rose into prominence two decades back. Crushed countless other companies, and their second-in-command is the Titan, the greatest [Strategist] in the world.”</p>
<p>Fortum nodded, and Geneva wondered what a Fraerling was. The Old Man cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“Mind you, their Commander is just as terrifying. The Titan leads their armies while the Three-Color Stalker takes down enemy officers. They haven’t as many long-term contracts, but they’re a rising force, and they’ve been fighting with the Iron Legion. Now, the last company—”</p>
<p>“<em>Ambush! Centaurs in the trees!</em>”</p>
<p>Someone screamed the words from up ahead. Geneva looked up, and then, suddenly, there were arrows.</p>
<p>Geneva stared at shadows as they burst from the trees. She felt something blur past her face, and then someone tackled her from the side. Lim’s terrified face hovered above her as Geneva hit the ground and all the air rushed out of her lungs.</p>
<p>Stunned, she saw a Centaur covered in warpaint and nothing else leap over her. He had a bow in his hands and he nocked it and fired three times. Three soldiers around him fell, crying out, and then he was running into the trees.</p>
<p>He had raven hair, and tanned skin. And he had a bracelet which shone with magical light. The Centaur’s galloping footsteps faded, and only then did Geneva sit up.</p>
<p>The first thing she heard were screams, and confused shouting.</p>
<p>“<em>Attack, attack!</em>”</p>
<p>“Go after them!”</p>
<p>“No, hold position! Get some potions out here!”</p>
<p>“They’re all <em>dead!</em>”</p>
<p>“Where are the archers!?”</p>
<p>“Potions! I need—!”</p>
<p>And then, a voice from next to her.</p>
<p>“Clara!”</p>
<p>Lim stared at one of the fallen soldiers. Geneva looked over and saw Clara was weakly grasping at a shaft buried in her collarbone. It felt as though the ground had dropped underneath Geneva.</p>
<p>Arrow wound. A deep shot. Probably hit bone; not bad blood loss yet, but Clara’s eyes were wide and she was gasping. First stage of hypovolemic shock?</p>
<p>Lim staggered over to the female soldier. He choked as he stared at the shaft in her body and reached for it.</p>
<p>Geneva was still in shock, but her training and instincts took over.</p>
<p>“Don’t touch her!”</p>
<p>She snapped at Lim as he reached for the arrow. Geneva looked around. Fortum was watching out for the archers, but other soldiers were already charging into the forest.</p>
<p>“Fortum! Help me lie her down.”</p>
<p>He hesitated, but then abandoned his spear and helped Lim lie Clara down. She was gasping and her face was white as Geneva studied the arrows.</p>
<p>Geneva had gone through a surgical rotation in medical school, but while her lessons had included information about how to fix up people with bullet wounds and knife wounds, no one had even thought to include a seminar about arrows. But the basic principle Geneva understood. She could either leave the arrow in and let it fester, or get it out.</p>
<p>The only problem was in <em>how</em> to get it out. Geneva had nothing like a scalpel and she was well aware of the dangers of infection. The arrow tip might be poisoned for all she knew. She had to get it out, but if Clara died then what was the point? Moreover—she’d have to cut down to the arrowhead itself to extract it.</p>
<p>She had butterflies in her stomach, but Geneva’s mind was cold. You had to be cold to work as a surgeon. And quick, too. There was no room for hesitation in the emergency room or the battlefield.</p>
<p>“I need a knife, and hot water. And a healing potion.”</p>
<p>She could bypass the injury she was about to inflict on Clara by using a potion. But there was still the issue of infection—did a healing potion erase bacteria or was that still an issue?</p>
<p>“Sergeant Thriss!”</p>
<p>Lim shouted desperately, and then the big man was running to them, a healing potion in his hands. He looked down at Clara, and then at Geneva.</p>
<p>“Can you save her?”</p>
<p>“I can.”</p>
<p>Geneva said it instantly. Even without a healing potion, the wound wasn’t that bad. And with it, she could take the arrowhead out. The only issue was whether the trauma of the surgery would be too much for Clara.</p>
<p>When she asked about the issue of infection, Thriss shook his head.</p>
<p>“The better type of healing potion gets rid of poison and all kinds of nasty problems, but we’ve only got cheap stuff.”</p>
<p>“Fine. Then I need a fire <em>now.</em>”</p>
<p>“[Mage]! I need a mage over here!”</p>
<p>Thriss <em>roared</em> and a man in robes ran over. He blinked when Geneva demanded a fire, but he immediately boiled the pot of water just by putting a glowing hand on the metal. Geneva dunked the knife Fortum handed her in the water and tried to breathe slowly.</p>
<p>She only had a knife. She needed—she needed clamps, forceps, retractors—she needed a damn <em>scalpel</em>. This dagger had all the precision of a baseball bat. And she needed something to dig around in the injury with.</p>
<p>“I need a spoon. Or—a metal knife. Something small I can work with.”</p>
<p>Lim went running, and Geneva knelt by Clara. The woman was trying to sit up, but Geneva held her down.</p>
<p>“Clara? It’s going to be okay. Alright? But I need to get that arrow out of you, so it’s going to hurt.”</p>
<p>“You can help me?”</p>
<p>Clara smiled at Geneva, but there was worry in her eyes. Geneva nodded and tried to smile. Clara should be under anesthesia, but she was bleeding and <em>there was no time.</em></p>
<p>“Here!”</p>
<p>Lim came back with the things Geneva had requested. She dunked them in the boiling water and took a breath. Thriss was watching her, and Fortum was staring with concern at the arrow.</p>
<p>“The healing potion’ll close the wound, but the shaft has to come out. It has to be cut.”</p>
<p>She nodded at the older man.</p>
<p>“Hold her down. Clara? I need you to hold still, alright?”</p>
<p>Clara clenched her teeth.</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Lim’s face went pale as Geneva drew the dagger out of the boiling water. She barely felt the scalding heat; her entire concentration was on Clara’s bleeding wound. Go in fast; avoid major arteries and veins. Dig the arrowhead out and make sure it hadn’t fragmented, then use the healing potion. Time was her only enemy. And pain.</p>
<p>“I’m going to start.”</p>
<p>So saying, Geneva slowly began to cut into Geneva’s shoulder, next to the shaft. The woman <em>inhaled</em>, and Geneva paused as she saw the blood.</p>
<p>But she’d done this before. She’d cut open people and cadavers. But never—</p>
<p>Never when they were alive.</p>
<p>It was so hard. But she had to do it. People thought doctors swore the Hippocratic Oath when they learned to practice medicine. There was that famous line, ‘Do no harm’. <em>Primum non nocere. </em></p>
<p><em>Bullshit. Doctors had to cause harm. It was the only way to do surgery. The only way to save lives.</em></p>
<p><em>So Geneva began to cut. She sawed flesh apart and Clara screamed. Fortum and another man held her down as the woman herself tried not to move, and Geneva cut fast and deep.</em></p>
<p><em>“Oh dead gods. Lords and ladies. Nonononono—”</em></p>
<p><em>Lim was right in Geneva’s ear, reacting viscerally to the surgery. He backed away, hands over his mouth, and then Geneva heard retching and splattering. He’d vomited! Of all the—</em></p>
<p>“<em>Goddamnit! </em>Get him <em>out</em> of here!”</p>
<p>Geneva shouted and Thriss pulled Lim away. The vomit stank in the hot air and Geneva was worried it would attract bugs. But she didn’t hurry her movements; she was working as fast as she could and didn’t dare rush for fear of causing more damage.</p>
<p>Cut down. Through tissue. She didn’t have time to remove the blood, even if she could. No sponges. Clara was screaming, but there! There was the arrowhead.</p>
<p>It was deep. And now Geneva could see it was touching bone. But she’d opened a path so she gently tried to remove the arrowhead by pulling the shaft out.</p>
<p>She <em>had</em> to get the arrowhead out. It was a sharp object, unlike a bullet or something the tissue could heal around. Even a healing potion would probably only form an abscess around the arrowhead until Geneva could get it out. It was better to slice up Clara’s flesh to retrieve it rather than leave it in.</p>
<p>If it was lodged in the bone, she’d have to pull it out with her crude forceps. Geneva prayed as she gently twisted and pulled the shaft out. Clara was moaning, deep and agonized. But Geneva’s attention was all on the shaft. She could feel the arrowhead moving, coming up and then—</p>
<p>The bloody head of the arrow came up, crimson with Clara’s blood. Geneva stared at it grimly and cast it aside.</p>
<p>“Good!”</p>
<p>Thriss exclaimed and uncorked the potion as soon as he saw the arrowhead. But Geneva stopped him and shook her head.</p>
<p>“I need to disinfect the wound first. Reboil that water.”</p>
<p>It was a popular myth that alcohol would disinfect wounds. While that was true, it would also inflame the injury. Alcohol was good for sterilizing equipment; but in this case the hot water Geneva used to wash the injury and blood was adequate.</p>
<p>Clara screamed into the rag Fortum had given her to bite with, but in a few seconds Geneva was pouring the healing potion over the wound. She did it slowly; Geneva the person wanted to heal the wound as fast as possible, but Geneva the surgeon wanted to observe the potion’s effects. What she saw fascinated her.</p>
<p>The healing potion was clearly some kind of agent that accelerated the body’s natural processes. It did not create new skin; rather, it made the existing tissue close up at an extremely accelerated rate. Even as Geneva watched the skin close together and the angry red color of the flesh returned to its normal state, she wondered how the potion would work on another kind of injury.</p>
<p>They would probably do nothing for more advanced breaks, unless the bones were set properly. Even then, they would have limits—these potions couldn’t heal severed limbs, and indeed they would inhibit reattachment if used incorrectly—even if that was possible to do with just potions.</p>
<p>Did the potions age the skin? Would they cause cancerous growths or tumors in the long run if they continued to accelerate the reproduction of cells? What would their effect be on such an affliction?</p>
<p>Thoughtfully, Geneva corked the potion and handed it back to Thriss. He looked surprised, but she’d only used up half of the bottle. Despite the invasive surgery, she hadn’t cut <em>that</em> deep into Clara for the arrowhead.</p>
<p>“Only a bit of healing potion. That’s good work.”</p>
<p>Geneva just nodded. Clara was feeling her arm and sitting up, shuddering. Tears had streaked through the blood and grime on her face, but her skin was whole and unscarred now. She hugged Fortum as the soldier gripped her shoulder.</p>
<p>It was hard to meet her eyes. Geneva stood up and looked at Thriss. He was looking at her too, different than before. There was a newfound respect in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Not many [Healers] could remove an arrowhead from a screaming person like that. I guess [Doctors] are stronger, eh?”</p>
<p>“Some are. But I don’t have even a quarter of the equipment I need for proper surgery. If Clara wasn’t the only one injured, or if the arrow had hit her in the gut—”</p>
<p>Thriss shook his head.</p>
<p>“Bad business. Those Centaur bastards are good shots. Your friend was lucky she only got stuck once; I’ve seen them hit a soldier three times in as many seconds.”</p>
<p>He pointed at the other bodies lying on the ground. Their eyes had been closed, but Geneva could see the arrows that had struck them around the heart or in the necks and faces.</p>
<p>“If you can save more lives, I’ll see to getting you what you need. What things do you want? A sharp dagger, we can give you.”</p>
<p>“I need more than that. I need things to open skin and hold flesh. Tweezers, a digging instrument—”</p>
<p>Thriss’ face changed as Geneva described the tools. He shook his head.</p>
<p>“Talk to the [Quartermaster]. I’ll see to it you can take what’s needed.”</p>
<p>“I also need something to clean my tools. Not just water, although I’ll need a fire to boil water. But I need alcohol—a strong spirit.”</p>
<p>Disinfectants. Could she make some kind of iodine? She desperately needed an antibiotic, but what?</p>
<p>Thriss made a troubled face.</p>
<p>“We have an alcohol ration. I suppose I can have the quartermaster give you some. But if I see soldiers drinking—”</p>
<p>“If they’re drinking, it’s because I need them to stop screaming.”</p>
<p>“True enough. Well then, you do what’s needed. But it was good you were here. Damned good. I’ve seen too many friends cutting a shoulder open and rooting for the damn arrowhead, or pouring a potion on top and having the wound fester.”</p>
<p>He nodded to Geneva and left her. Slowly, the disturbed line of soldiers began to regroup, and in ten more minutes they were marching again. But this time they walked in silence, and Geneva stood alone. She’d washed the blood off her clothes and hands, but the other soldiers stayed away from her.</p>
<p>Apparently, it was one thing to kill your enemy, and another to hurt your friends, even if that was to help them. Geneva didn’t care at the moment. When they finally made camp she just fell into bed after a quick meal. She was <em>exhausted.</em></p>
<p>But a voice spoke in her ears before she slept.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Doctor Level 4!]</p>
<p>[Skill – Hygienic Hands obtained!]</p>
<p>[Skill – Lesser Resistance: Infection obtained!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She didn’t understand Skills that well. Well she did—it wasn’t a hard concept to grasp. But Geneva didn’t precisely understand what <em>her</em> Skills did, and that bothered her greatly.</p>
<p>As she woke up and felt a night’s worth of bug bites start to itch, Geneva wondered what [Hygenic Hands] did. Did that mean she didn’t have to wash her hands? Surely not. She had a bit of grime on them even now.</p>
<p>Or—was there some kind of effect on them that would nullify any bacteria on her hands? If she touched something—like feces, for example—was she cleansing the object or would it return to being filthy the moment it left her hands? Did the effect apply to the tools she used, or was it <em>just </em>her hands?</p>
<p>For that matter, how much resistance was ‘Lesser Resistance’, anyways? Was her immune system simply stronger, or would she slowly develop an immunity or would the virus or infection not affect her as badly as someone without this Skill?</p>
<p>She wished she had a microscope. That would answer so many questions, and besides which, this world was a veritable treasure trove of new information. Geneva would have given anything to study how the Lizardfolk and Dullahan’s internal biology worked or even what effect magic had on the particles in the air when it was cast. She had so many questions.</p>
<p>But as she walked to breakfast where a silent Dullahan was serving bowls of soup and chunks of dry bread to the soldiers, Geneva’s thoughts made way for a more pressing issue.</p>
<p>How would the others respond to her now that they’d seen her performing surgery? Moreover, how would Clara react?</p>
<p>She needn’t have worried. True, Lim hesitated, but he still moved over as Geneva sat with Fortum and the other Human soldiers from this morning, and Fortum grunted at her in a friendly sounding way. The others chatted or blinked in bleary silence as was their preference, but none looked at Geneva too oddly.</p>
<p>Except for Lim, that was. He still looked uneasy when he met Geneva’s eyes, but Clara gave her a one-armed hug the instant she saw her in the morning.</p>
<p>“Looks like a [Doctor]’s more use’n I thought, isn’t that right? You cut that arrow out of my arm in a thrice, and it doesn’t feel the slightest bit bad now!”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I didn’t have anything to stop the pain.”</p>
<p>Fortum shook his head.</p>
<p>“You were faster than anyone I’d ever seen, girl. Don’t you worry. Clara knows you had to get that arrowhead out.”</p>
<p>“It was worth me screaming and bleeding for that.”</p>
<p>Clara nodded seriously. She tapped her arm.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard stories of folks who used a potion without pulling the arrowhead out. They rot from the inside and die screaming. No amount of potion’ll fix that.”</p>
<p>“You were so <em>calm.</em>”</p>
<p>Lim burst out at last. He looked at Geneva, wide-eyed.</p>
<p>“How did you know how to get the arrow out? Do all [Doctors] have a skill? What level do you learn to do all that?”</p>
<p>Geneva frowned. She hadn’t learned that from her class, but the idea that someone could learn something like surgery from just leveling up a few times was…concerning. Fortum scowled and cuffed Lim lightly.</p>
<p>“It’s rude to ask her level, boy.”</p>
<p>Even asking about Classes was considered somewhat rude unless the information was volunteered first. It was a personal question and an important one; knowing someone’s exact levels and classes meant you could tell how powerful or useful they were. Geneva only shrugged.</p>
<p>“I’m not a high level [Doctor], but I’ve been trained to do surgery and other types of medicine.”</p>
<p>“Surgery? You mean cutting someone open like yesterday…?”</p>
<p>Lim looked uneasy, and another soldier smacked him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“We’re <em>eating</em>, boy.”</p>
<p>Geneva nodded. She had no issues swallowing her food.</p>
<p>“If I have to. But I normally have a lot more tools. I was working with what I could scrounge, but next time…do you know where I can get tweezers? Even wooden ones would do.”</p>
<p>“Someone’ll have them. But if you want some, there’s bound to be someone with a wood working Skill in this crowd.”</p>
<p>Fortum pointed this out, and Geneva latched on to the suggestion.</p>
<p>“Do you think I could pay them or get them to make me a few tools?”</p>
<p>Metal would be far better, but anything was better than nothing. The Old Man nodded as he chewed at his bread slowly, breaking it down with saliva and soup so his few teeth could do the rest of the job.</p>
<p>“I reckon they’ll do it for free, even if the sergeant don’t insist. After today, everyone’s going to want to give you as much help as they can in case they’re the ones with a hole in their gut.”</p>
<p>“Can you fix that, too?”</p>
<p>Geneva smiled wryly, but her stomach twisted.</p>
<p>“Let’s not find out right now, okay?”</p>
<p>Everyone laughed, and soon the soldiers were roused by Thriss shouting and back on the march. But the [Sergeant] found Geneva as she was walking with the others.</p>
<p>“A word.”</p>
<p>He led her away from the others, and then pressed a small key into her hands. It was made of iron and sturdy. Geneva blinked at it.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“It’s a key. To the chest of healing potions in the supply wagon.”</p>
<p>Thriss stared seriously at Geneva.</p>
<p>“You’re new, but after yesterday, me and the other officers agreed you should have it. Mark me, though. If any potions are missing or you don’t lock up, there will be hell to pay.”</p>
<p>She met his eyes.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I won’t steal.”</p>
<p>“Good! I just want you to know how important what you’ve got is. Don’t lose it, or if you do—tell me at once. We can’t lose that key.”</p>
<p>Geneva nodded again and Thriss clapped her on the shoulder with one hand. Geneva stared at the supply wagon as she pushed the key deep into her pockets. It <em>was</em> an important thing to be entrusted with. The potion chest was probably the most valuable thing this battalion of mercenaries was carrying.</p>
<p>It sat at the center of the line of troops, in a wagon that was guarded by veterans. All the precious supplies were held there, but the potions had the double protection of the chest. Geneva could see why. Even a magical sword wasn’t as valuable as the hundred plus bottles of magical liquid.</p>
<p>The others made no comment as she rejoined them on their march, although Fortum did eye Geneva speculatively. But none of them looked like thieves, and so Geneva found the time to talk to some other soldiers and ask about fashioning some wooden tools.</p>
<p>They were all friendly, even the Lizardfolk. The few Dullahans and Centaurs were somewhat aloof, but Geneva’s [Doctor] status seemed to make her special.</p>
<p>No one seemed to really know what a [Doctor] was. Oh, they were familiar with [Healers] and regarded [Doctors] as a version of that class, but Geneva felt like she was being treated like a witchdoctor or some kind of medicine woman or midwife.</p>
<p>This world didn’t need [Doctors]. Not like her world. That knowledge made Geneva’s chest hurt and loosen at the same time. Was she useless?</p>
<p>No—no, Clara had still needed her help to remove the arrowhead. And things like plagues and infection might not be curable with magic alone. She had a place. And on this battlefield, at least Geneva could hand out potions.</p>
<p>The thought of going into battle was another worry that made Geneva’s stomach twist. But again, she’d had no choice. And at least here she could learn if she could still save lives or if all her skills were obsolete.</p>
<p>But to Geneva’s surprise, she found her expertise was needed before violence occurred again. As the soldiers had taken another break from marching and the sun was overhead, Thriss sought her out again.</p>
<p>“Geneva. A Dullahan wants to see you. He says it’s important.”</p>
<p>Curious, Geneva stood up and walked over to find a tall, dark-skinned man wearing armor that looked like bark was waiting for her. There was nothing visibly wrong with him, but for some reason the air smelled foul around him.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Are you sick?”</p>
<p>“No. Hurt.”</p>
<p>Without preamble, the Dullahan pulled off his arm. Geneva <em>gasped</em>, but Thriss didn’t seem shocked.</p>
<p>“Never seem a Dullahan do that? It’s not just heads.”</p>
<p>The Dullahan’s arm had come off smoothly, without any resistance. Geneva stared into the dark socket of his armor, but saw only purple light and a mist coming from the hole. Did they even have organs?</p>
<p>The Dullahan held the arm with one hand, and pulled a panel of the armor off. Geneva found her question answered and her stomach roiled as the horrible, rotting smell intensified and she saw what was causing it.</p>
<p>Underneath the Dullahan’s wooden armor—and now that Geneva saw what it was, she realized it was actually skin—his internal organs were clearly visible. Muscle and tendons were clearly visible; it was as if a normal Human had lost all their dermal layers but left their organs intact.</p>
<p>Dullahans were like <em>crustaceans! </em>They had shells – or perhaps they were more like insects, with exoskeletons they could remove. But what caught Geneva’s eye and made Thriss step back in disgust was the source of the smell.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a blood-filled injury like Clara’s. No, this was an infection. Pus and yellow liquid ran from the Dullahan’s arm as he held the wooden panel open, and Geneva saw the tissue and muscles around the yellow substance were raw and inflamed.</p>
<p>“Dead gods, that’s awful.”</p>
<p>Thriss wiped at his mouth with the back of his hand and spat. Geneva looked at the arm. Clearly, it was a long-term infection that hadn’t been treated. Her stomach tried to revolt, but Geneva held it firm. It wasn’t the worst thing she’d seen. Granted, it was up there in terms of disgusting, but she was a doctor. She was already thinking of how to treat the wound without any antibiotics.</p>
<p>“May I?”</p>
<p>To her surprise, the Dullahan handed Geneva his arm. She gently held it in her hands, noting the weight—it was quite heavy. She wrinkled her nose at the injury. What she wouldn’t give for gloves.</p>
<p>The wound was pus-filled and <em>stank</em>. Geneva stared at the Dullahan.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you get this treated earlier?”</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>“No one who can help with this. Healing potions no good. No [Healer] knows how to treat Dullahans.”</p>
<p>“But you think I can help?”</p>
<p>“[Doctor] is different. May help. Must help. Arm is bad.”</p>
<p>It was. Geneva noted the deterioration of tissue—the area had already begun to break down. She came to a quick decision.</p>
<p>“I’ll need more boiled water, and clean towels. In fact, I’ll need to boil the towels in the water first.”</p>
<p>Thriss eyed Geneva.</p>
<p>“Will this take long?”</p>
<p>“Not too long. Less than thirty minutes if I can get what I need. But I need to clean the wound now.”</p>
<p>He grunted.</p>
<p>“Good. Do it. And do it away from camp.”</p>
<p>Geneva led the Dullahan to a place where the soldiers couldn’t see—or smell—his injury and got to work. He followed her quietly, and silently. He was a very still figure, and his head didn’t exhibit many facial expressions. The infected wound had to <em>hurt</em>, but he was stoic. Was that a Dullahan trait?</p>
<p>To begin with, Geneva tried to figure out how the infection had started. But when she asked when he’d noticed the infection, the Dullahan only shook his head. He tapped the arm plate.</p>
<p>“Armor broke. Bad thing got in.”</p>
<p>Something like a bug or dirt? No wonder Dullahans tried to upgrade their armor. It was their skin, and any holes would expose them to all kinds of dangers. Geneva did her best with the wound. She would have done anything for antibiotics, but without them—</p>
<p>First she boiled water and cleaned two towels as best she could. Then, she requested and received some salt. She added it to another pot of water and boiled that. When the water was no longer scalding, she used it and the towels to clean the wound.</p>
<p>The Dullahan sat through it all, only wincing slightly which impressed Geneva again. She was touching his internal structure however lightly, and that had to be painful. But his only motion was to shoo away the insects that were attracted to his rotting flesh.</p>
<p>Soon, Geneva had cleared away the injury and she could see no traces of dirt or other containments. She gave the entire area one last dose of the saline solution—knowing it was a poor substitute for a proper antiseptic—and wished one last time for antibiotics.</p>
<p>“Is it done?”</p>
<p>The Dullahan looked at Geneva as she cleaned his armor plate. There was some…fleshlike substance on the back, and she tried to be as gentle with that was possible as well. How was he able to detach it from his arm? There was clearly still bloodflow. Was it just magic? Some kind of portal system?</p>
<p>She shook her head as she handed him the plate and he reattached it to his arm.</p>
<p>“No. Your infection is bad. Very bad. I have to clean it every few hours and let the pus drain. It will take time, you understand? But it must be cleaned, and the wound must breathe for a while.”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“It will heal?”</p>
<p>“You have a good chance.”</p>
<p>Geneva didn’t want to lie, but neither did she want to speak her mind. She <em>needed</em> antibiotics, somehow. But this wasn’t the place to find any. She hesitated. <em>Could</em> healing potions be of any help? Maybe…</p>
<p>“Hold on.”</p>
<p>When she came back with the healing potion she’d used on Clara, Geneva applied it sparingly to the Dullahan’s injury. The swelling reduced, although the injury didn’t look completely healed, which was something.</p>
<p>“I think this potion will help as well. I’ll use more tomorrow and if we’re lucky, your body will fight off the infection. Understand?”</p>
<p>He smiled at her, briefly.</p>
<p>“Good. Thank you.”</p>
<p>It was such a change to see his expressionless face move that Geneva blinked at him for a moment. But she realized he had to be terrified he’d lose his arm. She smiled back.</p>
<p>“It’s what I do. Now, we’d better get marching.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was the first time someone had come to her for help. Come to that, the Dullahan was her first real patient that had consulted with her. He wasn’t the last.</p>
<p>The Dullahan might not seem that talkative, but either he or Thriss was more chatty than Geneva thought, because word soon got out that she could do more than cut arrows out of people. Soon, Geneva had quite a number of discreet inquiries over medical issues of everything from boils and blisters to conditions like gout and even a surprising case of lacerations on a man’s groinal region. When Geneva asked where he’d gotten <em>that</em>, he just blushed and mumbled about lizardfolk.</p>
<p>By the end of that day, Geneva was confident enough to bring up the issue of hygiene to Thriss. He heard her out and scratched his head when she told him the soldiers needed to wash their hands regularly, not just when they were too dirty to stand.</p>
<p>“Soap? There is lye soap, but not nearly enough for the battalion.”</p>
<p>“Well, you need to buy some as soon as you can. If your soldiers keep eating without washing their hands regularly, some will get sick.”</p>
<p>Thriss made a face.</p>
<p>“How do you know that will help? Soldiers always get sick. It happens.”</p>
<p>“But it will happen <em>less</em> if they do what I say and practice proper hygiene. Trust me. I’m a [Doctor].”</p>
<p>He hesitated, but agreed to give it some thought.</p>
<p>“We’ll be joining up with the [Captain] and our unit’s [Strategist] soon enough. You can speak with them. Tomorrow we should reach the battlefield. Your talents will be needed soon enough then, so sleep deeply.”</p>
<p>Geneva nodded. She still had butterflies at the thought, but she was confident in her knowledge. She could help. She had to. This was what she’d been trained to do.</p>
<p>That night, Geneva slept on the ground, tossing and turning and thinking about antibiotics. She had to have some. Penicillin…how was that made again? Medical history hadn’t been high on her list of things to memorize, and she was regretting it now. She could recite almost every human body part and countless effects of drugs, but she didn’t know how to make penicillin from scratch. She needed the mold—but where would she even get it? Maybe a [Healer] would know, or some kind of class that dealt with herbs. An [Alchemist]?</p>
<p>Slowly, Geneva drifted off to sleep. She couldn’t get it now, but as soon as she was paid and got to a large settlement of some kind she’d start searching. For now, she had to rely on the healing potions. They would make her life so much easier. If disease and infection were her only enemies, she had a chance.</p>
<p>The soldiers had a chance.</p>
<p>Geneva believed that right up until the moment she heard the screaming and galloping of hooves that broke the silence of the night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“<em>Attack! Get up! We’re under attack!</em>”</p>
<p>Geneva heard the words as if they’d been screamed in her ear. She shot out of bed, first looking around for the danger, and then reaching for her pack. She left the sword behind as she blundered around in a panic.</p>
<p>People were struggling around in their bedding, shouting, adding to the confusion. Geneva nearly ran into Lim’s sword as he whirled around, looking for an enemy in the darkness.</p>
<p>“Geneva!”</p>
<p>Clara pulled Lim back and then Geneva found herself standing behind Fortum and some other soldiers from their group. They formed a circle in the darkness, watching every direction for enemies.</p>
<p>Someone was shouting for people to rally to him, but no one was inclined to move in the confusion. Geneva saw flashing shapes, and hoofbeats, but surpisingly, no screams. Then she heard the <em>crash</em> of wood and the sound of glass breaking and more galloping. And then…</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Slowly, order restored itself. Soldiers began to form up, and Geneva saw Thriss running through the camp, a huge mace in his hands. He ran past the group of soldiers and Geneva, and she heard a shout of rage.</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>Lim stared at the others, wide-eyed. Geneva had a sinking feeling in her stomach. Fortum glanced around, eying the confusion.</p>
<p>“Sounds like those Centaurs hit us again. Night raid. They were in and out quick, though.”</p>
<p>“No one’s wounded, though.”</p>
<p>Clara had a deeply troubled look on her face. She looked in the direction Thriss had gone.</p>
<p>“What was that sound? It sounded like breaking glass.”</p>
<p>Geneva knew. She didn’t want to know, but there was only one conclusion that bubbled up in her brain.</p>
<p>“The potions.”</p>
<p>Lim stared at her in horror and Fortum looked grim. Soon enough they saw that Geneva was right. Thriss and another big man carried the box out of the supply wagon and set it on the ground. Geneva saw the splintered wood and her heart stopped in her chest.</p>
<p>The precious chest of potions in the supply wagon had been smashed by something heavy. Inside, the fragile wrapped potions had been shattered, and the potion had leaked out of the sides. Only a few bottles held any potion at all—those Thriss and the other officers desperately tried to save, holding up the glass pieces and dripping as much potion into canteens and any containers they had on hand.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t enough. Not nearly. Geneva saw the looks on Fortum’s face and the other soldiers’. From over a hundred potions, their battalion’s’ supply had suddenly dwindled. They had maybe less than twenty bottles’ worth.</p>
<p>Thriss stared down at the broken chest. He stood up, and cursed, then shouted at another officer. And then his head turned. He looked at Geneva, and the look in his eyes told her that her worst fears were true. If they had no healing potions, then they only had her.</p>
<p>Geneva. A [Doctor]. But she had no Skills, not the ones that they needed. And she didn’t have the tools. She didn’t have—<em>anything!</em></p>
<p>Her stomach twisted. But now Fortum was staring at her, and Clara was as well. Lim was still staring at the broken chest with horror, but all the veterans were looking at Geneva. They knew.</p>
<p>Slowly, every eye turned to her. Soldiers and officers alike looked at Geneva, quiet fear in their eyes.</p>
<p>They couldn’t retreat. They were soldiers. But they feared death like all mortal beings. Without healing potions they had not a chance at all. Except if they had someone who could save them. So they put their faith in her. In Geneva, someone they barely knew, hoping because they had nothing else to cling to.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t do it. Geneva knew that. She was unprepared. She didn’t have anything she needed.</p>
<p>She was just twenty four years old. She was no renowned surgeon, no battlefield medic. She’d never trained. She wasn’t ready!</p>
<p>She was a surgeon with no tools. A student who hadn’t even finished her training. A practitioner without a license. A doctor alone.</p>
<p>But there was no one else. And she had a job to do. So Geneva stared at the box of potions and knew what was coming next. She clenched her hands so tight her knuckles cracked.</p>
<p>In the silence of the night, as the last drops of healing potion soaked into the jungle floor, Geneva felt death begin to walk at her side.</p>

		<p>“Bring in the next patient!”</p>
<p>Geneva snapped at the soldiers who had been assigned to her. They lurched into motion, slowly, too slowly. But they were injured as well; it was the only reason they hadn’t been sent back on the front lines. One man was limping; the other had taken a hatchet to the arm and couldn’t use it. They both should have been lying down, but she needed them.</p>
<p>The dead man’s gaze still haunted her vision. Geneva closed her eyes and banished the image. She sluiced more soapy water on her operating table, feeling it drain to the floor. Soapy water for disinfectant; she didn’t even have a place to drain the blood and gore. Already some bugs were buzzing around the tent. More would follow soon.</p>
<p>The tent flap opened. Geneva heard the woman moaning even as the soldiers carried her in on a makeshift pallet. Her arm was broken; the skin and bone deformed where something incredibly heavy had struck her.</p>
<p>Geneva sighed in relief. Here was someone she could fix. This woman would not die; she might not regain use of her arm, but she would not die.</p>
<p>She would live. And she stared at Geneva with horror in her eyes. It was probably the blood that covered her. Geneva paid no heed. Crushed bone and skin. She had no IV or drip—she had to prevent hypotension. The skin and bones—swelling. Would the arm have to be amputated?</p>
<p>No. No. Not yet. Check the fracture and set the bones. Geneva took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“This will hurt.”</p>
<p>She warned the female soldier and set to work. Geneva closed her ears to the screams as she worked. It was cruel. Cruel to do this. She was causing the poor woman pain, but it had to be done. There was no one else to save her, no healing potions to help her. Without Geneva hurting her, the woman would never be able to lift anything with her arm again. There were no healing potions left.</p>
<p>Geneva was all the battalion had.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We will not be receiving any more healing potions in the near future.”</p>
<p>Thriss told Geneva that directly. The battalion had camped, and they were on the eve of their entry into the battle. Geneva stared at him as she stood in the sergeant’s marginally larger tent in their camp.</p>
<p>The air was hot and humid. It was dark, but a few lanterns had been set out. They were already attracting swarms of nocturnal bugs in the dense jungle.</p>
<p>The soldiers had camped just on the fringes of one of the dark, dense jungles that made Baleros such a nightmare to do battle in. The Centaur tribe’s goldmine was located deep within the labyrinth of trees and overgrown fauna, which meant that the attacking mercenary groups – the Burning March company hired forces like the Raverian Fighters – had to push into the jungle. It also meant close combat fighting where ambushes could happen at any moment. It would be desperate and intense, and it was made far worse because Geneva’s company had no healing potions.</p>
<p>To be more accurate, they had twenty. But Thriss had already made it clear that Geneva would not see any of them.</p>
<p>“We’ve distributed half-shares among our officers and veterans. The regular soldiers will have you, and if we can hold for a few days we’ll get another shipment of potions. But it will take time.”</p>
<p>Geneva stared at him. Thriss wasn’t meeting her eyes as he stared at a map on the table. He wasn’t the commander of the company, but he was one of the officers in charge of their battalion. And he had apparently drawn the straw to tell her the bad news.</p>
<p>“You want me to act as a doctor for the entire camp?”</p>
<p>There were over six hundred soldiers in their battalion. Geneva knew not all of them would be injured at once, but—</p>
<p>“I can’t do that. I don’t have the tools for surgery. I need assistants, an operating space, <em>time—</em>”</p>
<p>“We’ll clear an area for you to work in. We’ll put you well behind the front lines so don’t worry about that.”</p>
<p>Geneva wasn’t worried about enemy soldiers at the moment. She stared Thriss in the eye.</p>
<p>“I cannot save these soldiers. Not without healing potions.”</p>
<p>“You are all we have.”</p>
<p>Thriss looked at Geneva finally. He met her eyes for a second, and then glanced away. She knew he had a full healing potion in one of the water flasks at his side. But the regular soldiers wouldn’t be getting any potions. Because they were new recruits; expendable.</p>
<p>“Our other battalions can’t spare any potions from their supplies. They’ve been hard pressed too. And the closest force to us is the Burning March 6<sup>th</sup> Battalion. They’ve refused to give us any potions as well.”</p>
<p>The big man’s hand clenched. Geneva just stood and thought.</p>
<p>“If I do this…I can’t guarantee I’ll save any lives. I can bandage wounds and make tourniquets, but any deep cut, anything worse than a flesh wound—”</p>
<p>“Do your best. That’s all we can ask.”</p>
<p>Thriss stared back at the map. His voice grew quiet.</p>
<p>“It will get intense tomorrow. We’re being sent in to fight against the Magehammer Company. We will flank them. Even if we don’t run into their mages, there will be more than enough people for you to work on.”</p>
<p>What was she supposed to say to that? What was she supposed to do? Geneva stared helplessly at the man in front of her. He knew she couldn’t do this. But he was telling her to do it anyways.</p>
<p>“Can’t we wait until we receive supplies?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>He said it flatly.</p>
<p>“We have to provide support. The battle is not going well. If an entire battalion pulls out of its position, we will give the enemy too much of an advantage.”</p>
<p>“So instead you’ll send all of these soldiers to their deaths.”</p>
<p>“You have your orders. Carry them out.”</p>
<p>Geneva stood straight in the tent, feeling as though she’d been slapped. Her voice was taut and cold.</p>
<p>“The gods are dead in this world, Thriss. But tell me, do you believe in immortal souls?”</p>
<p>“Souls?”</p>
<p>The [Sergeant] looked at Geneva. He looked old, and lost, and uncertain.</p>
<p>“I believe I do. I believe in souls, even if there are no gods to judge them.”</p>
<p>Geneva nodded slowly. Her own soul ached. But she had no choice.</p>
<p>“In that case, I hope the soldiers who look up to you have mercy on your soul. Because their deaths are on you.”</p>
<p>She turned and walked out the camp tent. Geneva listened to the insects buzzing and the sounds of the jungle at night. She whispered the words as she walked back to her sleeping spot.</p>
<p>“May they have mercy on mine as well.”</p>
<p>The next day, the 4<sup>th</sup> Battalion of the Raverian Fighters engaged in battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Geneva remembered the day as vivid scenes set to the backdrop of screams and blood and gore. Only a few things stood out to her clearly.</p>
<p>She remembered standing at the edge of the camp as Lim, Clara, Fortum, and the other soldiers prepared to enter the fray. She remembered the look in their eyes as they’d stared at her.</p>
<p>“Stay safe, girl.”</p>
<p>Fortum had advised her as he and the other soldiers tightened straps and made sure both armor and weapons were secure. He looked at her seriously.</p>
<p>“You’re all we’ve got. If some fool gets you, we’re all dead men walking. You keep well clear of the fighting.”</p>
<p>“I will. I’ll be waiting in case any of you need me.”</p>
<p>The old man had paused then, and looked at Geneva seriously. There was no blame in his eyes, or fear like there was in Lim’s when the young man looked at her. His voice was soft.</p>
<p>“Don’t blame an old man, but I hope I don’t see you today.”</p>
<p>“I won’t. Stay safe.”</p>
<p>And then they’d left. Geneva had stood in the camp, in the empty tent she’d set up, trembling.</p>
<p>To her surprise, not all the soldiers had been sent out in the first wave. Of course; they had to be rotated and a reserve was necessary to keep the enemy from ambushing the headquarters. So she’d enlisted a few men and women and one Lizardfolk and had them wait near her tent. She needed assistants. Even if they couldn’t help in the surgery, they could at least lift the bodies—</p>
<p>The wounded.</p>
<p>The first soldier arrived almost before Geneva could blink. One second she was trying to sit still, heart racing, waiting for what seemed like eternity, the next she heard the screams.</p>
<p>He’d been hit by an arrow in the first engagement. It had struck him in the leg and by the blood gushing from the wound, it had hit an artery. The soldiers carried him in and Geneva grabbed for bandages.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t—”</p>
<p>She almost asked them why they hadn’t made a tourniquet. But they were already pushing out the door.</p>
<p>Okay. Severed artery. She had to—</p>
<p>The man gasped, and Geneva’s heart stopped. He was awake but barely conscious. The blood loss had already taken his toll and he was limp and his face was pallid.</p>
<p>Move. Geneva tore her eyes away from his face and looked at the arrow. Blood was still oozing from the wound. She had to make a tourniquet.</p>
<p>Geneva wrapped the strip of twisted cloth as tightly around the upper part of his leg as she could. The blood flow cut off. That done, Geneva looked at the arrow.</p>
<p>It was just like the last injury. That was what she told herself. But this time she had to cut into the man’s leg. Her angle was bad, and the dagger wasn’t nearly as sharp as a scalpel. And when she got into the wound—</p>
<p>“Oh god.”</p>
<p>The arrow had indeed sliced through the artery, and Geneva was staring at the hole the extracted arrowhead had made. Somehow, she had to suture that. But she didn’t <em>have </em>sutures! Okay, first she had to grab the artery, but how could she? She had virtually no surgical tools—</p>
<p>“Forceps.”</p>
<p>Geneva fumbled with the wooden ones one of the soldiers had fashioned for her. She fumbled at the exposed artery, trying to grasp it until she succeeded. Desperately, Geneva hung on to that as she reached for a needle and thread.</p>
<p>The artery was severed; the only option she had was to ligate the wound. But doing that with basic thread and a sewing needle filled Geneva with dread. There was just no way she’d be able to do it properly.</p>
<p>But she didn’t have a choice. The needle could barely penetrate the artery, and the thread was already sticky with blood. The man was moaning, and Geneva had to adjust every time he moved. Slowly, she got the artery closed, but when she removed the tourniquet, one of her stitches broke. She had to reapply and dig around in the bloody mess again, and then wash the wound and close it up with more stitches.</p>
<p>She took too long. Geneva knew that in hindsight. Two more wounded soldiers had arrived and waited for over half an hour before she decided she’d done all she could. She shouted, and the soldiers came in and out. Geneva’s hands were shaking a bit after the operation, but she didn’t even have a second to rest.</p>
<p>The second injured person had been hit by a mage blast. And he was a Lizardfolk. Geneva stared at the curling smoke rising from the blackened crater in his side and decided to treat him as if the actual damage had been caused by fire or electricity. Some combination of the two.</p>
<p>She had no real way to treat him. But the worst part was that her patient was conscious. He screamed at her, and screamed harder when she tried to clean the wound with soapy water. He cut her face, and soldiers had to rush in and hold him down.</p>
<p>A skin graft was all she could think of, but Geneva knew she didn’t have the time or ability to do that. She could only clean the blackened scales and apply a rudimentary dressing of bandages. The soldiers carried the Lizardman out as he screamed curses at her.</p>
<p>The next patient only needed stitching and bandaging of several deep cuts on his arms. Geneva washed and stitched his skin together as the man yelped and cursed. She gave him garbled instructions to keep the wounds clean and not to strain himself—he stared at her as if she was crazy and told her he was going to be called back into the fighting soon enough.</p>
<p>Geneva paused then to catch her breath and wipe the sweat from her brow. An orange bug tried to land on her bloody hands and more were crawling up the table. She washed them off the table with soapy water and stomped them into the mud at the bottom of her tent. Then she told the soldiers to boil her more water and get her more cloth for bandages.</p>
<p>And then the next patient arrived. He was already dead. Geneva stared at his chest. He wasn’t breathing. She confirmed that by testing his pulse and checking to see if he was breathing. He was not. But the cut on his stomach was still leaking blood, and the two soldiers who’d stayed by his side were staring at Geneva with hope in their eyes.</p>
<p>“He’s dead. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>They refused to believe. One of the dead man’s friends pointed to his hands.</p>
<p>“He’s still alive! Look! His hands are moving!”</p>
<p>Geneva looked. The fingers on the dead man’s hands were twitching. She’d never seen a corpse do that, but she’d heard stories.</p>
<p>“Muscle spasms. I’m sorry, but there’s nothing I can do.”</p>
<p>The two stared at her. Geneva called for soldiers to take him out. A fight broke out when they tried to take the dead man’s body.</p>
<p>“<em>Liar!</em> He’s not dead! <em>He’s not dead!</em>”</p>
<p>“Deral! Get away—<em>Deral!</em>”</p>
<p>Geneva caught a fist as the soldiers fought with the other two. By the time they’d been subdued and the corpse had been taken out, Geneva’s cheek was swollen and the ground was muddy.</p>
<p>Then the next patient came in. He was alive and had taken a deep cut to the belly. Geneva had to call more soldiers to help. Three held him down while she had two more help him in the operation. But they were too slow, and too afraid. The man died while they hesitated.</p>
<p>And then the next patient came in. He was missing an eye, and he’d been cut badly. He screamed and thrashed. By this point Geneva was already exhausted and sweat kept running into her eyes. Her helper couldn’t even blot it off her head without getting in her way.</p>
<p>In another lifetime, in another world, Geneva’s college professor had once tried to make the analogy that surgery was like an orchestra. Each nurse and doctor in the operating room was like a player, and they all had their own part to play. If even one person slipped up, the entire melody, the entire piece fell apart.</p>
<p>He’d made the comparison poorly, and he’d completely flubbed the entire thing when he’d tried to compare general anesthesia to atmospheric lighting. But the analogy had stayed with Geneva.</p>
<p>A surgery was like an orchestra, or a band. Each person had their part to play. True, there were lead players and first violins, but even the most outstanding player could not make music alone. What was a concerto without the accompaniment? What good was a surgeon without the anesthesiologist to monitor the patient’s vitals, and her assistants to stop the bleeding and hand her tools?</p>
<p>What could one person do alone? Nothing. And worse, Geneva was still too inexperienced. She had no practice—no real experience with the injuries on the soldiers that were flooding into her tent. She had only studied theory, never tried to repair a collapsed lung or stitch together a burst stomach.</p>
<p>In an operating room, Geneva would have been the least-important member of the team. As a new intern or the youngest doctor, she would have been cutting sutures or cleaning and sterilizing the room before and after the surgery. No—as a student she would have been relegated to observational duty in some schools; just someone that had to keep out of the real doctor’s way at all costs.</p>
<p>But now Geneva found herself leading an orchestra of one, a lone singer on a stage dark with blood, with an audience that was growing with each hour. They screamed her name, and begged her to play music. But she was alone, untrained, unaided.</p>
<p>Yet they screamed her name. So Geneva sang alone. As the screams filled the jungle and the harsh buzzing of flies and larger insects filled the air she cut and bandaged and tried to catch life with her fingers.</p>
<p>It slipped away each time.</p>
<p>After the thirtieth patient, Geneva had to take a break. She staggered outside and threw up. The soldiers watched her anxiously, but Geneva didn’t care. She breathed deeply and drank water, rinsing out her mouth before she drank more, to replenish all the fluids she’d lost.</p>
<p>Her hands were shaking. They were still during the surgery, but now they shook uncontrollably. Geneva sat on a rock for a few seconds, trying to breathe.</p>
<p>They’d all died. Everyone who’d come in to her tent with a serious injury hadn’t gone back out. They’d passed away on that bloody, insect-infested table, screaming and crying and begging her to save them.</p>
<p>Someone else screamed. Geneva looked up and saw a man with no hand. It wasn’t a clean cut that had taken the hand either. It looked like something had <em>bit</em> the hand off.</p>
<p>“<em>Doctor!</em>”</p>
<p>His friend shouted at Geneva, white-faced. Friends were the worst. Geneva had already banned them from being anywhere near the tent.</p>
<p>Her mind raced. Part of her was already going over the things she’d need to do for a severed limb. It was listing all the things she didn’t have. But it was still possible, and every second she wasted was a second that man was closer to death.</p>
<p>“I can’t do this.”</p>
<p>She whispered the words as she stood up and walked back into the tent. She saved the man’s life, but the flesh around his hand already stank, and she feared infection would claim his arm. But there was nothing to do.</p>
<p>The next patient had taken three arrows to the legs. One had nicked an artery. He bled out before she could save him.</p>
<p>“More wounded! Where’s the damn <em>[Doctor]</em>!?”</p>
<p>Geneva turned, staggering, as she tried to finish her bowl of food. She’d stopped after—she had no idea, really. After a while the soldiers in her tent had turned into a blur.</p>
<p>Soldiers were carrying more wounded into the camp. Geneva looked at some of them and knew they would die. The living fought for space, trying to get their friends into line before the others. Nearly ten wounded this time. Geneva stood up, but then saw something strange.</p>
<p>Two soldiers were dumping a corpse next to the others. But it was not a corpse. Geneva could see it moving, and unlike the soldier who’d had muscle spasms, there was no way to imitate this.</p>
<p>“Wait! He’s not dead!”</p>
<p>Geneva ran forwards. The soldiers turned as she knelt at the side of the moving body. She paused when she saw the injury.</p>
<p>Half of his body had been blown away. A mage’s spell had struck him. Geneva was beginning to notice the signs. And what remained—Geneva blinked at the corpse.</p>
<p>It was a Human’s corpse, but something had happened to it. All the color seemed to have drained out of the skin, and what remained looked—wrong. He almost looked albino, but his hair was a dark red.</p>
<p>The soldier shook his head at Geneva.</p>
<p>“Selphid.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>They looked at her as if she was crazy for not knowing. Geneva stared back at them as the hand on the left side of the man’s body raised and lowered oddly, as if he was a puppet that someone was trying to move with only one string.</p>
<p>“They’re body-snatchers. Parasites. They live in corpses and move them about.”</p>
<p>Like brain slugs? Or—they lived <em>inside</em> of bodies? Geneva bent down and looked at the destroyed section of the body.</p>
<p>Something was squirming in the insides. Geneva looked closer, and saw where the left side of the corpse had been burned away, something was wriggling in the insides. Something was <em>living</em> in the body. Or it had been.</p>
<p>The corpse was clearly trying to move, but it was also clearly malfunctioning, or else the Selphid wasn’t able to control it after having half of its own body blown away. The soldier turned away in disgust, and his companion made the same expression.</p>
<p>“Leave it. The Selphids don’t have parts like normal folk. If it can’t get into another body it’ll die.”</p>
<p>“But it’s injured.”</p>
<p>“So? Selphids aren’t people.”</p>
<p>Geneva could see yellow fluid leaking from the squirming thing inside the body. She took a breath.</p>
<p>“I’m going to operate on it.”</p>
<p>“<em>What?</em>”</p>
<p>“It will die without help. And maybe I can transplant it. Put it in line with the others.”</p>
<p>The soldiers stared at Geneva, but they did what she said. Geneva stood up, and walked back into her tent.</p>
<p>The living flashed before her eyes, some becoming dead while she stood in her tent, and then sat when her legs started to give out. She could stitch people up, but the deeper wounds still eluded her. Her assistants still couldn’t move fast enough, and they kept rotating out of the tent. Some threw up as she was cutting into her victims, and even the bravest of them had to look away at times. Geneva had already gone numb to the smell of blood and feces as the injured and dead voided themselves.</p>
<p>And then the soldiers dumped a corpse on her table. Geneva stared at it until she remembered the Selphid. It was still twitching in the corpse, but weakly. The one eye of the dead man tried to move, but they couldn’t fix on her face.</p>
<p>“Can you hear me?”</p>
<p>Geneva spoke to the dead body. The leg kicked feebly. Geneva waited, but the mouth didn’t move.</p>
<p>“I am going to operate on you. I will try to save your life. But I need your permission.”</p>
<p>There were countless rules regarding malpractice Geneva had been taught in school. If she was in the emergency room in a hospital she would be judged by the professional standards of care and state laws. But here there was no oversight, just herself.</p>
<p>She had a duty to save lives. But she had no idea what Selphids were like. She could kill the creature in the person’s body just by slicing him open. So she had to ask.</p>
<p>“I will try to save you, but I have no idea how Selphids work. But I am a [Doctor]. I will do everything I can to keep you alive. But I need your permission.”</p>
<p>At last the mouth moved, but only once. The jaw fell open, and Geneva stared at the corpse. The Selphid couldn’t speak. She slowly put her hand in the corpses’. It was cold.</p>
<p>“If you want me to operate on you, grab my hand. If not, I will put you with the corpses.”</p>
<p>The hand was cold in her grasp. Geneva waited. Ten slow seconds passed, and she began to pull back her hand. Then the fingers <em>twitched</em> in her grasp. Geneva jerked away at the strange feeling, and then nodded.</p>
<p>“Okay. Try not to move. If I’m hurting you, let me know.”</p>
<p>It was a strange feeling as she cut into the man’s skin. She felt like she was doing an autopsy, but this time she was being extremely careful not to thrust in to any part of the body too deeply. She opened the stomach and then saw the Selphid.</p>
<p>It was stretching throughout the dead man’s nervous system. A green wriggling mass of tendrils moved weakly as Geneva stared at the body.</p>
<p>The soldiers in the room left. Geneva heard one race out of the tent and throw up as the tendrils tried to reach upwards. She stared. They were wrapped around organs—they seemed to have removed several and the Selphid had infiltrated the dead man’s stomach. It was a true parasite.</p>
<p>And it was alive. Geneva had to take hold of herself before her curiosity overwhelmed her. Slowly, she cut until she reached the half of the body that had been blown off.</p>
<p>There. Now she could see what was wrong. The Selphid might have been shielded inside the man’s body, but it had still been caught by the explosion. Where the body ended she saw it was bleeding some viscous, orange liquid.</p>
<p>“You’re injured. I need to stop the bleeding.”</p>
<p>Geneva reached for the Selphid and the needle, but the creature recoiled as she tried to grab it with a forcep. Part of it flowed away, and Geneva realized with a shock that this creature was semi-fluid. Stitches would be as useful as trying to block water with a net.</p>
<p>But the creature was dying, and it was—yes, it was bleeding out. Geneva thought quickly, and then raced out of her tent.</p>
<p>“Get me a piece of metal! A sword, a dagger—something smooth and flat! And a fire!”</p>
<p>When Geneva reentered the tent with a glowing brand of hot iron, the Selphid recoiled. But Geneva set the hot metal down next to the body and explained what she was going to do.</p>
<p>“I need to burn the injuries closed. That’s the only way I can stop the bleeding.”</p>
<p>The Selphid seemed to hesitate. Then it shifted, and Geneva saw several patches of bleeding among the green. She took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Hold still. This will hurt.”</p>
<p>She had no idea if the Selphid actually had nerves, but she got her answer as she pressed the hot metal down on the extended part of the Selphid, holding it still with a forcep in the other hand. She heard a <em>shriek—</em>a high-pitched sound that made her ear wax vibrate, and the Selphid went wild in her grip. But Geneva held on, and when she pulled the burning metal back the green of the Selphid had been discolored and the creature was shaking, but the bleeding had stopped.</p>
<p>The cauterization process was slow and agonizing for the Selphid, but when she was done, the creature lay in the body. It was moving very slowly now, and Geneva wondered if it was allergic to the air, or if it was still dying. The trauma alone might be killing it.</p>
<p>“I need another body.”</p>
<p>Geneva strode out of the tent and walked over to a group of soldiers amassing the dead in a pile to be burnt. The insects were thick, but she found a corpse—a woman who’d died of blood loss from having an artery cut. She told the soldiers to bring it to the tent and then carefully sliced the woman’s stomach open.</p>
<p>“I’m going to pick you up.”</p>
<p>She had to use her hands for that. The forceps weren’t strong enough. The body was warm to the touch as Geneva delved into the organs. The Selphid itself was <em>warm</em>. It weakly wrapped around her hands and she lifted it up.</p>
<p>It came out slowly. Pieces of the Selphid were still attached to organs, and Geneva had to pull with more force than she wanted. The creature screamed, but she eventually pried it loose. Slowly, she placed it in the opening she’d created in the dead woman’s stomach and waited.</p>
<p>The Selphid began to move. The bunched up segment of it slowly began to slither deeper into the body, slowly, very slowly. Geneva waited until it was all inside and then she sewed up the opening. And waited.</p>
<p>The body didn’t move. After a minute, Geneva realized the Selphid could be dead and she would never know. She waited a while longer, but then she had to turn away.</p>
<p>“Take the body and put it at the back of the line.”</p>
<p>She told the soldiers to take away the remains of the first corpse and watched as they brought in another wounded Dullahan. Geneva got back to work.</p>
<p>By the time the corpse came back, it was dark, Geneva was swaying, and the wounded had finally stopped coming in. Everyone who was injured had been treated, or their wounds weren’t life threatening, or they’d bled out while waiting.</p>
<p>The corpse was mildly warm to the touch, but it was only from the night air. Geneva hopefully checked the eyes, opening them and flashing lantern light into the empty gaze, but the body did not move. The Selphid was dead.</p>
<p>Exhausted, Geneva set the lantern down and walked away. She was too tired, too drained to even weep. She used the rest of the boiled water to wash herself—although her clothes were ruined—and walked into the camp where the surviving soldiers were eating.</p>
<p>To her surprise, Geneva heard laughter, and even cheering. She collected her food and found that Lim, Clara, and Fortum were all alive. And what was more, they all seemed to be in extremely good cheer.</p>
<p>“Geneva!”</p>
<p>Clara waved her over and edged over on the ground to give her a seat. Geneva sat and listened to the others laughing. She felt like she was in some strange other reality. Why was everyone so happy?</p>
<p>Fortum clapped Lim over the shoulder as he addressed Geneva.</p>
<p>“The kid was a hero! He killed at least eight soldiers in the battle today, and he got through it all with barely a scratch!”</p>
<p>“You’ll level tonight, boy!”</p>
<p>Lim blushed as he looked at Geneva. She stared back, her face empty. She’d held a man’s intestines in her hand. She’d stared at a hand and knew it was gone. It’d had to be amputated.</p>
<p>“A damn archer was aiming at me, and I’d caught my foot on a body so I couldn’t dodge. He raises his bow and then Lim runs him through from behind! Right through the leather armor! Just like that!”</p>
<p>A gaping hole so wide she could see the table underneath. She was out of time and the man was bleeding. Even if she could stop the bleeding all she could do was sew skin together. His organs were all severed. She watched him choking up blood.</p>
<p>“Geneva? What happened to you?”</p>
<p>Everyone was staring at her. Geneva looked up. They were looking at her face with concern.</p>
<p>“Geneva?”</p>
<p>Slowly, Geneva stared down at her food. She looked at the soldiers, some still covered with blood. The enemy’s blood. The blood of people they’d killed. People they’d injured, like the ones she’d tried to save.</p>
<p>Geneva stood up. Without a word, she walked away. She ate the food quickly by herself and then walked to her sleeping place. She paused to throw up everything she’d eaten, and vomited again and again until she was throwing up nothing but bile. Then she wept, long and hard. Geneva fell into her bedding and only woke when morning came.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Doctor Level 11!]</p>
<p>[Skill – Injury Sense obtained!]</p>
<p>[Skill – Sterile Equipment obtained!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Geneva had heard once that a surgeon improved by the number of patients that died under their blade. But this was far too literal. When she woke up and remembered the Skills she’d learned, she didn’t know if she wanted to cry or laugh hysterically.</p>
<p>She had more Skills. And they were valuable. The [Sterile Equipment] Skill would prevent infections, and the other one would allow her to pinpoint bleeding in theory. But at what cost?</p>
<p>They’d all died, all of her serious patients. Maybe she’d saved one or two? But regardless, that was a survival rate of less than 1%. She wasn’t a [Doctor]. She was a glorified coroner who helped kill the living.</p>
<p>Geneva ate in silence with the others this morning. She didn’t speak, and the conversation was far more subdued than yesterday. Lim and the others kept glancing at her. Geneva had just finished eating the cheese and bread dipped in soup that tasted like nothing when someone rushed at her.</p>
<p>“<em>Murderer! </em>You let them die!”</p>
<p>A fist struck Geneva on the cheek and then she was lying on the ground. She felt a boot kick her in the chest before someone shouted and the attacker disappeared. Geneva sat up and saw Lim had tackled the soldier who’d hit her. Now the other man’s buddies were drawing their weapons, and the people around Geneva were getting to their feet with theirs.</p>
<p>“<em>Put down your weapons!</em>”</p>
<p>Thriss thundered into the fray before anyone could move, face red. He roared at everyone present and threw Lim off the other soldier while he raised his mace. More officers and soldiers joined Thriss, keeping the angry soldiers apart.</p>
<p>“I’ll smash the head of anyone that draws blood, my oath on it! We’re a battalion—we fight together!”</p>
<p>“Not her!”</p>
<p>Geneva looked around as Clara helped her up. The man who’d struck her was shouting, barely restrained by his fellows. She recognized him. He was the friend of the dead man, the one who he’d insisted was alive. She’d already forgotten the dead man’s name.</p>
<p>“She let them die! She’s no [Doctor]! She’s not even a [Healer]! She just kills anyone she touches! She slices them up and lets them bleed to death!”</p>
<p>The other soldiers stared at Geneva. She couldn’t look anyone in the eye. Thriss’ face turned even more red, and he roared to cut the other man off.</p>
<p>“Enough! You! You’re going in with the first wave. And you—”</p>
<p>Thriss pointed at Geneva. His tone was much softer.</p>
<p>“Get to your tent. The fightin’ is going to heat up soon, and we’ll need your skills.”</p>
<p>He guided her away as the soldiers broke up and another officer took over the shouting. Geneva staggered away as Clara gave her a brief pat on the back. Thriss marched towards her tent—they’d pitched it in another location because the bugs had infested the previous area too badly. Geneva looked up at the [Sergeant]. Her hands were shaking again.</p>
<p>“What he said—”</p>
<p>“He lost his friends. Don’t pay any attention to him.”</p>
<p>Geneva shook her head.</p>
<p>“He was right. I can’t do this. Not alone.”</p>
<p>“There’s no one with a [Healer] class in the battalion. You’ll have to.”</p>
<p>“I <em>can’t!</em>”</p>
<p>Geneva stopped in her tracks and shouted at Thriss, ignoring the people who stared.</p>
<p>“I can’t do this alone! I don’t just need another [Doctor]—I need assistants, proper ones! I need people who know how to perform surgeries and don’t throw up <em>on </em>my patients. I need surgical tools, or some healing potion for deep injuries. I <em>can’t</em> close them on my own.”</p>
<p>Thriss chewed at his lip. Then he shook his head again, reluctantly.</p>
<p>“We have none to spare. We used up a lot of what we had yesterday—and the fighting will only get worse from here. I’ll assign soldiers to you, but I can’t promise they’ll be any better.”</p>
<p>“Then everyone dies, just like that soldier said.”</p>
<p>“I—”</p>
<p>Thriss broke off. He looked at someone behind Geneva, and then she heard a low voice.</p>
<p>“[Doctor].”</p>
<p>Geneva turned. Her heart nearly burst out of her chest.</p>
<p>Someone was standing in front of her. Someone—someone dead. She was one of the soldiers Geneva had tried to save yesterday, the one who’d bled out. But she was dead. She was—</p>
<p>She was the one who Geneva had put the Selphid into.</p>
<p>The woman looked different than she had yesterday. Her skin was totally white now, and she stood awkwardly. The right half of her body sagged, and she moved awkwardly, as if she’d had a stroke. But her left side seemed perfectly able, and she smiled crookedly at Geneva.</p>
<p>Thriss had noted her skin color as well. He put his hand on his sword warily.</p>
<p>“We have no Selphids among this Batallion. Identify yourself.”</p>
<p>The Selphid saluted with one hand. She was armed with a sword, and the dead woman’s armor, the chainmail still covered in dried blood.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. My name is Okasha. I am a [Rogue], Level 23. I am part of the Burning March 6<sup>th</sup> Division. My squad was destroyed by a mage spell. I would rejoin my unit, but my right side is useless. I cannot fight, but I will help the [Doctor].”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Geneva stared at the Selphid in the woman’s body. She couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>“You were dead. I saw you. I put you in the other body, but you didn’t move even after I checked again.”</p>
<p>The Selphid smiled.</p>
<p>“I was unconscious. And it takes time for us to assume control of a new form.”</p>
<p>She hadn’t even guessed that might happen. Geneva’s stomach twisted.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Okasha raised one hand and smiled again.</p>
<p>“I should be the one thanking you. You saved me. I would have died in that body if you hadn’t closed my injuries and put me in a new one.”</p>
<p>Thriss grunted irritably.</p>
<p>“So you can doctor Selphids? Looks like you’ve got a good use, to me. Try to save more of our folk instead of them, though. And here’s your assistant, if you’ll have one of them.”</p>
<p>Geneva looked at Okasha. She bit her lip. The Selphid was clearly disabled or wounded—perhaps permanently if she couldn’t regrow whatever she was missing. But Geneva needed all the help she could get.</p>
<p>“I need an assistant. But I’ll be cutting up bodies and performing surgery. Can you handle that?”</p>
<p>This time even Thriss bared his teeth in a reluctant grin. Okasha laughed.</p>
<p>“I am a Selphid. Bleeding and organs do not scare me.”</p>
<p>Oh. Of course. Thriss left the two as Geneva tried to give Okasha a crash course on the thousands of things she needed to know to be a capable assistant. Okasha listened carefully, nodding. She had a patient personality, and what was even better, she understood when Geneva talked about arteries and veins and bloodflow.</p>
<p>“I know of these things. I have seen them and felt how they move.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>The Selphid nodded. She took a breath—if she didn’t speak she took breaths very rarely, which was unsettling. She also blinked much less than normal people. She was a creature living in a dead body, but Geneva was fine with that. At least there was life in this corpse.</p>
<p>“I have lived in Dullahan and Lizardfolk bodies as well. I can show you how they live and breathe as well.”</p>
<p>Geneva suddenly realized that she was standing in front of the only person who might know more about the human body than she did. The relief made her almost lightheaded, but then she heard shouting. The soldiers were already heading into battle.</p>
<p>Her face and ribs hurt where she’d been kicked. She was still exhausted, and the dead and the accusations of the soldier still haunted her. But this time she was not alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Apply pressure! I’ll stitch!”</p>
<p>Geneva shouted at Okasha over the man’s screams. The Selphid nodded and hung on to the man’s arm. She was strong—far stronger than normal and while the other soldiers held him down she minimized his blood loss with an iron grip.</p>
<p>The man writhed and screamed, but when Geneva had cut the thread, he was alive and even healthy enough to walk back to camp. That didn’t stop him from trying to take a swing at Geneva, though.</p>
<p>Okasha blocked the strike and sent the man staggering back with a knife-hand to the throat that made him choke. Geneva checked, but his throat was intact. The soldier roughly dragged her former patient out&nbsp;as she stared at Okasha.</p>
<p>“Don’t hurt patients.”</p>
<p>“Why not? He was striking at you.”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, try not to <em>hurt</em> him. I am a doctor. I have sworn an oath not to inflict needless harm or kill.”</p>
<p>“But you are on a battlefield.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I am.”</p>
<p>Geneva rested her face in her hands. Blood smeared her face before she realized what she was doing. She looked up.</p>
<p>It was no better today. Despite Okasha’s help, she could not save those badly hurt. She was incapable. She couldn’t do blood transfusions and she wasn’t <em>quick</em> enough to finish operations before her patients bled out.</p>
<p>But she would save them. Each time one came in, Geneva felt herself go insane. She would save them. She would. She wasn’t walking with death anymore. She was wrestling with it.</p>
<p>But she was still losing.</p>
<p>“I can’t do this.”</p>
<p>They were the same words as yesterday. But the Geneva who uttered them was different. She wasn’t desperate and tired any longer; now Okasha was here, she was remembering. It was all so clear now. She had been a fool, trying to adapt modern practices with barbaric tools. She had to go back to another time. Think. She knew some accounts of doctors from World War II. What could she—</p>
<p>The soldiers carrying in the next groaning soldiers were surprised when Geneva thrust her way out of the tent with Okasha behind her. The [Doctor]’s face was grim, but determined. She shook her head at the soldiers.</p>
<p>“Put him down. I’m going to triage first.”</p>
<p>She should have done it at the very start. But she’d started on that first patient without even thinking. She was a fool.</p>
<p>Now, though—</p>
<p>“Get me some charcoal and cloth.”</p>
<p>She snapped at a soldier as she began to walk the lines of the wounded. There were even more than yesterday. They looked up as she passed, but Geneva didn’t meet their eyes. If she did, she would lose heart. Instead, she looked at their injuries.</p>
<p>“White armbands are for priority patients. Use the charcoal and add a marking if they’re lower priority.”</p>
<p>That was what she informed Okasha as she began to sort the soldiers. She prioritized injuries she could treat that were time-sensitive. Severed arteries, excessive bleeding—</p>
<p>But those with injuries she couldn’t mend she left alone. And those who had superficial cuts she added a black line on the cloth she tied to their arms or legs. They didn’t understand at first, the soldiers. They stared at her with suspicion, but they began to understand as she brought in the patients she’d marked as priority.</p>
<p>“They are beginning to try to alter their armbands, those who are awake.”</p>
<p>Okasha remarked lightly as she handed Geneva the one of the sharpened daggers. Geneva grunted and Okasha deftly caught the sweat before it could sting her eyes. The Selphid was competent and deft despite only having one arm, but she had a distinct lack of sympathy for the man who was groaning on the table as Geneva tried to cut a chunk of metal out of his thigh.</p>
<p>“They are trying to erase the black markings. But we shall see if their bands are wet or smudged.”</p>
<p>“Suture.”</p>
<p>The needle was in her hands a second after Geneva said it. The [Doctor] began to stitch rapidly. She could still hear the screams, and what was worse, now she could hear people shouting in anger.</p>
<p>They came for her when she was taking a five minute break. Oksaha insisted on it, and Geneva gulped down water and tore into some bread feverishly.</p>
<p>“You!”</p>
<p>A Lizardwoman shouted at Geneva as she advanced on her angrily. The soldiers Thriss had posted with Geneva moved to block her, but the Lizardwoman wasn’t alone. Clara was with her. The other soldier had a dark look on her face.</p>
<p>“Clara? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Geneva looked at the woman. Clara pointed.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you treating Lim!?”</p>
<p>She hadn’t even seen the boy. But he was lying on the ground next to her tent, face pale, gasping. He had a long cut down his sword hand; long, but shallow. Geneva looked back at Clara and shook her head.</p>
<p>“I can’t. He’s not in danger. I have to treat—”</p>
<p>Clara grabbed for Geneva. Okasha blocked her, but the other soldier was screaming at Geneva now. The young woman felt spit hit her face.</p>
<p>“<em>How dare you! </em>Lim is your friend! He <em>saved</em> you! He was first in line!”</p>
<p>“He isn’t badly hurt. He will wait.”</p>
<p>Geneva’s voice was steel. Her heart was a cold ball. She’d put it away to perform surgery; it was the only way she could stay sane. But now it was melting, growing hotter in her chest.</p>
<p>“You’re a <em>monster!</em>”</p>
<p>The Lizardwoman lunged at Geneva and was held back by the soldiers. She struggled in their grip; she was stronger than the other two.</p>
<p>“You’re letting Namass <em>die!</em> I saw you—you didn’t even put a band on his arm!”</p>
<p>Geneva remembered the Lizardman. He had been stabbed straight through the gut, but someone had carved upwards and sliced through his organs. There wasn’t anything she could do—nothing that wouldn’t take too long.</p>
<p>She met the Lizardwoman’s eyes.</p>
<p>“I am triaging. I have to prioritize people I can save.”</p>
<p>“That’s evil!”</p>
<p>Clara shouted it at Geneva as Okasha fought to keep her back. Geneva felt her heart grow more painful. The female soldier shouted at Geneva.</p>
<p>“Don’t you care about your friends!? Why aren’t you helping Lim? He’s one of us. He was first. He—”</p>
<p>It was all too much. Geneva heard ringing; saw red. She was grabbing Clara before she knew it, screaming at her at the top of her lungs. The screaming soldiers, the shouting soldiers and those resting in camp—even the insects seemed to fall silent as Geneva gave vent to the fury in her.</p>
<p>“Good? Evil? A <em>doctor </em>isn’t any of those things!”</p>
<p>Geneva shouted the words into a pair of scared blue eyes. She shook the other woman hard, grabbing at her with hands still crusted with blood. She pointed at the rows of wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>“I will save everyone I can. I will save <em>the most people I can. </em>That is how this works! This isn’t morality! This isn’t choice! This is <em>medicine!</em> Now get out of the damn way or help me! I have a job to do.”</p>
<p>She threw Clara aside and stormed towards her tent. Okasha was right behind her. Geneva raised the needle and thread and got to work.</p>
<p>Stitch. Suture. Stop the blood flow here. Bandage. Okasha had learned to tie them properly. Clean the vomit away. Bugs crawling on the feces. Too many. Change locations.</p>
<p>Incision here. Repair this. Cauterize. Amputate. Ignore the screams.</p>
<p>She didn’t even remember falling asleep. She just looked around for the next patient, and there were none. Geneva didn’t remember closing her eyes. She only knew that she fell back and Okasha caught her before she hit the ground.</p>
<p>That night Geneva leveled up again. She gained <em>six</em> levels and four different skills. Okasha told her it was practically unheard of, but Geneva had never heard of a modern-day doctor who’d gone through what she had.</p>
<p>Over a hundred and thirty soldiers had passed under her needle and blade yesterday. Of that number, she had saved over two thirds. Twice that number had died over the course of the day. Some had been from her battalion, but Geneva later learned that every group fighting was experiencing potion shortages. They’d sent their wounded to her, sometimes over the course of many miles.</p>
<p>Geneva had learned four skills. Two were merely useful; [Numbing Touch] made people feel less pain and [Flawless Cut] allowed Geneva to make incisions far more easily than before. They were tools to make her better at her job.</p>
<p>But the Skills that changed everything were the combination of [Speed Stitching] and [Enhanced Thread]. With them, Geneva could begin to truly save lives. And she did. The next day, she ate with Okasha by herself and walked towards the tent. This time she reorganized her triage system.</p>
<p>She could suture at a pace three times as fast as before, and with the thread, she could close up even damaged organs. They might still fail, but Geneva was quick enough to stop the blood loss so her patients had a chance. That night she gained only one skill – [Lesser Stamina]. It allowed her to keep going even when night fell.</p>
<p>In the days that followed Geneva gained more skills. She moved faster; began seeing exactly what treatment methods worked best. Okasha found better forceps, and somehow, a few of the soldiers assigned to Geneva learned to bind wounds as well. She rotated them across the lines of wounded, binding injuries and even stitching up wounds while she worked on the most injured.</p>
<p>Sometimes she forgot to eat while she was working, and only a hot meal shoved in front of her face would distract her. Geneva knew she was losing weight, but even when she was sleeping, a scream or cry for her name would rouse her. She couldn’t sleep. The faces haunted her. Maybe if there were others it would be different, but she was alone. She couldn’t let them die. Any of them.</p>
<p>The soldiers began to level up as [Field Medics] or [Assistants]. Geneva saved more lives. She watched more slip away. But she clung to each thread until it snapped. Death still walked by her side, but slowly, Geneva began to pull ahead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“More wounded!”</p>
<p>Geneva heard the words and looked up. She was taking a break with Okasha and a few wounded soldiers. There hadn’t been any more seriously wounded for a stretch. Now more were coming in, but the soldiers she’d trained were already triaging for her. And she needed a break; she had been working nonstop for three hours and she had to rest or she would make mistakes. Okasha had told her that and because she was right, Geneva had agreed to rest now and then. So Geneva sat and listened to Okasha.</p>
<p>“The Centaur tribe has hit every camp. They launch night raids, sneak attacks…sometimes they strike even if it means taking hundreds of casualties. Just to destroy our potions stock.”</p>
<p>A Dullahan whose head Geneva had stitched up grunted. He cradled his head carefully in his hands as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Bastards. They’ve got no honor.”</p>
<p>Another Lizardfolk nodded. Non-humans were the ones most willing to talk with Geneva right now. Clara, Lim, Fortum and the others had given her the cold shoulder, and a lot of the Humans thought she was betraying their kind by working on other species first. The Lizardman spat as the severed stump of his tail twitched.</p>
<p>“If we make it out of this mess, you’ll bet there will be hell to pay. Even if the Magehammer Company didn’t participate in the strikes themselves, they’ll be in trouble for letting the Centaur tribe get away with it. No mercenary will work with them.”</p>
<p>“But we are pushing them back. They are outnumbered, and if their mages fall, they will lose their edge.”</p>
<p>Okasha grinned as she said that, but Geneva could only imagine the slaughter. The Selphid stared at the lines of wounded and grinned. The soldiers in this group weren’t as badly injured; they had superficial wounds mostly, but Geneva saw one stump she knew she would have to tend to herself.</p>
<p>Two soldiers dumped a body on the ground. Geneva saw a Centaur, half-man, half-horse, bleeding deeply from an injury in the side. Someone had thrown a spear and it had broken off inside of him. He would die soon if she didn’t move.</p>
<p>She stood up. Okasha stood too, and Geneva strode towards the Centaur. They had him in the operating tent first. It was a difficult procedure, cutting the spear out and stopping his bleeding. But they managed it. The worst moment was when the Centaur woke up and realized he was being worked on. He screamed and thrashed and it took eight soldiers to hold him down.</p>
<p>“Easy. Easy. I’m a [Doctor]. I’m going to help you.”</p>
<p>Geneva said the words very slowly to the Centaur, looking into his eyes. His chest heaved; he tried to break free, but slowly he relaxed.</p>
<p>“I won’t hurt you, I swear it.”</p>
<p>He nodded at her, but didn’t relax. He flinched while she extracted the spearhead and only hissed as she sewed his skin together. When it was done Geneva had to help carry him out; he was extraordinarily heavy.</p>
<p>But as they were bringing him to an area that had been cleared for the wounded to lie in, Geneva heard a shout.</p>
<p>“Enemy soldier!”</p>
<p>The people around her raised their weapons. Geneva saw Thriss thrusting people aside. He pointed a finger at the Centaur, and Geneva felt her patient stiffen behind her.</p>
<p>“That’s not one of ours! That’s an enemy!”</p>
<p>He had his mace in his hands. The Centaur raised a hand weakly, but Geneva stood in Thriss’s way. He glared at her.</p>
<p>“Move aside.”</p>
<p>“No. He’s going to die. I am going to treat him.”</p>
<p>Thriss’ jaw clenched.</p>
<p>“He’s an <em>enemy</em>. We interrogate him, and we’ll find out what his lot are up to.”</p>
<p>Geneva didn’t move. Thriss tried to shove her aside, but she stepped in his way. She spread her arms.</p>
<p>“I have sworn an oath. If you want him, you have to knock me out. And if you do hurt him, I will not be able to heal any more soldiers.”</p>
<p>She raised her voice so everyone could hear her. Thriss paused as other soldiers looked her way. He gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>“You’re bluffing.”</p>
<p>Geneva met his furious gaze calmly. She spoke as loudly and as she could, knowing every eye was on her.</p>
<p>“If my oath is broken, I will no longer be a [Doctor].”</p>
<p>She felt it was true. And Thriss didn’t have the courage to test her, she knew. Every soldier knew they were out of healing potions; if they were hurt, Geneva was the only one who could fix them up.</p>
<p>Thriss advanced on Geneva.</p>
<p>“He’s one of the lot who smashed our potions! He’s been shooting at us throughout the battle! Him and all his damn tribe!”</p>
<p>“Then let him go. He can walk—barely.”</p>
<p>Geneva knew the Centaur might not survive the night in the camp, no matter what she said. She stared at Thriss.</p>
<p>“Let him go. I am a [Doctor]. This is my patient.”</p>
<p>Thriss pointed a finger that shook at Geneva.</p>
<p>“I could have you executed for aiding the enemy.”</p>
<p><em>I will not use my medical knowledge to violate human rights and civil liberties, even under threat.</em></p>
<p>Geneva gritted her teeth. She stood in front of Thriss and stared the big man down.</p>
<p>“Do it if you must.”</p>
<p>“You swore to obey orders!”</p>
<p>“I answer to a higher oath.”</p>
<p>The [Doctor] and [Sergeant] stared at each other in the center of the camp full of wounded and healing soldiers. He was the first to look away.</p>
<p>“Damn you. Get him out of here!”</p>
<p>The Centaur slowly got to his feet with Okasha’s help. He stumbled, and Geneva insisted on making him a rough crutch before he left. He looked back twice at her. She watched him go. Then she went back and continued to operate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day, Geneva set up her tent further away from the 4<sup>th</sup> Battalion’s headquarters. And she put up a flag. It had a cross on it, red, painted with the only substance Geneva could use. She hung the flag high in the air on a piece of white cloth. Okasha asked what it meant.</p>
<p>“Healing. Safety.”</p>
<p>“Then why is it red? And why a cross?”</p>
<p>Geneva had no answer for that. But it was a symbol nevertheless. She hung it over her tent, and more than once she found soldiers waving flags with crosses of their own as they brought their friends to the tent. She never asked what side they were on. She just tried to save lives.</p>
<p>Each time someone died, it was like a bit of Geneva went with them. But when she pulled someone back, when they thanked her, a bit of her came back to life as well. She ate and slept and did all the things her body required, but Geneva lived on the operating table. She lived to help other people live.</p>
<p>They all had names, all had families and dreams. They asked her not to let them die, but they couldn’t pray because the gods were dead. So Geneva prayed with every cut of her improvised scalpels, and every stitch of her needle. She prayed that she would save them. She prayed to the science she’d been taught, the lessons she tried to remember, and to medicine herself. She prayed that she was making a difference.</p>
<p>They’d just begun operating on a man, when Geneva heard a <em>thump</em> and felt the explosion in her bones. She stumbled outside to find the camp was under attack.</p>
<p>A woman hovered in the air, blasting people with fiery orbs that exploded, and tremors that engulfed her victims. She was coming towards the tent.</p>
<p>Geneva grabbed the flag she had planted, and stood in front of the lines of wounded. She held the flag up as the [Mage] approached. The other woman glanced left as an arrow broke against her skin, doing no damage, and pointed. A fiery inferno engulfed the archer who’d fired. Then she saw Geneva.</p>
<p>The [Doctor] stood coughing as the smoke from the fires reached her. Her eyes watered, but she held the flag in front of her. It was a poor shield, made of cloth and blood, but it was all she had.</p>
<p>The woman paused when she saw the flag. Her eyes flicked to the red cross, and then the wounded soldiers who were trying to crawl away or lying comatose on the ground. Then she looked at Geneva.</p>
<p>Their eyes met through the smoke and flame. The woman was smiling in the center of all the death and destruction, untouched. Geneva’s heart was pounding; her hands were still covered in the blood of the people she’d tried to save.</p>
<p>Slowly, the [Mage] turned away. She walked into the air, and away from the tent. Geneva collapsed onto the ground. Then she pushed herself back up and ran into the camp. That night she worked late, tending to burn victims and trying to make skin grafts. Many died. But she saved a few.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last day of the war in the jungle came when Okasha sat next to Geneva at breakfast. The Selphid still hadn’t regained use of her right side, and Geneva didn’t think she ever would. But the creature was smiling with her body’s lips.</p>
<p>“Do you know, the soldiers of both sides know who you are?”</p>
<p>Geneva blinked.</p>
<p>“They do?”</p>
<p>Okasha nodded.</p>
<p>“They call you the Last Light. You shine to them, the dying. Yours is the last face they see, and you drag so many back from the other side. They open their eyes and see you standing in the light.”</p>
<p>“That’s silly.”</p>
<p>“They call you that. And you have saved countless lives. I think that once we are done here, I will join you. Perhaps I can be a [Doctor] too, or at least an [Assistant], even if I only have one arm.”</p>
<p>Geneva stared at Okasha.</p>
<p>“There’s still fighting going on. This is no time to think about the future.”</p>
<p>The Selphid shook her head.</p>
<p>“The Magehammer Company has taken heavy losses. Three battalions managed to flank one of their divisions and we broke through and got their lead [Strategist]. Without him, they’ll have to pull back.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Someone was cheering in the camp. Geneva looked around. Okasha looked pleased with herself.</p>
<p>“I overheard one of the officers talking. The news is spreading even as we speak. The battle is nearly won.”</p>
<p>Soldiers were beginning to celebrate, laughing. Geneva stared at them and just felt empty. She looked at Okasha. The Selphid smiled.</p>
<p>“Perhaps afterwards you can heal those not on a battlefield. There are many people too poor for healing potions or who are hurt in ways they cannot be healed. Maybe—”</p>
<p>“<em>Attack! We’re under attack!</em>”</p>
<p>Geneva heard the galloping before she could move. Arrows flew, and suddenly Okasha was falling. An arrow had caught her in the throat.</p>
<p>“Okasha!”</p>
<p>Another arrow flew past Geneva as she caught Okasha. The Selphid wasn’t speaking, wasn’t moving. Was she dead?</p>
<p>Geneva looked up. Centaurs were running through the camp, shooting wildly. Soldiers fell around them as the Centaurs ran past her. It was another surprise attack on their camp.</p>
<p>One of the Centaurs saw Geneva was still alive. He raised a bow, and hesitated. He stopped and stared at her.</p>
<p>Geneva saw an ugly scar on his side, and looked at a bare-chested young man. He slowly lowered his bow as she looked at him.</p>
<p>Then, he shouted something at the other Centaurs. They paused, and he shouted again, pointing. They whirled, and began to gallop out of the camp.</p>
<p>The Centaur remained behind. He stared at Geneva. Slowly, he walked towards her. He stared down at Okasha, and Geneva stared up. He opened his mouth to speak—</p>
<p>“<em>Die!</em>”</p>
<p>The Centaur’s head caved in as a mace struck it from the side. Geneva screamed and Thriss pulled his mace back and struck the Centaur again. The young man fell to the ground silently, and the sergeant turned to Geneva.</p>
<p>“You.”</p>
<p>She opened her mouth but he struck her with one hand. She fell face-first to the ground and then heard him roar.</p>
<p>“Traitor!”</p>
<p>She tried to stand up, but she couldn’t. Something hit her back, so hard the world flashed white. Thriss had struck her with the mace, so hard she felt her spine <em>cracking.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Traitor!</em>”</p>
<p>He raised the mace and brought it down on Geneva’s back again. She screamed and felt something breaking. She tried to move, but suddenly she couldn’t.</p>
<p>Thriss spat on Geneva from above. He raised his mace and gasped as a blade burst through his chest. Okasha <em>twisted</em>, and Thriss choked as he fell forwards. The mace fell from his hands and splashed on the muddy ground.</p>
<p>Okasha pulled the arrow from her throat, ignoring the damage it did as it pulled out of her dead skin. Geneva stared up at her.</p>
<p>“I’m dying. My spine is broken.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t move. The Selphid stared down at Geneva and said something. Geneva grinned. She couldn’t hear anymore, either. No one was screaming. She was the only person in need of medical attention right now, but that was fine. There was no one for her, and she didn’t need help anyways. It was growing very dark.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes. Geneva felt everything fade.</p>
<p>She died.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then she woke up again. Geneva’s eyes snapped open and she sat up. She sat up?</p>
<p>She stared around. She was lying on the ground. Water was falling on her face. She looked up. Rain was falling between the cracks of the jungle canopy. It was mixing with Thriss’s blood, pelting the corpse of the Centaur.</p>
<p>Slowly, Geneva raised her left hand. She flexed it slowly, and tried to raise her right arm. It wouldn’t move. Geneva stared at it.</p>
<p>“I could not repair everything.”</p>
<p>A voice whispered in her ears. No—<em>inside</em> her ears. Geneva paused. The voice was familiar.</p>
<p>“Okasha?”</p>
<p>Something was wrong. Something was very wrong. Geneva felt something…<em>twisting</em> inside of her. Something was <em>in</em> her.</p>
<p>“I am here now. I had to bridge the gap to make you move. You will not bleed to death, but you require healing.”</p>
<p>Geneva wanted to throw up. Her stomach heaved, but something was in her as well. It held back the reflex.</p>
<p>“You had to live. There was no other way.”</p>
<p>It must have only been a few minutes. Geneva stared around the camp. It was in ruins, but she could hear the screaming. Men and women and people of other species were still alive. Some had been hit by arrows; others had been trampled.</p>
<p>And that’s when Geneva heard the rumbling, and more shouts. She looked over and saw covered carts rolling slowly through the jungle. Teams of soldiers in bright, untarnished armor marched around the wagons, pointing and shouting as they saw the devastation in the camp.</p>
<p>Geneva began to laugh. She heard a sound in her head.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“The supply wagons have finally arrived.”</p>
<p>Soldiers were swinging themselves out of the wagons, and those on the ground were rushing towards the fallen. Geneva willed her legs to stand, and they did. But she could feel something else had helped them move.</p>
<p>“I am sorry. This is forbidden, but it was all I could do. But there is no reversing it. I can—”</p>
<p>She could hear them screaming again. Geneva shook her head.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>“<em>What?</em>”</p>
<p>She willed her feet to walk. They moved reluctantly, but they did move. Geneva stumbled towards the wagon. The soldiers stared at her in shock, but Geneva grabbed as many potions as she could carry.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>She strode into the battlefield, leaving Thriss and the dead Centaur behind. The air was hot. Insects crawled over the living and the dead, and screams split the air. Geneva ran with a potion in hand, trying to ignore the agony of her own body, the howling in her mind. People called out her name and she ran towards them, healing their wounds. But it was never enough. Geneva could hear the screaming in her head. One more. She turned over bodies, staring at arrows, feeling for a pulse.</p>
<p>One more. There had to be one more. A voice was speaking to her, and someone was trying to make her rest. Geneva ignored it. One more. She had to find—</p>
<p>One more. But every face she turned over was blank and staring. Geneva ran on. She was so tired. She had to sleep.</p>
<p>Slowly, the [Doctor] fell to her knees. Mud and blood ran together as she fell into it. Geneva stared ahead, searching for bodies, but now she could no longer move. Slowly, her eyes closed.</p>
<p>The young woman lay still on the ground. Soldiers ran around her, tending to the wounded. Geneva slept. For once, she couldn’t hear the screams.</p>
<p>It was pleasant.</p>
<p>Quiet.</p>
<p>She slept, as the Selphid in her body made her walk to a safe place and lie down. In the jungle, the Magehammer Company retreated and ceded the rights to the mine to the Burning March company. The Ravarian Fighters reformed their shattered battalions and there was peace.</p>
<p>In one small place. But Baleros bled, and the jungles ran with blood which fed the insects. There was always war. War, and more war. But word spread from soldier to soldier as mercenaries travelled and rumors flew like birds. They spoke of a red cross, and a class that saved lives rather than took them. They told legends that the soldiers clung to in hope as they marched to war or lay dying. The soldiers spoke of a woman who could save lives, of a place that took no sides. They told stories about her. A healer, a savior.</p>
<p>A [Doctor].</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Pawn knew he had to return to the Hive after leaving the inn. He knew that. But he found the food Lyonette had given him was disagreeing with his stomach a bit. It must have been the eggs. Antinium didn’t usually experience food poisoning, but that didn’t meant they couldn’t get sick.</p>
<p>Therefore, Pawn decided that before he went back into the Hive and talked to Revalantor Klbkch, he should walk around the city for a while. So his steps slowed, and Pawn took the time to walk down side streets, peek down alleyways he’d never entered before, and admire the sights. He was just doing it for his stomach, but really, it was very important to look around. There were so many things Pawn would miss if he hurried!</p>
<p>For instance, had he ever really appreciated the wonders of the hamburger flipping Drake who stood on the side of the street, calling out to potential customers? The craze over the new food had swept through the city and burned itself out—now people were just as likely to go to the other hot food stands at this time of night. And yet, there was something graceful about the way the yellow-scaled Drake flipped the sizzling patties of meat.</p>
<p>Pawn inhaled the scent, along with the crisp fresh winter air. Yes, the above world was not as familiar as the Hive, but there was beauty in it he had never seen below. Why did no one ever appreciate it? Why hadn’t he? But it occurred to him that when he had been a nameless Worker, not once had he ever really stopped to stare up at the stars.</p>
<p>The Antinium looked up. The sky was dark and black—it was cloudy.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>After a moment, Pawn walked on. He took side alleys, detours—he had no fear of being mugged, and indeed the one skulking shape he encountered in a rougher part of the city retreated when it saw Pawn comings its way. No robber wanted to arouse the wrath of the Antinium, and crime wasn’t very profitable in a city where the Antinium lived in any case. Something about an Antinium Soldier <em>smashing</em> through a wooden door as ten more burrowed out of the ground tended to discourage thieves and muggers.</p>
<p>Perhaps Pawn should look for crime, though. Wasn’t that a useful pursuit? He could chase after the thieves, hit them, maybe. Or just warn them verbally?</p>
<p>Pawn sighed. He knew what he was doing. He was procrastinating, avoiding doing what he needed to do. It was the first time he’d ever done it, really. It wasn’t the most comfortable of feelings; he knew he had to act, yet he was caught in indecisiveness, holding himself back. No, it wasn’t comfortable at all. But he still hesitated. He did not want to talk to Revalantor Klbkch.</p>
<p>Because he was afraid.</p>
<p>When had he ever been afraid? Not really…ever. Only once, perhaps. Pawn could remember being afraid when Ksmvr came for him and questioned him. Then he had been terrified. And he had been afraid when he’d heard the undead were attacking Liscor and he’d feared for Erin’s life.</p>
<p>Twice, then. But beyond that? What about when he’d been a simple Worker?</p>
<p>No. Never. Pawn hadn’t been afraid. He hadn’t been much of anything, really. He’d just been, the same way as a tool was. But now he felt, and what he felt was fear.</p>
<p>He did not like Klbkch. Pawn knew that the former Prognugator was considered well-liked even by the usually hostile residents of the city. He had friends among the Watch, and he was a familiar face, even if all the Antinium looked the same. Pawn had seen the Prognugator—every member of the Hive had at some point. The Prognugator was old, far older than anyone but the Queen, he commanded them in battle and oversaw them as they worked. He slew Aberrations, too. He was known. And one thing Pawn knew about him was that Klbkch didn’t seem to like any of the Workers or Soldiers.</p>
<p>The Queen did. They were her creations, her children, after all. Pawn had stood before her once, and though she had questioned him and the words had shattered his spirit, he had known that she cared for him in her own way. She would not hesitate to use him for the Hive, but he was part of her Hive, and thus she cared for him if not as one individual, then as a part of herself. That was reassuring, and all he had expected of her. But Klbkch?</p>
<p>No. He had friends. Relc, the angry Drake. And Pawn knew he liked Erin. But <em>everyone</em> liked Erin. Pawn liked Erin, but he could not bring himself to like either Ksmvr or Klbkch. And he was fairly certain that the Revalantor had the same opinion of him.</p>
<p>It wasn’t anything the two had ever said. And Klbkch hadn’t ever done anything to Pawn. He hadn’t ripped off Pawn’s antennas and cut off his fingers and parts of his arm while questioning him for instance. But Pawn still didn’t like him.</p>
<p>And he was afraid of what Klbkch would say. Ksmvr had been ruthless, but he had been new to his role, and inexperienced. It had given Pawn the courage to stand up to him, later. But Klbkch was ancient. If the Antinium had legends, he would have been one. But they had no stories, no individuals to name and speak of. There was only the Queen, and Klbkch, the Prognugator.</p>
<p>That was how it had always been.</p>
<p>Pawn stopped in the snowy street in front of the entrance to the Hive. He stared down at the dark entrance into the ground. The dark didn’t scare him, nor did the underground. But the hole still looked ominous. Pawn took a deep breath, and then another one. And another one.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to do this. But he had to. If only Erin had been there—but there had only been Lyonette. Erin would have helped him. She would have said something reassuring that would have made Pawn not afraid.</p>
<p>Like what? Pawn thought about this.</p>
<p>“Ah. ‘You can do it, Pawn! If Klbkch gives you any trouble, kick him in the nuts! Do Antinium even have nuts?’”</p>
<p>A passing Drake [Guardswoman] walking down the street gave Pawn a look of&nbsp;deep suspicion. He dropped the falsetto and nodded to her politely. After a moment she hurried on her way.</p>
<p>“I am not sure if Klbkch eats nuts. I believe they may contain gluten. I will inquire, however.”</p>
<p>“You do that. Good luck, Pawn!”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>That made Pawn feel a bit better, although he still didn’t understand the nuts reference. He took another breath, and then marched into the Hive. He could do this. He was Pawn. If he reached the end of the chess board he could become a Queen! Or a bishop. Or knight. Queen was the optimal piece to play, but under certain situations it might be better to choose knight.</p>
<p>From street level in Liscor, descending into the Antinium Hive looked ridiculously easy. There were no noticeable guards, and the dirt was sloped for easy entry. But that was an illusion.</p>
<p>About ten steps into the darkness below, Pawn glanced left and right. The silent Soldiers standing in their alcoves in the wall watched him pass without moving a muscle. On the other hand, if he’d been anyone but an Antinium, they would have immediately apprehended him, and his survival would have been contingent on how much of a fight he put up. The Antinium had made many concessions to live in Liscor, but they did not suffer intrusion lightly.</p>
<p>As always, the Soldiers looked identical as they stood at the ready, even to Pawn. He could identify some other workers by the scratches on their chitin, or their jobs, but the Soldiers were one alien mass to Pawn. Workers did not talk to Soldiers, and Soldiers did not work with Workers unless there was some construction that needed their cooperation. Or if they trampled a Worker by accident.</p>
<p>But today Pawn was feeling reckless. He stopped and looked at one of the Soldiers. The Antinium was head and shoulders taller than Pawn and far broader, too. Pawn looked at his stub-like fingers, designed to pierce an enemy’s skin and let the Soldier bash his opponent into submission. But they were Antinium, weren’t they?</p>
<p>“Ah, good evening.”</p>
<p>The Soldier stared at Pawn. Pawn stared back uncomfortably. What was he doing?</p>
<p>Exchanging pleasantries. That was it. What came next?</p>
<p>“Rather cold outside, isn’t it? I hope you are all warm?”</p>
<p>The Soldiers didn’t respond. They couldn’t—they couldn’t speak. But they made no move either. They just stared at him. But all of them were staring, now.</p>
<p>After a second, Pawn continued walking. He felt the gaze of the Soldiers on his back as he left, though. And his mind was in turmoil. Pawn entered the flow of other Workers and groups of Soldiers and descended into the hive, wondering. Why had he done that? It was stupid. Had he expected a response? No, of course not. Then why had he done that?</p>
<p>Maybe because it was something Erin would do. Something she’d done. She’d asked a Worker his name, and treated him as if he weren’t just one of many.</p>
<p>Pawn sighed, and the Workers around him stiffened for a second as he walked through the shifting mass in the tunnels. That was stupid. He wasn’t Erin. And Soldiers couldn’t be Individual. He’d tested them with Klbkch. They took longer to respond to being questioned. And they didn’t react to being asked who they were and what their names were in the same way. But when they did—</p>
<p>The Worker shuddered as he remembered Klbkch whirling, cutting, limbs and green gore flying everywhere. No. Soldiers could not be Individual. It didn’t work for them. It barely worked for Workers without Erin.</p>
<p>As Pawn walked through the endless traffic of the Hive, the Workers around him slowly began to peel off, taking other corridors elsewhere in the Hive. In the end, Pawn reached his destination—a small room at the end of a dirt corridor—alone. He stared into the room and saw a seated Antinium, a being with two arms and slim frame instead of the normal four arms and bulkier body.</p>
<p>Klbkch.</p>
<p>Pawn wasn’t ready to talk yet. He wasn’t ready—but it was too late. There were no doors in the Hive except where it was crucial to maintain an airtight environment. Klbkch looked up as he noticed Pawn standing in the hallway.</p>
<p>“Enter.”</p>
<p>Immediately, Pawn’s legs obeyed the order. The Worker mechanically entered the room and stood before Klbkch. The Revalantor and Prognugator of Liscor’s Hive looked up at Pawn from the small wooden desk he sat at, expressionless. The two swords of his station hung at his side; the Antinium did not take them off even in the Hive. Pawn found his eyes drawn to the blades; they were the same ones that had sliced off his limbs.</p>
<p>“Pawn. Is there something you need to bring to my attention?”</p>
<p>“Um.”</p>
<p>Pawn stared at Klbkch, feeling his heart racing frantically. His mind felt blank. He didn’t know what to say. But now Klbkch was staring at him, and he had to say <em>something. </em>What would Erin say?</p>
<p>“Yes. No? I have a lot to say. About classes. Mine, that is.”</p>
<p>“Indeed?”</p>
<p>Klbkch shifted in his seat. He looked at Pawn—coldly. Yes, it was a cold look. The Antinium didn’t have many expressions, but Pawn could tell he wasn’t happy.</p>
<p>“Have you received a different class? Or leveled up since we last spoke?”</p>
<p>The Queen had told Pawn to report any changes in his level or class to Klbkch. The Revalantor was in charge of monitoring the new Individuals. Pawn hesitated. He had to tell the truth. But he really didn’t want to. Maybe he could work up to it?</p>
<p>“Yes, I have news. But I ah, also came to ask about it. News, that is.”</p>
<p>“News? What are you referring to?”</p>
<p>“Erin.”</p>
<p>Pawn didn’t know what he was saying. Why was he asking the Revalantor for information? But he did want to know.</p>
<p>“Is she well? I went to her inn today, but the girl living there told me that Erin was missing. Lost. In a Human city?”</p>
<p>Klbkch nodded reluctantly.</p>
<p>“That is so. She is well, and Ryoka Griffin is with her. She cannot return yet due to the Goblin presence in the region, but she is safe.”</p>
<p>“I see. I…see. That is good.”</p>
<p>“It is acceptable. Now, inform me of the new class or level you have obtained.”</p>
<p>Klbkch was staring hard at Pawn.&nbsp; The Worker felt like sweating, even though the Antinium didn’t sweat. Or maybe he just felt like excreting liquids.</p>
<p>“I have…gained a new class. A while ago, in fact.”</p>
<p>“Indeed? Why did you not report this to me at once?”</p>
<p>Klbkch’s tone grew colder, if that was even possible. Pawn lowered his head.</p>
<p>“I was unsure of the nature of the class. I received it after a conversation with Erin Solstice, and I have been unable to discern the nature of either the Class or Skill I received.”</p>
<p>The Revalantor shook his head slightly.</p>
<p>“Erin. Of course. What Class did you receive after speaking with her?”</p>
<p>“[Acolyte].”</p>
<p>The Revalantor paused. Pawn could see him visibly thinking. Then the other Antinium shook his head.</p>
<p>“I am unfamiliar with the class, as well as the word.”</p>
<p>“As am I. I was hoping you could shed light upon the meaning of the class.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Klbkch did not rise from his seat, but he shifted ever so slightly.</p>
<p>“You said you obtained this class after speaking with Erin? What was the context of your discussion?”</p>
<p>“It was…”</p>
<p>Pawn hesitated. It had been just after his questioning by the Queen. He had been in turmoil, asking about the dead Workers. His friends. Erin had comforted him, given him hope. But he didn’t want to tell Klbkch that. Instead, Pawn chose the simplest answer.</p>
<p>“We talked about religion. And I believe my class pertains to Gods.”</p>
<p>Instantly, the Antinium seated in front of Pawn froze. His entire body grew still, and Pawn could sense the emotions whirling in Klbkch. But the Revalantor didn’t do anything. Instead, after a minute he looked back up at Pawn as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>“Gods?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Intriguing. Do you refer to the dead gods of ages past?”</p>
<p>“No, a new God. A living one.”</p>
<p>There it was again. Klbkch froze, only for a shorter period. Pawn watched him carefully.</p>
<p>“Revalantor Klbkch, do you know anything of Gods? I had a discussion with Erin Solstice about them, and she informed me of a being known as a God. In the past, people prayed to them. And they possess powers similar to magic. But…”</p>
<p>His voice trailed off. Klbkch was staring at Pawn, but it was as if he was looking straight through him. Suddenly, the Revalantor’s body was tensed, and his expression—</p>
<p>“Revalantor Klbkch?”</p>
<p>The other Antinium slowly shook his head.</p>
<p>“I know nothing of Gods. But you said that after you talked with Erin, you gained the [Acolyte] class?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Because I…believed in Gods. Or so it seems.”</p>
<p>Klbkch stared at Pawn. The Worker shifted uncomfortably.</p>
<p>“You do not know what this means? I received the Skill of [Prayer] for reaching the first level in my class.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>The Revalantor nodded once, twice. He paused, and then looked up at Pawn and shook his head slowly.</p>
<p>“This class is a mystery to me. I know of Gods, but only those who are dead. It would appear your class is an enigma.”</p>
<p>“So it would appear.”</p>
<p>“Yes. But I have noted its occurrence. You said you were Level 1 in the [Acolyte] class?”</p>
<p>“That is so.”</p>
<p>“Very well. You may return to your quarters.”</p>
<p>Pawn stared at Klbkch for a few more seconds, disappointed. He felt…let down. He’d expected the Revalantor to say something, or reveal something to him about the class that Pawn hadn’t known. At the very least, he’d expected Klbkch to be disapproving, but this?</p>
<p>It was almost as if Klbkch was hiding something. But whatever it was, Pawn didn’t expect Klbkch to confide in him. Reluctantly, he turned to go.</p>
<p>No answers here. What should he do next? Pawn stopped at the doorway, thinking. Only Erin could help him after all. Did Klbkch know when she would return?</p>
<p>“Revalantor Klbkch? May I ask if you know anything of when Erin will ret—”</p>
<p>Pawn turned and saw Klbkch, frozen in place with one sword raised to cut him down. The two Antinium stared at each other. If they were Human, perhaps Klbkch might have pretended it was a joke. Laughed, maybe, and tried to play it off. But the Antinium were different. Klbkch made no pretense; he lifted his sword and spoke calmly.</p>
<p>“If you are loyal to the Hive, do not move. You will be dead quickly.”</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>Pawn backed away from Klbkch. The Revalantor was advancing on him—cautiously. Both of his silvery swords were aimed at Pawn, and the Worker knew that Klbkch could cut him into pieces in a second.&nbsp; But why?</p>
<p>“Revalantor Klbkch, have I offended you in some way? If so, I—”</p>
<p>“Silence.”</p>
<p>There was quiet menace in the Revalantor’s voice. Normally such an instruction would have made Pawn shut up, but he knew he was about to die ether way. Panicked, Pawn raised his hands as he retreated from Klbkch.</p>
<p>“I have done nothing wrong. I am not an Aberration! I—”</p>
<p>Klbkch shook his head.</p>
<p>“You know of Gods. You must die.”</p>
<p>He said it as it were a simple truth. But Pawn still didn’t understand. He backed up again and felt his back hit the dirt wall.</p>
<p>“I do not understand. Revalantor Klbkch, if I have erred please allow me to correct my mistake.”</p>
<p>“The only correction can come from your death. No one may know of Gods.”</p>
<p>Klbkch walked forwards, the two deadly blades in his hand. For a second Pawn considered running, but he knew he would be dead in an instant if he did. The only reason he hadn’t died yet was—</p>
<p>Was…?</p>
<p>Klbkch was hesitating. He was staring at Pawn as if he didn’t know where to cut. Maybe because he wasn’t sure? If that was the case…Pawn’s mouth worked with desperation.</p>
<p>“You should not kill me. Knowing of Gods is not dangerous to the Hive.”</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>“Erin told me of Gods. Will you kill her, too?”</p>
<p>The other Antinium hesitated as he lifted a sword up. Pawn stared at the deadly edge as it poised to come down.</p>
<p>“Erin is different. But you—you are expendable.”</p>
<p>That was true. Pawn knew it. But still. He stared upwards at the blade, and then down at the ground. He couldn’t close his eyes, no matter how hard he wanted to. His voice was quiet, yet his pulse thundered.</p>
<p>“Please. I do not wish to die.”</p>
<p>He could see only Klbkch’s legs. Pawn kept his head bowed, trembling. Waiting. Would it hurt? Would he feel it, or would his next thoughts be when he was in—</p>
<p>Heaven.</p>
<p>Time seemed to slow for Pawn as that thought emerged. He imagined it, a place without pain or fear. A place where he was welcomed; a place to be. But then he thought of God and wondered.</p>
<p>He wanted it. But he didn’t. And as he thought of that, Pawn remembered Erin and wondered what she would do when she found out he was dead. And in that moment he didn’t think of heaven. He wanted to live, still. In the second before he died, Pawn whispered the word. His desire.</p>
<p>A prayer.</p>
<p>“Please.”</p>
<p>He felt nothing. Pawn kept his head bowed, and then sensed it. Movement. Slow—and then a noise. He heard the sound of metal on metal and dared to open his eyes. Klbkch was sheathing his swords.</p>
<p>The Revalantor of the Antinium stared down at Pawn. He looked uncertain. Old. Tired. But his voice was like cold steel as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Here is what will happen. You will not mention Gods or your class or Skills to anyone. And you will not worship or interact with this one in any way. Is that clear?”</p>
<p>Pawn could barely speak. He looked at the Revalantor, but instead of obedience, his first instinct was to question. He had to know.</p>
<p>“Why? Why are Gods not to be spoken of?”</p>
<p>Klbkch shook his head.</p>
<p>“That information is secret. You do not need to know it.”</p>
<p>“But what did I do? Why is knowing of Gods important? All know of the dead Gods—”</p>
<p>Pawn only saw a blur, and then he felt himself being <em>crushed</em> against the wall. Klbkch held him with one hand while the other one held a sheathed sword an inch away from Pawn’s eye. There was no mercy in the other Antinium’s gaze, just cold, focused anger.</p>
<p>“I will repeat myself once: you do not need to know why. You are a Worker; you <em>will</em> obey.”</p>
<p>Pawn tried to make a sound; it was only a gurgle. Klbkch held him in place until Pawn was starting to see blackness around his vision, and then he let go. Pawn gasped as Klbkch stepped back and sheathed his sword again.</p>
<p>“You are forbidden from discussing God, your class, or any similar subjects with any Workers or Individuals. Is that understood?”</p>
<p>“Perfectly.”</p>
<p>The words felt bitter as they left Pawn’s mouth, like how the food sometimes tasted if the Worker’s food had included more semi-rotten ingredients than normal. Klbkch stared at Pawn and then nodded curtly.</p>
<p>“Good. Leave. I will summon you at a later date to address this.”</p>
<p>Without another word, the Revalantor turned and strode off through the tunnels. Pawn watched him go. He had no idea what had happened, what to think. But he was alive. He was—</p>
<p>Alive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, Pawn had finally regained enough of himself to walk away from Klbkch’s quarters, in case the Antinium returned. He walked slowly through the Hive, ignoring how his pace slowed up countless Workers and Soldiers behind him. He had to think.</p>
<p>What had happened? What had he said that had upset Klbkch so? Why—why was mentioning Gods so wrong?</p>
<p>What was wrong with a God?</p>
<p>Pawn walked along, kicking at the ground. He didn’t know where he was going. He was upset and confused and—</p>
<p>Why had Klbkch acted the way he had? Why had he nearly <em>killed </em>Pawn? Over what? Over Gods?</p>
<p>No…knowing that there <em>were</em> Gods, not just dead ones. But even that made no sense. A God was a good thing. Erin had explained it. Gods helped. Gods made heaven and that meant…</p>
<p>Pawn turned and followed another Worker at random. He didn’t even care where he was going. What was Klbkch going to say to the Queen? Would she summon him? Or just have him killed? For knowing of Gods?</p>
<p>Why? It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t right. Klbkch hadn’t asked about the God, didn’t know anything—or if he did, he hadn’t explained.</p>
<p>Why would he hate Gods? Or a God? Why hate a God? That made no sense.</p>
<p>It was a God. God was God. Gods. Heaven. Gods and heaven and forgiveness and sin. How could anyone just turn their back on that? Or just ignore?</p>
<p>Pawn stopped at the entrance to a large room. He faintly detected the unmistakable aroma of the Hive’s food. Oh. Of course. It was meal time for some shift of Workers. He didn’t really want to eat, but maybe the noxious food would calm him down. He had to do something, whether it was walk or eat…</p>
<p>Automatically, Pawn walked into the large room. He got into line and then paused. The Worker in front of him was quite large. And the room was a bit bigger than normal. He stared up at the broad back in front of him. And up…and up…at the head of the Soldier…</p>
<p>Pawn froze. He stared around the room. The line in front of him wasn’t moving, and no one in the room was either. Soldiers, hundreds of them, sat or stood, all turned towards Pawn.</p>
<p>Staring at him.</p>
<p>The room was full of Soldiers. Soldiers, and a dozen Workers who were serving food to them in huge, deep containers three times as large as those given to Workers. But even they had paused in the act of ladling the soupy mush into the Soldiers’ bowls.</p>
<p>Everyone was staring at Pawn. He felt hot, then cold. And afraid and—</p>
<p>He’d gone the wrong way. He’d taken the wrong turn, because he was not supposed to be here. Oh, no. Not at all.</p>
<p>Pawn had walked into the Soldier’s mess room. Not the Workers’.</p>
<p>In the complete stillness, Pawn looked around. Everyone was still staring at him. All the Soldiers in line were looking at him and he couldn’t read their expressions. Pawn felt a cold knot of fear in his stomach.</p>
<p>He shouldn’t be here. Pawn turned to go, and then hesitated.</p>
<p>Why should he go? He didn’t belong here, true, but no one was kicking him out. And he was an Individual, wasn’t he? Couldn’t he stay here? What would happen if he did? Would Klbkch hunt him down and kill him?</p>
<p>Slowly, cautiously, Pawn stepped back into line. He stared at the Soldier in front of him, almost daring the huge Antinium to do anything. The Soldier stared back, and then slowly turned forwards. The Soldier in front of him did the same.</p>
<p>As one, the room slowly moved back into motion. The Workers continued serving food, the Soldiers filed forwards, and Pawn found himself in line, holding a huge and heavy container. He wasn’t even hungry, but he was committed now, and found himself standing in front of a Worker with a huge ladle who dumped a large amount of orange-brown stuff into his bowl. It looked like the food Workers got, but there was a lot more of it.</p>
<p>“Ah. Thank you..”</p>
<p>The Worker stared at Pawn. Pawn stared back. Then he shuffled forwards and a Soldier took his place.</p>
<p>What next? Now Pawn supposed he had to eat the horrible food, all of it. He stared around the room and noticed something else that was different about this room. All the Soldiers weren’t eating while standing like the Workers. No, instead they were sitting!</p>
<p>Each Soldier sat on a mound of dirt and balanced their food receptacles in the small hollowed-out mounds of the dirt table in front of them. Pawn stared, amazed. They had <em>benches </em>and <em>tables!</em>&nbsp; True, they were just crude mounds of dirt packed together until it was hard as stone, but still!</p>
<p>Pawn quickly realized why the Soldiers had tables; they had to. Their basins of food were too deep to really eat from without a stable surface, and the Soldiers’ clumsier appendages couldn’t balance their containers as easily.</p>
<p>Indeed, now that Pawn looked, the Soldiers ate far differently from the Workers. Instead of efficiently scooping food into their mouths they stuck their heads in the containers, or awkwardly lifted the muck up. They just didn’t have the same manual dexterity, and that meant there was a lot more mess on the ground.</p>
<p>Pawn sat at a table with two other Soldiers and looked around. There were hundreds of Soldiers in this room, all eating feverishly. He was so preoccupied with staring that he completely forgot his own food, until he saw one Soldier exiting the food line.</p>
<p>Maybe the Soldier was tired or distracted—Pawn kept thinking the other Soldiers were staring at him, but whenever he looked around he just saw them engrossed in feeding. But this Soldier failed to notice some fallen food slopped on the ground as he carefully held his own bowl of dinner. His foot trod down on the slimy patch and he slipped.</p>
<p>Pawn saw the Soldier try to regain his balance, but it was too late. The Soldier didn’t fully face-plant, but he collapsed forwards and all of his meal spilled out of the bowl in front of him. Instantly, the Soldier righted himself and scurried forwards, but the damage was done.</p>
<p>The Worker saw the Soldier desperately try to push the spilled slop back into the container, but he got as much dirt as food in as anything else. The resulting mash was…even more disgusting that it had been, but the Soldier righted his container and walked over to a table. He began to eat as if there was nothing wrong. But there was.</p>
<p>The Soldier couldn’t have been happy with the dirt-infused food. Pawn knew that. He and the Workers might differ in size, but they were still based off the same shape. He knew how appalling the food was <em>without</em> adding anything else to it.</p>
<p>And yet, the Soldier made no effort to go back into line. Nor did Pawn really expect him to; that would have been…not against the rules, but it would have been unusual. No non-Individual would have done something like that, so the Soldier would just eat his dirty food in silence.</p>
<p>That wasn’t right. Pawn stood up. He didn’t realize what he was doing at first, but as he approached the unfortunate Soldier, his own bowl in hands, he knew. The Soldier looked up and froze as Pawn came over to his table.</p>
<p>Pawn cleared his throat awkwardly. He didn’t know—he could sense the eyes of everyone in the room on him again. But he knew what he wanted to say, so he said that.</p>
<p>“Here. I don’t need mine.”</p>
<p>The Soldier stared at Pawn as the Worker thrust the bowl of food at him. He stared at the bowl, and at Pawn.</p>
<p>“Take it.”</p>
<p>Slowly, the Soldier shoved his bowl aside. He reached up, but his fingers were clumsier. Pawn carefully put the bowl in front of him. The Soldier stared at the food, and then at Pawn.</p>
<p>Then he began to eat. Cautiously, carefully. As if every bit of this new mush was ten times better than the dirty stuff&nbsp; in his bowl. Which, to be fair, it wasn’t. It was only a bit more palatable, but the Soldier ate and Pawn felt…</p>
<p>Better. Just a bit.</p>
<p>After that, Pawn just sat at the table while the Soldiers ate. He tried to focus on them, rather than think. It was almost peaceful, not having to do anything. And Pawn was so tired of—</p>
<p>The last Soldier finished eating from his bowl and stopped. Instantly, all the Soldiers stood up as one. Pawn jerked in surprise, but the Soldiers just walked towards the entrance of the meal hall. They put their bowls on a long shelf of dirt as they passed, ready to be reused as they filed out of the room.</p>
<p>Oh. Of course. They were done with their meal and leaving. Pawn stood up and followed them out, noting a new group of Soldiers were coming in. He left with the first group, and because he didn’t feel comfortable following the Soldiers any more, he began walking back to his sleeping area.</p>
<p>It was time to sleep. Pawn found his spot, looked around, and saw countless other Workers already sleeping in their dirt cubicles. He stared at his hands as he made himself comfortable in his spot.</p>
<p>This day was confusing. He’d been afraid at first, and then nearly killed when he’d spoken to Klbkch. Pawn still didn’t know why, but he was afraid to find out. Afraid—and yet, he wanted to know now. Klbkch knew something about Gods, and Pawn wanted, no, <em>needed</em> to know. He would find out.</p>
<p>And the Soldiers? Pawn thought of the Soldiers. He didn’t know what to think about that. It was just a small part of a long day. And yet he was still smiling a tiny bit as he fell asleep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day, Pawn woke up as he felt Klbkch summon him to his room. It wasn’t an actual voice in his mind—it was more like a feeling, strong as certainty. It made Pawn rise before the other Workers and walk through the tunnels to Klbkch’s quarters before he’d even eaten.</p>
<p>“I am here, Revalantor.”</p>
<p>“Come in and sit.”</p>
<p>Klbkch had placed a second seat in the room. He sat in his own chair, twin blades sheathed as he watched Pawn sit. He wasted no time on greetings or small talk—the Antinium just leaned forwards and spoke.</p>
<p>“I have consulted with the Queen on this matter. You will not be killed—immediately. But if there are any changes in your physical form or actions which may harm the Hive, you will be immediately killed. Is that clear?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Pawn stared at Klbkch, confused but determined to listen and make sense of things. Klbkch held his gaze for a few more moments and then nodded.</p>
<p>“Now. Explain this God to me.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Explain it. All of it. What Erin said about this God, word for word. I want to know its history, forces, motivations—everything.”</p>
<p>That was how Pawn found himself trying to tell Klbkch the same story Erin had told him. He tried to start with the same miracles she’d begun with, a God that created the world and made people in his image while he watched over them, but he kept on getting interrupted by Klbkch.</p>
<p>“There are no mentions of multiple Gods?”</p>
<p>“None. As I was saying, after he created the world, he rested for—”</p>
<p>“And it is a he? This God has a gender?”</p>
<p>Pawn <em>clicked</em> his mandibles together irritably. He hadn’t had breakfast, and he was hungry, even for his daily rations. Klbkch kept interrupting him before he got to the important parts, too. Who cared about gender?</p>
<p>“…That was how Erin described him, although she said that God may not have a gender.”</p>
<p>“Why say ‘he’, then?”</p>
<p>“She said ‘it’ sounds too weird.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Does it have a physical presence?”</p>
<p>“In a sense. It—he—works through chosen Humans.”</p>
<p>“I am familiar with the [Priest] class. In any other ways?”</p>
<p>“Ah…he sent his son to earth. And his son is divine as he is.”</p>
<p>“His son?”</p>
<p>Klbkch stared at Pawn so hard that the Worker felt uncomfortable. Why did Klbkch care so much about these details?</p>
<p>“Yes. God had a son. He was named Jesus of Naz—”</p>
<p>“Explain to me how a God has a son. Would that not also make him a God?”</p>
<p>“He is…part-God, or so I believe. But there is only one God in that sense, or so Erin said.”</p>
<p>She mentioned other Gods, but Pawn felt it wise not to mention that just yet. Klbkch tapped his chin with his finger.</p>
<p>“I feel there is something I have missed. I shall re-clarify. There is only one God, correct?”</p>
<p>“True.”</p>
<p>“But he has a son.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Whom he incarnated as a physical manifestation on earth.”</p>
<p>“Born of a Human. He was Human.”</p>
<p>“But he is also part God?”</p>
<p>“…I believe so.”</p>
<p>“That makes no sense.”</p>
<p>It didn’t. Or rather, it did and Pawn understood it in his own way, but he knew he couldn’t explain that to Klbkch. He tried to shift the conversation away from this issue and get to the important part.</p>
<p>“He is dead, in any case. He is now in Heaven, with God. That is what Erin told me.”</p>
<p>“I see. So in any case, there is only one God.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but in Heaven—”</p>
<p>Once again, Klbkch cut Pawn off.</p>
<p>“So, you are absolutely sure that this God is not present in the world at this moment?”</p>
<p>Pawn couldn’t really scowl, but he grew agitated and let his voice reflect that.</p>
<p>“I am <em>sure.</em>”</p>
<p>“Very well. Now, where did this son of God incarnate? Do you know the geographical location?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Yes I do. He was born in Jerusalem, a small town in the nation of Rome. This was at the time when—”</p>
<p>“Rome? Jerusalem? Where are these places located? Which continent?”</p>
<p>“These are locations and names from where Erin comes from.”</p>
<p>It was as if Klbkch was listening to something completely different than Pawn. The instant Pawn said that, he relaxed and seemed almost relieved.</p>
<p>“I see. I see.”</p>
<p>Pawn stared at him, nonplussed.</p>
<p>“As I was saying, the Human woman Mary was pregnant, and she was due to give birth—”</p>
<p>“I do not need to hear the rest of the story at this moment.”</p>
<p>It was like being slapped repeatedly. Pawn opened his mandibles, and then closed them. He was annoyed, and so he interrupted Klbkch before the Revalantor could speak.</p>
<p>“How is any of this important, Revalantor Klbkch? Why are Gods an issue that requires so much attention?”</p>
<p>Klbkch paused.</p>
<p>“That is none of your concern. It is a secret.”</p>
<p>“I would like to know it.”</p>
<p>“You will not be told. Enough. My next question—”</p>
<p>“I should know. If I do not, I may err accidentally.”</p>
<p>Pawn held Klbkch’s gaze as the other Antinium looked up and stared at him. After a second, the Revalantor seemed to come to a decision.</p>
<p>“All you need to know is that the existence of a God is tied to the Antinium’s existence on the continent of Rhir. Although the Antinium have changed since then, my original task as a Centenium relates directly to Gods in particular. It supersedes all other orders; hence, my inquiry. That is all.”</p>
<p>Pawn felt as though he should drop his jaw like he had seen Erin do now and then.</p>
<p>“Centenium? I am not familiar with that role. What are—”</p>
<p>“Enough.”</p>
<p>Klbkch stopped Pawn with one hand. He considered, clicking his mandibles together lightly as Pawn shifted impatiently in his seat. At last, Klbkch nodded.</p>
<p>“I have ascertained that this God is not similar to…it is not of immediate concern.”</p>
<p>“Meaning what?”</p>
<p>“I am not sure. But as its existence is known only to Erin and possibly Ryoka Griffin, I will withhold judgement until I am able to speak with them. You will not be executed.”</p>
<p>Pawn looked up hopefully.</p>
<p>“Then—”</p>
<p>“However, I will not permit prayer to this…God. My order still stands: you will not tell your fellow Workers about this God either.”</p>
<p>“But why?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t as if he’d been praying to the God before. But to be told not to without reason—Pawn felt himself growing annoyed again.</p>
<p>“May I ask your reasoning, Revalantor Klbkch?”</p>
<p>Klbkch tapped the hilt of his sword once, and then again.</p>
<p>“There are several questions that remain unanswered for me. If this God is a being that created Humans, where did the Antinium come from? Are we creations of this being, or…not?”</p>
<p>“God created all things.”</p>
<p>“In Erin’s world. Not this one.”</p>
<p>Pawn opened his mandibles—and closed them. He couldn’t respond to that. Klbkch nodded.</p>
<p>“Is it our God? Would it accept Antinium?”</p>
<p>“I do not know. But I could find out.”</p>
<p>If there was a God to ask. If this wasn’t just random chance that had given him the class. If God would answer back. Pawn said none of this out loud, but Klbkch shook his head.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>“I will resume questioning you tomorrow. I have duties to attend to, but I will resume asking questions about the relationship between this God and the Antinium. Until then, you are dismissed.”</p>
<p>Pawn wanted to say something. He wanted to shout at Klbkch, or shake him. But the Revalantor stood up, and all Pawn could do was obey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was this the God of the Antinium? Did it even matter? That wasn’t the <em>important</em> part!</p>
<p>Pawn fumed as he stomped down the dirt corridors. Who cared about whether God had a physical form? It was the salvation that Pawn had been stirred by, the idea that—that there was forgiveness! There was heaven, and more, someone who <em>cared.</em></p>
<p>It didn’t matter that this was a God for Humans.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Pawn bumped into two Workers in his commute. He apologized, and then held up the queue behind him for several seconds as he debated where to go. The meal time of his shift of Workers had already passed, and there wasn’t always food there. He could go above, but Pawn was in too foul a mood to do so right now. He wanted food, peace, and quiet—</p>
<p>Before Pawn knew it, he’d found himself in the Soldiers’ meal hall. He didn’t know why, but he lined up and took a bowl as Soldiers walked into the room.</p>
<p>“Give me only a third of the portion, please.”</p>
<p>The Worker stared at Pawn, but he did as instructed. Pawn took his bowl to a table with two other Soldiers, completely ignoring the silent stares he was receiving. He was too angry to care.</p>
<p>“That didn’t matter. There was more to the story.”</p>
<p>Pawn muttered to himself as he ate. The two Soldiers stared at him, but Pawn didn’t care. He munched down the foul mess of today’s mush, and felt even worse than before. Bad food, an unfair Revalantor—</p>
<p>It really wasn’t right. He was just a Worker, but Pawn knew he’d been happier once. When he’d gone to Erin’s inn, he hadn’t been threatened, and he’d been allowed to speak freely. He’d been fed good food, and she had told him true things.</p>
<p>He looked around. Soldiers sat at the tables around him, eating quietly. They were trapped too, weren’t they? Forced to eat this revolting food, not having anything to look forwards to.</p>
<p>It wasn’t fair. Pawn longed to tell Bird or Garry about what he’d experienced. He’d been afraid to, before. But now that Klbkch had ordered him not to, Pawn longed to walk into the Worker mess hall and shout the story out loud.</p>
<p>God. Heaven. It was a promise Erin had told him. Something to cling to. It would have given the other Workers hope. It would have made the deaths of the others meaningful. It had made everything better when Pawn had said it.</p>
<p>But no, he was trapped like the Soldiers. Trapped by orders and silence. Pawn miserably pushed his bowl forwards onto the table. The Soldiers looked up, and then down at their food. Soldiers. That was what separated Workers and Soldiers. At least Workers could speak. But Soldiers couldn’t speak.</p>
<p>And Pawn was a Soldier now, at least in part. He couldn’t speak about Gods to any other Workers. That was the problem. No other Workers.</p>
<p>No other Workers. Pawn sat up in his seat, suddenly electrified by a thought. Klbkch had instructed him not to talk to an Individual or another Worker. But Soldiers?</p>
<p>“Excuse me.”</p>
<p>The Soldier in front of Pawn looked up. Pawn cleared his throat awkwardly. It felt strange, talking to the massive behemoth. But he could speak to them.</p>
<p>“I notice you are eating. Would you mind if I told you a story? About God?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just a blank look Pawn received; it was utterly bewildered. The two Soldiers at the table looked at Pawn and made no move. But Pawn had begun this, and so the Worker took the plunge.</p>
<p>“It’s a true story. About God, which is—allow me to explain.”</p>
<p>He didn’t really know where to begin. He only knew that he <em>had</em> to share this message. And Pawn thought the Soldiers might understand. At the very least, neither of them tried to kill him as he started speaking.</p>
<p>“There is a being known as a God. And it—he created everything. And rules over everything. And he cares for us, you see? Because once upon a time, there was nothing. Nothing but God. And he wanted to create something, so he spoke. And then there was light…”</p>
<p>It wasn’t exactly how Erin had told him the story. But Pawn thought he should start from the beginning. The Antinium were a logical species; and besides, he felt he had to work up to Gods and virgin childbirths. He still wasn’t sure what a virgin was in any case, but it sounded important.</p>
<p>The Soldiers at the table listened as Pawn explained how the world was created according to Erin’s garbled explanation of the religion. It was confusing and made no sense, especially because none of the Antinium, including Pawn, had any idea what angels were. He simply described the Garden of Eden as being protected by a giant flaming white bird and left it at that.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the important bit. Pawn explained what he felt the most important part was after he’d gone through the creation of the world and the idea of sin.</p>
<p>“Even though Humans—and other species—are sinful, it does not matter. We are sinful because of what has happened, but this God cares for us. All of us. Whether we are born and die early or kill, regardless of what we do, there is someone who cares. For each of us. He knows us. He knows who we are and he <em>cares.</em>”</p>
<p><em>That </em>was what was important. How could he explain it more than that? Pawn didn’t care about how the world had started, or how many snakes could talk. It was that.</p>
<p>“Someone cares. Someone knows us, knows our every waking and sleeping motion. Someone out there cares, and knows our name. Even if we do not.”</p>
<p>The soldiers at the table stared at Pawn. Silently. They said not a word, but neither had they looked away. In fact, they’d stared silently at him the entire time he’d been talking, and even stopped eating. Bits of mush dropped off their hands as they rested them on the edges of the bowls.</p>
<p>Pawn looked around and jumped in surprise. Somehow, all the Soldiers had moved closer. Some were bunched together on other seats, and others were just standing. And they were all listening. To him.</p>
<p>Awkwardly, the Antinium cleared his throat. He hadn’t realized they’d all been listening. But it made him feel pleased, as well. And it made the next part more important.</p>
<p>“Yes, well, after the events of which I spoke, the Humans thrived. But what is important to mention is that sin still existed. They were all sinful, and thus at fault. But then God decided to send his son to be borne by a Human, so—”</p>
<p>The Soldier in front of Pawn moved. It was a sudden movement. One second he was sitting, the next he was on his feet. Pawn recoiled, but all the Soldiers had stood up suddenly. They looked towards the entrance of the mess hall.</p>
<p>What was happening? Were they upset? But—no, Pawn realized they must have been called, or else their eating period had elapsed.</p>
<p>“Oh. You have duties. I will let you attend to them.”</p>
<p>The Soldiers didn’t nod, but Pawn got the sense they had heard him. They began filing towards the door, but they moved far slower than normal. They were visibly hesitating.</p>
<p>Did they want to hear the rest? Pawn thought quickly. He called out to the Soldiers as they reluctantly walked out.</p>
<p>“I will return later. Is that acceptable?”</p>
<p>He heard no response, but Pawn <em>saw</em> Soldiers suddenly move in lock-step once more, briskly marching towards their destination. He watched them file out of the room and smiled.</p>
<p>The next day, Pawn went back and told them more stories. He told them about a young man who died upon a cross, of a prophet who parted seas, of a people watched over by something loving and kind. The Soldiers drank in every word, but they said not a thing. But they did listen. And Pawn believed that they believed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I do not understand the purpose of this tale.”</p>
<p>Klbkch snapped at Pawn as the two of them sat in Klbkch’s room. Pawn glared back, but the Revalantor did not give him a chance to reply.</p>
<p>“What is sin? Murder? Violation of ten rules? Why are all beings sinful the instant they are born? What sin did <em>we</em> commit?”</p>
<p>“Erin did not say. But that is not important. The important thing is that God sent his son—”</p>
<p>“To be killed.”</p>
<p>“Sacrificed.”</p>
<p>“Was it blood magic? I cannot understand why one death absolves an entire species of sin.”</p>
<p>“He is meant to bear our suffering. Bear our transgressions—”</p>
<p>“Yet we still transgress.”</p>
<p>“But now we are forgiven. Any mistakes we make are our own—”</p>
<p>“And if we do not obey the rules of this God, we will be punished when we die. So you have said.”</p>
<p>“Or we may obey and go to Heaven.”</p>
<p>“Which no one has ever seen.”</p>
<p>“We must believe it exists.”</p>
<p>“But you cannot prove it does.”</p>
<p>Pawn glared at Klbkch. The second day had seen him arguing for hours with the Revalantor about these very topics.</p>
<p>“It is something I would like to believe in. Respectfully, it does not harm the Hive in any way.”</p>
<p>“It does matter if this God intends to enforce such restrictions on our kind. If the Antinium cannot kill, then we will all be punished by this God.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t work that way—”</p>
<p>“Regardless, I will not allow you to worship this God.”</p>
<p>“Why <em>not?</em>”</p>
<p>Pawn stood up, knocking back his chair. Klbkch spoke coldly as he looked at the Worker.</p>
<p>“If this God made Humans in his form, then he is clearly a God for them. But the Antinium never rested in this ‘Garden of Eden’. We were not in the world where his son came to life, and thus we were not saved. We are not his. This God…is not a God for the Antinium. I will give him no power, and you will not either.”</p>
<p>“Power? It is just prayer!”</p>
<p>“That is enough. I will not allow prayer or worship of a God that does not belong to the Antinium.”</p>
<p>“That is not fair!”</p>
<p>Pawn shouted at Klbkch, surprising even himself. But the Revalantor just stood up.</p>
<p>“It is necessary, and it is my order. Talk to no one, and forget about Gods.”</p>
<p>“How can I?”</p>
<p>Pawn’s voice was bitter. Klbkch studied him, and then unsheathed one of his swords. He held the silvery blade out towards Pawn for him to inspect. Pawn looked at the gleaming metal and wondered how many of his brethren the blade had cut to pieces.</p>
<p>“Believe in this. Not something that can be neither seen nor heard.”</p>
<p>The Worker shook his head and pushed aside the sword.</p>
<p>“This is just an object. What I want is something else.”</p>
<p>“What is that?”</p>
<p>Klbkch’s tone infuriated Pawn. It was uncaring. He didn’t care about Pawn; he just saw another piece to be used. No, that wasn’t it. He didn’t <em>understand</em> Pawn. Klbkch was special. He was a Prognugator, a Revalantor, a Centenium, whatever that meant. He was second to the Queen. He—</p>
<p>Was special. But Pawn was not. He could never understand.</p>
<p>“What do I want? Salvation. Can you or the Queen offer that?”</p>
<p>Pawn turned and stormed out of the room before Klbkch could respond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That night, Pawn shifted around again and again in his small cubicle, until he realized he was waking the other Workers up. He felt hot, hot with anger and frustration. Klbkch would never understand. But he knew who might.</p>
<p>Leaving his cubicle, Pawn slipped through the tunnels, joining the night rush of Workers and moving through the passageways until he reached one that was growing familiar to him. He entered the large mess hall and looked around.</p>
<p>They were there, all of them. Pawn had grown to know these Soldiers, identify them somehow. Maybe it was the way they looked at him familiarly, or how they crowded around now, abandoning their meals or taking the bowls with them to listen.</p>
<p>“I have told you all the stories of God that I know.”</p>
<p>Pawn addressed the hundreds of Soldiers with a loud voice. He sensed them shifting ever so slightly as he explained.</p>
<p>“I have no more tales to tell you. What I know, you know.”</p>
<p>They didn’t like that. Some of the Soldiers moved slightly, a sign of their agitation. But Pawn only smiled. He’d told them everything, yes, but he hadn’t told them the most important bit.</p>
<p>“There is one thing left, though. One promise that God made to his people, to all people.”</p>
<p>The Soldiers immediately froze in place, a sign of how eager they were to hear. Pawn held his breath, and then told them.</p>
<p>“Heaven.”</p>
<p>The word rang through the large room, carrying more than just sound with it. Pawn’s heart raced just like when he’d first heard that word and its meaning.</p>
<p>“Heaven. It is a place God made. A place to go when we die.”</p>
<p>A place to be happy. To be free. Pawn tried to explain that to the listening Soldiers. He knew they would understand.</p>
<p>“You see, when we die—the Antinium, we go into the Hive. But this Heaven—if we believe and are good, we will go there. And in that place, there is no suffering. No pain. We can be happy there.”</p>
<p>Happy. It was a word that Pawn barely understood. But he spoke of it confidently. It was something he barely understood, but he had glimpsed it, and it had captivated his soul.</p>
<p>“In Heaven, you will not have to eat these meals. You will eat good food, and not have to fight. You will be safe there, and no one will order you about. That is what God promises. That is—that is why it is important.”</p>
<p>That was the promise he dreamed of. A place where he might find his fellow Workers, the ones who had died. A reason why they had died. A place—</p>
<p>A place to rest. The Soldiers stared at Pawn. He looked at them, and saw something in their eyes. Something he’d never seen before.</p>
<p>Passion.</p>
<p>“That’s right. When we die, we will go there. If we believe. If we are good—if we do not sin—”</p>
<p>He paused as those words left his tongue. Sin. Yes, Erin had told him about that. Sin was violating the laws God had spoken. And one of them was not to kill. The Soldiers were built to kill. How could they be unsinful?</p>
<p>And yet, and yet, he could not tell the Soldiers that. They deserved a place there, and Pawn wanted to believe they would.</p>
<p>But would they? He didn’t know. Pawn wavered, and lost track of what he was saying. Shortly, he stood up and addressed the Soldiers.</p>
<p>“I…must go. I know you have duties. But I hope you will believe. And maybe—maybe we will all go to Heaven.”</p>
<p>He left them with that, and retreated to his cubicle. There Pawn sat and agonized.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that he didn’t believe in Heaven, or God. He wanted to with all his heart, and he did. But that was the problem. If he believed in God, he had to believe in Hell. That was what Erin said existed too.</p>
<p>How could Pawn accept that someone who had killed would go to Hell? Would Belgrade go to hell because he had killed? Or would believing be enough to go to Heaven? What about Bird? He’d killed more than Belgrade, and yet, he’d done it to save Erin. Did the undead not count? What did?</p>
<p>And what about the Soldiers? The Soldiers…<em>had</em> to go to Heaven. Pawn knew it. They weren’t bad. They obeyed orders to the letter. How could that be punished?</p>
<p>These were unfamiliar, uncomfortable questions. They made Pawn upset. It was as if Klbkch was whispering into his ears, making him doubt what had been so easy to accept. Before, Pawn had believed in a God, been certain that one existed, but too afraid to ask. Now he was afraid to ask, and he was also afraid—</p>
<p>Afraid that God might be wrong. Pawn wished Erin were here so he could ask her. But he didn’t know. He didn’t know.</p>
<p>And he feared the truth. Or that there was no answer for him. Pawn went to sleep dreaming of such questions and he tossed and turned restlessly. All he wanted was to go to Heaven. He could leave the rest, but he had to know that was true. There wasn’t a single Antinium who deserved to go to Hell. Not Bird, not Anand, not even Ksmvr.</p>
<p>Not even Klbkch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pawn was dreaming. Or he had been. He only knew he was asleep, and then someone was shaking him, dragging him out of his cubicle. Pawn opened his eyes, and struggled to move, but an iron grip had hold of him and someone was shouting in his ear holes.</p>
<p>“<em>What have you done?</em>”</p>
<p>Klbkch dragged Pawn out of his resting spot and shook the Worker violently. Pawn gasped and tried to form words as he woke up.</p>
<p>“What? Reva—”</p>
<p>“<em>What did you do?</em>”</p>
<p>Klbkch <em>hurled</em> Pawn into a wall and pressed him there. Pawn gasped for air as he felt something <em>crack</em>, but Klbkch was already dragging him down the corridor. Pawn struggled to find his feet as Klbkch shouted at him. He saw Workers staring at him as he passed by their cubicles.</p>
<p>“What is going on?”</p>
<p>“Follow me! <em>Move!</em>”</p>
<p>The Revalantor pulled Pawn along, running him down the corridor. The never ending stream of Workers and Soldiers stopped dead as the two Antinium charged down the corridors, and the other Antinium pushed themselves to the walls to give them room to run.</p>
<p>Pawn had no idea what was happening. But he sensed where they were going and his heart stopped when he realized they were headed straight for the Soldiers’ mess room. Klbkch stopped at the entrance and unsheathed his swords, and pushed Pawn through.</p>
<p>“What is happening? What—”</p>
<p>The Worker stumbled into the room and his words stopped. He stared around inside and saw hell. It must have been hell, because what he saw made no other sense.</p>
<p>The huge room was filled with Soldiers. Living Soldiers—and dead ones. The dead lay on the ground, beaten, bludgeoned to death, sporting huge holes in their carapace, huge, fist-sized wounds made by the hands of Soldiers. And as Pawn looked around, he saw dark shapes struggling with each other, hitting, tearing, smashing—</p>
<p>The Soldiers were <em>killing</em> each other.</p>
<p>There was no order to it, no clear indication where violence began or ended. Each Soldier still living—and there were countless bodies on the floor—was going around, hitting other Soldiers with their bowls, using all four hands to pummel each other to the floor. They were treating everything and everyone like an enemy, but they made no attempt to block when they were struck. They simply let the other Soldier tear bits of their carapace off and let the green ichor spill from their bodies.</p>
<p>“What is this?”</p>
<p>Pawn screamed the words at Klbkch as the Revalantor entered the room. Klbkch had both blades raised defensively as he looked around at the bloodbath.</p>
<p>“You tell me. These Soldiers were completely fine yesterday, but they started butchering each other ten minutes ago. Workers tell me <em>you</em> were spotted entering this room thirty minutes before they started this madness.”</p>
<p>“Me? I—yes, but I never told them to do this!”</p>
<p>He would have never done that. Klbkch just stared at him.</p>
<p>“Then <em>why</em> is this happening?”</p>
<p>Pawn had no answer. He stared at the Soldiers. One had taken a bowl and was smashing another’s head in with it. Pawn ran forwards.</p>
<p>“Stop! What are you doing?”</p>
<p>The Soldier took no notice of Pawn. Pawn tried to pull him back, but the Soldier just threw him backwards. Pawn stumbled away and stared around.</p>
<p>“They’re killing each other? Why? Why do this?”</p>
<p>“What did you say? Have they become Aberrations?”</p>
<p>Klbkch’s sword was aimed right at Pawn’s head. The Worker raised his arms.</p>
<p>“I didn’t say anything!”</p>
<p>“You said something. What were you telling them?”</p>
<p>“Just stories!”</p>
<p>“Stories? About what?”</p>
<p>“God.”</p>
<p>The sound Klbkch made was between a screech and a shout. He struck Pawn with the pommel of his sword, so hard Pawn felt his cheek chitin <em>crack</em>.</p>
<p>“You <em>fool. </em>I <em>ordered</em> you not to—”</p>
<p>“I didn’t meant to hurt them! I just wanted to give them hope!”</p>
<p>Pawn cried out as he retreated from the furious Klbkch. The Revalantor looked around at the chaos.</p>
<p>“You call this hope?”</p>
<p>“No! I never wanted this. I was just telling them about heaven, last night. Just heaven—”</p>
<p>Pawn’s breath caught in his throat. He stared around at the Soldiers dying and realized what had happened. His heart became ice in his chest.</p>
<p>“No. Heaven.”</p>
<p>Klbkch looked around grimly.</p>
<p>“Explain.”</p>
<p>“I—I told them that when they died, they could go to Heaven. A place without pain. A place—”</p>
<p>“You told them <em>that?</em>”</p>
<p>Pawn couldn’t look at Klbkch. He stared at a fallen Soldier, his body a mass of holes. No. He hadn’t meant it like that. But he had, hadn’t he? He’d told the Soldiers that when they died they wouldn’t have to fight anymore, to suffer. And they’d believed him. They’d believed him so much that they’d taken the fastest route to get to heaven:</p>
<p>Suicide.</p>
<p>“There are four hundred Soldiers here. If they all die—”</p>
<p>Pawn didn’t listen to Klbkch’s threat. He ran forwards, shouting. The Soldiers were deathly quiet as they fought each other, but the noise of body parts <em>crunching</em> and things breaking was still loud enough.</p>
<p>“Stop! Stop this! This isn’t the way!”</p>
<p>None of the Soldiers looked at him. Pawn shouted desperately and tried to pull a trio of Soldiers beating a fourth one down apart. They ignored him, only shoving him back. He used all of his strength, but they were far stronger.</p>
<p>“<em>Soldiers!</em>”</p>
<p>Klbkch’s voice was a roar. He strode forwards, brandishing his swords.</p>
<p>“Desist at once! Obey my command and <em>stop!</em>”</p>
<p>A few of the Soldiers looked over at Klbkch. He was a commanding presence, but even his twin swords couldn’t intimidate the Soldiers. They were fearless. And even as he spoke, a Soldier rushed at him.</p>
<p>Klbkch immediately ran the Soldier through, but that was what the Antinium had wanted. The Soldier pushed himself onto the blades, letting them pierce his chest. Klbkch cursed as he pulled the blades loose, but then another Soldier ran at him, swinging aimlessly. He was trying to get Klbkch to kill him too!</p>
<p>Pawn watched, horrified as Klbkch cut the Soldiers’ arm off and then beheaded him. The Revalantor fell back, cursing, as more Soldiers rushed at him, letting him cut them down.</p>
<p>“Stop! Stop! You must stop! This is not the way to get to heaven!”</p>
<p>If they did not go to heaven, then they would go to hell. That was what Erin had said. But the Soldiers weren’t listening. They were trying to find relief, relief from their suffering. Pawn understood that. But this—</p>
<p>This was a sin. One of the worst ones. They would all go to hell. They would suffer, not live forever. That was what God had said. Those were the rules.</p>
<p>He couldn’t stop them. Pawn fell to his knees. He looked up, at where Erin had pointed when she spoke of Heaven.</p>
<p>“God. Is there a God?”</p>
<p>How did it go? Pawn’s hands clasped together and he bowed his head. Klbkch saw that and roared at him.</p>
<p>“<em>Stop that!</em>”</p>
<p>He fought towards him, but now all the Soldiers were rushing him. Pawn ignored Klbkch. He bowed his head. He couldn’t close his eyes, but that was what Erin had said to do, right? And now he prayed? How?</p>
<p>Erin had said it was like a conversation. Pawn tried.</p>
<p>“God? Is that you?”</p>
<p>There was no response. Pawn tried. He tried to activate his Skill.</p>
<p>“[Prayer]. I would like to pray to God. Please. I would like to speak with you.”</p>
<p>Again, Pawn heard nothing. But maybe God didn’t speak? It could just be a feeling. Pawn went on, trying to raise his voice over the sounds of Soldiers dying and his own heart.</p>
<p>“God, I hope you are listening. I beg of you—have mercy on the Soldiers here. Do not let them go to hell. Please. I know it is a sin, but—”</p>
<p>“<em>Pawn!</em>”</p>
<p>Klbkch was shouting at him. Pawn tried to concentrate. He tried to <em>believe</em>, but he couldn’t. Green liquid was running across the dirt floor, and shards of pottery and Soldiers were strewn across the ground. It was a nightmare. His nightmare.</p>
<p>“A sin. I know it is a sin to kill yourself. But the Soldiers just want—they want forgiveness.”</p>
<p>Lies. It stuck on Pawn’s tongue. They didn’t want that.</p>
<p>“They want to be saved. They want to be free.”</p>
<p>And didn’t they deserve that? The Soldiers suffered. Pawn knew that. He’d seen some who still walked around the Hive, even though their carapace was so badly damaged that it barely hung off their frames. He’d seen them fighting even when parts of their heads had been destroyed.</p>
<p>“They give everything for the Hive. They deserve it. Even if they are—”</p>
<p>Sinful? The Soldiers? Pawn couldn’t imagine it. They killed, yes, but they obeyed orders. They never did anything…wrong. He looked up and gave voice to the question in his heart.</p>
<p>“God, please answer me. What sin did the Soldiers commit? What did they do?”</p>
<p>Nothing. They just lived. They were born for the Hive. How could something like that be sinful? How could a Soldier deserve punishment?</p>
<p>Eat. Fight. Suffer. Die. That was their life. They couldn’t speak; they couldn’t even build anything like the Workers. They just did the same thing forever and suffered as they fought until the day they died. And when they died, the next Soldier would keep fighting until he died. And so on. Forever.</p>
<p>“Please. I beg you. Show them mercy.”</p>
<p>Pawn spoke the words, but he felt no response. Nothing. It was as if there was no one listening. But that was how it worked, right? You believed. And if you believed…</p>
<p>Then what? What if there was no God? What if the Soldiers just died?</p>
<p>Pawn struggled. He had to believe. He couldn’t listen to those thoughts. But now Pawn was wavering. His belief crumbled. He had believed. But all he had was a Skill which wasn’t working and God—</p>
<p>He was a God for Humans. That was the problem. Maybe they were sinful, but Pawn couldn’t call Soldiers sinful. They had been born without any choice; to disobey was to die. How could you condemn something, someone who knew nothing else?</p>
<p>How could you call that sin?</p>
<p>And then, as Pawn thought that, he wondered how he could believe in a God if he couldn’t believe in that. And as soon as that thought hit him, Pawn wondered what he would do if that God didn’t exist. Would he obey another God? Worship someone else? Erin had said there was more than one. What about the God who threw lightning, or the one who was actually countless Gods and Goddesses? How could he choose?</p>
<p>They were all Human Gods, anyways. The Antinium didn’t need a God for Humans. They needed another one.</p>
<p>Was there a God for the Antinium? Pawn looked up and saw only dirt. He listened, but heard only the beating of his heart. And death. He heard the Soldiers hitting each other. That was what echoed in his mind. In his heart. His soul.</p>
<p>He tried to pray, but no one responded. And the Soldiers were dying. The last of them were falling, bleeding. Faltering. And if they died and Pawn was wrong, then what? They would just die, and rot, and nothing would change.</p>
<p>They should not die alone. Pawn prayed, but he heard nothing. He prayed for the Soldiers and felt no one respond. So he stood up instead, and <em>screamed.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Stop!</em> <em>STOP!</em>”</p>
<p>His voice was not aided by a Skill, but Pawn screamed the word again and again with all his might until there was silence. He saw the Soldiers stop and turn towards him. Klbkch froze with one blade in the body of a Soldier, staring at him.</p>
<p>Pawn raised his hands. He trembled. But he spoke anyways, shouting to the Workers.</p>
<p>“I was wrong. I was <em>wrong. </em>There is no god for us. No place. No one to care for the Antinium.”</p>
<p>The Soldiers froze. They stared at Pawn, not wanting to believe. He sensed their confusion, their anguish. No God?</p>
<p>“I prayed, and I heard nothing. Maybe there is a God. But if so, I can’t hear him. Or her. Or <em>it.</em> I can’t believe in something I cannot see or hear or touch.”</p>
<p>His words felt like rain. Biting, acid rain, tearing away his self. Pawn suffered, and wished he could weep. The Soldiers were just staring, blood covering their bodies.</p>
<p>“But. I believe in Heaven. I believed. I believed that there was salvation for us. Someone to remember the Antinium. But maybe heaven is only for Humans.”</p>
<p>Maybe only they had one. Pawn turned to the Soldiers, staring around the room.</p>
<p>“There is no Heaven. Not for the Antinium. But we must have one. We must. So we shall make it for ourselves.”</p>
<p>There. He’d said it. Pawn felt the stillness in the room. He took one shaky breath.</p>
<p>“I cannot believe in a God who will not answer me. I cannot believe in a God I do not see. But I can believe in Heaven. I can believe there is salvation.”</p>
<p>It was a lie. It was truth. Pawn looked around. The Soldiers stared at him, dying, bleeding. But they looked at him, to him, and he told them what was in his heart.</p>
<p>“Believe in that. Believe that no matter what happens, you will be saved. There is a place where the dead Antinium go where we will have no orders, where we will be safe and feel no pain, no hunger.”</p>
<p>He spread his hands, imploring. Beseeching them to understand.</p>
<p>“But believe this: you cannot kill yourself for Heaven. We must build it, in our hearts and here as well. If the Antinium all die, who will believe for us? We must believe for those who fall. Believe for ourselves. And live. We must live.”</p>
<p>He put his hands together. All four hands clasped together, and Pawn spoke. He put all his hopes and wishes and fears and regrets into the words that came next.</p>
<p>“Live. Please live.”</p>
<p>He felt his heart breaking. The Soldiers lay on the ground, dead. Dying. His fault. But he prayed.</p>
<p>“Please. Do not die. Live, and help me. Help the Hive. Help each other.”</p>
<p>Was there a whisper? No. A feeling? No. There was just Pawn, alone and hoping and afraid. But as the Soldiers stopped fighting and Workers rushed into the room with bandages and clotting agents, Pawn saw his prayers answered.</p>
<p>“Put the dead over there! I want as many sacs in here as possible! Wake every Worker in the nearby sections! Move! <em>Now!</em>”</p>
<p>Klbkch shouted the orders as Soldiers lay down or sat, letting Workers tend to them. Pawn knelt on the ground, looking at each Soldier as they wavered, fighting to live instead of die. He couldn’t close his eyes, and that was well. Pawn watched each Soldier without turning away, and saw them pull back from the edge.</p>
<p>“I believe I told you not to pray.”</p>
<p>“You did.”</p>
<p>Pawn stared at a Soldier whose stomach had been ripped open. Green blood pooled around the Worker trying to apply a clear gel to stop the blood flow and contain his organs. No matter how hard the Worker tried, he couldn’t make a seal. But Pawn prayed. He hoped and wished and slowly, the gel began to stick.</p>
<p>“Some are dying even though you pray.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Klbkch looked at Pawn. Pawn stared at a dying Soldier, watching him slip away, and then shifted his attention to the next one. And the next.</p>
<p>“What is prayer?”</p>
<p>“I do not know. But I hope. I hope they will live, even if they die. I will continue hoping and believing the next Soldier will live.”</p>
<p>“Regardless of reality?”</p>
<p>“No. I will believe knowing reality. Because that is prayer. Hope for a better reality.”</p>
<p>“Who will you pray to if not a God?”</p>
<p>“I will pray to myself. I will pray to the dead. I will pray to heaven and trust that it exists.”</p>
<p>“Is it enough?”</p>
<p>“I do not know. But if there is a God, I will pray to him, or her, or it, or them if I need to. I will pray to anything or anyone.”</p>
<p>A Soldier lying on the ground, nearly cut in two by Klbkch’s blade, stirred. A Worker stopped dragging him towards a pile of the dead and immediately began pulling him towards the living. Pawn let Klbkch sit beside him. He did not care if he was speaking or silent. He didn’t care that one of Klbkch’s swords was poking into his side.</p>
<p>All of his being was with the Soldiers, trying to pull them back with his own two hands. That was why Pawn ran over when the Workers needed help to turn a Soldier over. He was praying as he held a Soldier’s guts in, and as he fed water to one without a stomach, drop by drop.</p>
<p>Sometime after the last Soldier had been carried away to heal elsewhere, Pawn stood in the center of the room and stared at the dead. He felt each one pulling at his heart, marking his soul. So many. Over a hundred had died, over two hundred probably. All his fault.</p>
<p>But some had lived, and Pawn clung to that. He didn’t look up as Klbkch approached. He just bowed his head.</p>
<p>“If you kill me, will you spare the other Soldiers? They only listened to me.”</p>
<p>“Kill you?”</p>
<p>Klbkch stopped by Pawn’s side. The Revalantor stared at the Worker curiously.</p>
<p>“Why would I kill you? What purpose would it serve?”</p>
<p>“I disobeyed your orders. And I caused the death of countless soldiers.”</p>
<p>“And the rest would have died without you. If I kill you now, they will kill themselves or become Aberration.”</p>
<p>That was true. Pawn nodded.</p>
<p>“Then what?”</p>
<p>“You have a class. [Acolyte], I believe. Perhaps you will level tonight. In fact, I am certain you will.”</p>
<p>Pawn looked up, surprised. Klbkch nodded at him.</p>
<p>“Keep me informed.”</p>
<p>That was it? Pawn looked at Klbkch, confused.</p>
<p>“But what about Gods? Aren’t they a threat?”</p>
<p>“Yes. But you do not pray to a God, do you? And heaven—I see no threat in that.”</p>
<p>“Then—”</p>
<p>“The wounded Soldiers are yours. Care for them, pray for them if it will help them survive. And then test them. I think they may be able to become Individual.”</p>
<p>Pawn stared at Klbkch. The Revalantor looked at him.</p>
<p>“If it will make the Hive stronger, I will let you pray.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“Sleep, and report to me if you level up. That will be all.”</p>
<p>Klbkch nodded to Pawn and began to walk away. Pawn hesitated, and then turned and called after him.</p>
<p>“Klbkchhezeim? Revalantor Klbkch?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>Pawn hesitated. But the fear he had in his chest was a small thing now. Too small after all that had passed to hold him back.</p>
<p>“What were the Antinium? Before, I mean. Why do you fear Gods?”</p>
<p>Klbkch stopped in his tracks. He turned his head, and looked at Pawn slowly.</p>
<p>“What you want to know is secret.”</p>
<p>“I know. But would it harm anyone to tell me?”</p>
<p>“It may.”</p>
<p>“Then do not. But I want to know. Who were we? Who are we?”</p>
<p>Pawn waited for Klbkch to turn away and keep walking. But Klbkch didn’t. He studied Pawn, and then spoke.</p>
<p>“Galuc. His name was Galuc.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Klbkch paused. He looked at Pawn, and then looked through him. He looked at something Pawn couldn’t see.</p>
<p>“He was one of the Centenium, and it is his form you all wear. Galuc, the Builder.”</p>
<p>“You mean…did we once look different?”</p>
<p>Klbkch shrugged.</p>
<p>“I did. But my form was lost when I died at sea. Galuc’s was saved and so he remains in each of you. Smaller, and weaker.”</p>
<p>“What was he like?”</p>
<p>Something like a laugh came out of Klbkch’s mandibles, a sound so odd because Pawn had never heard it before.</p>
<p>“Galuc? He was a giant. Strong. Fearless. He would have laughed to know that the Antinium all look like him.”</p>
<p>“And Gods?”</p>
<p>Klbkch shook his head. He turned and began walking again.</p>
<p>“That is a secret. But if you prove you can turn those Soldiers into something more than they are—I will tell you more.”</p>
<p>He left Pawn alone in the room full of the dead. Pawn stood alone, and then stared around. So much death. The ground was stained green. The bodies lay where they had fallen, ready to be recycled into mush.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t the bodies Pawn looked for. He went to each of the fallen Soldier and stared down at their remains. He wondered where the other part of them had gone. He hoped…it was to a better place. And if there wasn’t one, Pawn would find it, make it, if he had to. The Antinium didn’t just destroy. They could create as well.</p>
<p>Slowly, Pawn walked down into the center of the room. He sat down, put his hands together, and believed.</p>

		<p><em>“We are fragments of the past, Ceria Springwalker. That is all we are.”</em></p>
<p><em>Ceria sat on her great-grandmother’s lap and looked up. The small cottage was covered in hanging herbs, braids of garlic—every time she breathed in, a myriad of spices tickled her nose. She sneezed, and her great-grandmother sighed.<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>“No one has told you yet, have they? They just tell you to stay clear of Humans, which is true enough. But no one’s told you of your other half, your heritage.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I thought we were descended from Elves.”</em></p>
<p><em>“That’s true. But how much of us is Elf? No one even remembers who they were now, do they? They aren’t in any legends—it’s just a word. Even the oldest stories only talk of half-Elves, not Elves.”</em></p>
<p><em>“But they did exist?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Oh yes. But only Dragons would remember them, I think. And even then, only the oldest of Dragons. Yet, we still call ourselves half-Elves after all this time, even though thousands…tens of thousands of years have passed. Why is that?”</em></p>
<p><em>Ceria shifted. Her seat wasn’t that comfortable—her great-grandmother was too bony, and she was holding the young half-Elf tightly in case she slipped away, which is what Ceria wanted to do. She hated questions like these.</em></p>
<p><em>“I don’t know. Because we’re half-Elves? Half and half, right?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Not quite. How could we be half-Elves? Think about it. If an Elf and a Human had a child, </em>that <em>would be a true half-Elf. But their offspring—if they had a child with a Human, then what would you have? A quarter-Elf. And so on.”</em></p>
<p><em>“So?”</em></p>
<p><em>An impatient sigh—Ceria felt her ear tips being flicked and she hunched over sulkily.</em></p>
<p><em>“Think, child. There are no Elves left anymore. Half-Elves either marry each other or they mix with other species. So many generations have passed—what part of us is Elf, do you think?”</em></p>
<p><em>“I don’t know. A quarter—an eighth? Less? Can I go now?”</em></p>
<p><em>The small child wriggled, but her great-grandmother was too strong for her.</em></p>
<p><em>“Not yet. This is important, so sit still or I’ll pinch your ears.”</em></p>
<p><em>Chastened by the threat, Ceria sat as still as possible, trying not to move. She heard a quiet sigh from above.</em></p>
<p><em>“You’re too young. But someone has to tell you and those prideful fools would never speak of this. Ceria, the truth is that after all these long years, our people probably have only a drop of Elven blood in our veins. Only a drop, the smallest fraction of fractions. Only that. We aren’t half-Elves. Not even close.”</em></p>
<p><em>The news didn’t disappoint Ceria, because she didn’t fully understand. </em></p>
<p><em>“So what? We’re all Human?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Again, not quite. Do you want to know something interesting, Ceria?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes? Is it a secret?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Only a small one. The interesting thing is this: when a Human and a half-Elf have a child, the child is always half Elf. Did you know that?”</em></p>
<p><em>“No. Why is it interesting?”</em></p>
<p><em>Another sigh, but this time Ceria didn’t receive a flick to the ear.</em></p>
<p><em>“The interesting thing is that this is always true, Ceria. No matter how many generations pass, a half-Elf with a thousand Human parents on one side will always produce a half-Elf child. No matter what.”</em></p>
<p><em>The young half-Elf sat pensively, and then looked up into the wrinkled face and white hair.</em></p>
<p><em>“What does that mean?”</em></p>
<p><em>“It means that our heritage cannot be erased, child. Not by blood or time. We are part Elf, and that will always ring true. Isn’t that amazing?”</em></p>
<p><em>“I guess.”</em></p>
<p><em>Ceria’s doubtful reply elicited the first laughter from her great-grandmother she’d heard in a long time. The old half-Elf stroked Ceria’s hair gently.</em></p>
<p><em>“It might not seem like much to you yet, but it is something to remember. We are mostly Human, for all the others like to pretend we’re so much better. All we have is a drop of our heritage, Ceria. But it’s enough.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Enough?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Enough. What runs in our veins is a fragment of what we were. An echo of legends past. But it is pure magic in our blood, Ceria. The purest. Even Dragons bowed to Elves as masters of magic. And though the Elves are gone, we remain. It is in our natures; magic. It comes to us easier than any other species, because of who we are. Who we were. The blood of Elves cannot be extinguished, and it calls out even after untold millennia. That which shall never fade.”</em></p>
<p><em>The child caught her breath. She didn’t understand fully, but what she did hear in her great-grandmother’s words called to her. The old woman continued, speaking softly in the quiet of her cottage.</em></p>
<p><em>“We live it. Breathe it. We are magic, and magic is us. So when a spell burns you, or you play with the fish or eat them, remember. The magic will never fade.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Never?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Never. Remember that, will you?”</em></p>
<p><em>“I will. But what does it mean?”</em></p>
<p><em>“It means…in the oldest of tales, the ones only our people tell, the ones I heard as a child from my great-great grandmother, the Elves were said to be immune to charms and curses. They were so deeply magical that any attempt to hex or bewitch them was impossible. Because they were too magical, you understand? The spells just burned away from them.”</em></p>
<p><em>“But half-Elves aren’t like that. You said.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I did. But we have a part of that in us, Ceria. Remember? Just a part, but that means in time, any spell holding you will fail. If I tried to put you to sleep with a spell, eventually you would wake up.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Everyone wakes up, great grandma.”</em></p>
<p><em>A laugh.</em></p>
<p><em>“True. But you would wake up no matter what. No matter how powerful the enchantment on you, it will fade. Slowly, yes, but there is no spell your blood will not break in time.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Really?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Really. But don’t you go letting people cast spells on you, Ceria. And don’t think this makes you better than the Human children. Don’t go near them. You can play with the others in the stream now.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Will you come with me?”</em></p>
<p><em>“No. I have work to do. Just try to remember, won’t you, Ceria? You’re the only family I have left.”</em></p>
<p><em>The young half-Elf didn’t even see the pained expression on her great grandmother’s face. She raced for the door, laughing.</em></p>
<p><em>“I’ll remember! I promise!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Remember, Ceria.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I will! I will, I will, I—”</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>“I will.”</p>
<p>Ceria spoke the words aloud. And then she woke up.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>—-</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was dark. That was all Ceria saw. But in the instant where she was not quite dreaming any longer, and not quite awake, it almost felt like she was dreaming still. The half-Elf tried to move her legs and turn her head, searching for her great grandmother.</p>
<p>Then she woke up a bit more and remembered that her great grandmother was dead. Nearly two decades dead and buried in her garden in a village on another continent.</p>
<p>And then she woke up further, and Ceria felt other sensations flooding in. The first was taste.</p>
<p>Taste. Ceria could taste vomit in her mouth, sour and vile. It was dried and made her gag—and she tasted blood as well. Ceria dry-heaved and scrabbled at her side reflexively. She had a flask of water—</p>
<p>No. She didn’t. And that was when the other feelings hit Ceria at once. She was hungry. In pain. <em>Bleeding?</em> No—but she could feel dried blood on her left shoulder, and cold air on her lower body. In fact…she was naked from the waist down. That was to say, she had her mage’s robes on, but someone had taken her pants.</p>
<p>“Wh—wha—?”</p>
<p>What had happened? Ceria’s mind was still too jumbled for short-term memory. She only knew that she was in pain, and something was horribly wrong. She looked around for her pants, or for the water bottle, but she could see practically nothing in…wherever she was.</p>
<p>It wasn’t totally dark. Ceria could see outlines of something in the darkness. But whatever light source was providing the light, it was too faint. She had to see. Ceria raised one hand and croaked a word.</p>
<p>“[Light].”</p>
<p>A glowing orange ball of pure light floated out of Ceria’s palm and she blinked, dazzled by it. But then her eyes adjusted, and Ceria finally saw the truth of where she was.</p>
<p>She was in the pit. The pit. The place she and the others had been teleported into after the trap. Yes. Ceria remembered. And she was lying on something. A pile of things that moved.</p>
<p>Ceria looked down. Something white, many white and yellow things shone in the light. She reached down to touch one, and stopped.</p>
<p>She was lying on a pile of bones. Bones, and horrible black filth. And some of it had been stained by her vomit. And blood.</p>
<p>She didn’t scream. Ceria didn’t scream, but she immediately rolled off the pile. She rolled down onto something hard and rough. Solid stone, crusted with more of that black substance.</p>
<p>For a few seconds Ceria just lay on the ground, trying not to react to the countless horrors around her. She breathed in slowly, trying to keep calm. The air felt dead and there was a horrible smell.</p>
<p>They were in the pit. Trapped. The half-Elf slowly got to her feet, holding her head. It was aching horribly, and she still felt disoriented. But more memory was coming back to her. Yes, they were trapped. There had been the spell and then—</p>
<p>Sound. Over to her left. Ceria spun, reaching for a dagger which again, she didn’t have. Her robes swirled about her as she spotted something that wasn’t bone or filth in a corner of the circular pit.</p>
<p>A…shape. A body. Ceria squinted and the orb of light at her side grew brighter. Then she saw who was sitting next to a pile of bones.</p>
<p>Ksmvr. The Antinium was moving. Ceria stumbled closer, head ringing, and saw he was moving. Rocking, rather. And then she heard the whisper, low and desperate. Ceria stopped as she heard what the Antinium was saying, whispering.</p>
<p>“no. nO. yeS. No. yES. NO. yEs, YeS—no—”</p>
<p>He was repeating the words over and over and he rocked back and forth in one corner of the room. The Antinium was bleeding, or he had been. Green ichor had dried around his left side, and it looked like something had smashed his carapace and ripped part of it away. A huge area was just…missing, exposing his vulnerable innards soaked with green blood.</p>
<p>Insanity. Now the rest of the pieces of memory fell into Ceria’s head and she remembered. She’d gone insane. Insane, just like everyone else. There had been the spell and then—</p>
<p>Her shoulder hurt. Ceria glanced down and saw a wound in her shoulder. It looked like someone had stabbed her with a dagger. Maybe she’d done it to herself. Ceria didn’t know.</p>
<p>“Ksmvr?”</p>
<p>The word was horrible in her mouth. Ceria nearly retched again as she tasted the foulness in her mouth. But the Antinium didn’t respond. Ceria raised her voice.</p>
<p>“Ksmvr. Can you hear me? Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Again, nothing. Ceria looked away. Ksmvr was lost, and so was Yvlon and Pisces, wherever they were. She had to get out of this pit, figure out a way to undo the spell.</p>
<p>The spell. Ceria looked around wildly and her headache grew worse. That was right. She had to disable the spell! Had she thought that before? No? Yes?</p>
<p>The mark of [Insanity] was on one of the walls. It was the other half of the light in the room, that faint, ghostly glow. Ceria caught sight of it as she looked around wildly. There. It was on one of the far walls, high up in the pit. She looked away the instant she spotted it, but too late.</p>
<p>Her headache grew worse. Suddenly, Ceria realized what was happening. Her innate half-Elven nature had helped her fight off the enchantment, but it was still active. And it was trying—</p>
<p>Trying to make her crazy again. Ceria lurched towards the sign and looked up again. It was high on the wall, too high to climb to. She caught a glimpse of the runes again and closed her eyes, but too late. The magic washed over her mind, trying to control her.</p>
<p>“Can’t. I need—”</p>
<p>Against her will, Ceria’s eyes opened. She twisted her head to stare at one of the filthy black walls, but now she knew the symbol was there. And she wanted to look. Had to look. She had to. It was the only thing that made <em>sense.</em></p>
<p>The symbol flashed in her brain, and Ceria turned her head to look back at it. She couldn’t help herself. The magic runes bored into her retinas, overwhelming her senses. Ceria grinned, bit through her lower lip—</p>
<p>And went insane again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He knew he was insane. It was the one conscious, deliberate thought in his head. Ksmvr rocked back and forth as he stared into the darkness of the pit. His trap. His hell.</p>
<p>The magic spell flashed in the peripherals of his vision. No matter how Ksmvr tried to look away, he couldn’t. The magic was too pervasive, and he was too weak.</p>
<p>He was insane. Ksmvr had to remember that. It was the only knowledge he could cling to. That, and his own nature.</p>
<p>He was Antinium, and so despite being insane, there was still a part of Ksmvr that could think, could try to act. The Antinium had no spell casters, or at least, none that Ksmvr knew of. But they were familiar with the dangers of enchantments and illusions, so safeguards had been built into their very natures when each Antinium was created.</p>
<p>One of those protections was an innate resistance to mental trickery. The Antinium had their own way of fighting off hostile enchantments. So it was that while Ksmvr was functionally insane, part of him was fighting back, trying to seize control of his body. It was an effective bit of mental conditioning that made the Antinium so effective in battle. It didn’t work in regards to Aberrations of course—</p>
<p>That was different. But Ksmvr could still think, as mired in the [Insanity] spell as he was. So he noted Ceria’s actions. The half-Elf had been stumbling towards the pulsing runes, but now she turned back and lay on the ground, laughing and choking on the blood gushing from her lip.</p>
<p>This was the third time the half-Elf had awoken and gone insane. Ksmvr had counted that. He had logged each occurrence in his mind. At first he’d thought it was just chance, but now he was sure. She could break the enchantment. She could, but within moments she would relapse.</p>
<p>Because of the symbol. It pulsed, and Ksmvr felt his mind being pulled to pieces again. He shuddered and tried to concentrate. He had to act.</p>
<p>But the insane bit of him didn’t want to. So Ksmvr was fighting.</p>
<p>“No. Yes. nO. Yes. on. Yes.”</p>
<p>He was weak. Ksmvr fought to stand up as the insecurities of his mind preyed on him with the effects of the spell. He wasn’t worthy of being a Prognugator. They’d been right to take that away from him.</p>
<p>Klbkch was superior to him in every way. His Queen was right to exile him. He was useless. He hadn’t contributed anything to the team. They’d only accepted him out of pity. If Klbkch was here, he wouldn’t have gone insane.</p>
<p>The knowledge haunted Ksmvr. He was pathetic. And yet, he still tried to stand up. He had to do something. He was the only one who could. There was no Klbkch to give him orders, no Queen to do the same. He had to do it himself.</p>
<p>One leg. Ksmvr <em>twitched</em> and <em>shook </em>horribly, trying to make his rusty limbs move. He’d done it once before. He’d taken Ceria’s pants and her belt. Hadn’t that been harder than anything he’d ever done before? But he’d done it. Now he had to stand up again.</p>
<p>Ceria’s magical ball of light illuminated a trembling form as, in the corner of the pit illuminated by the light, Ksmvr stood up. He shook, and then lurched towards Ceria, holding something in one of his hands. He tripped over bones, crawled—desperate to get to her in time.</p>
<p>The half-Elf was still lying on the ground, grinning upwards. She was spitting out blood into the air and trying to make it land on her face. Ksmvr ignored that and seized her head. Ceria made no move as he lifted her upwards.</p>
<p>Slowly, he tied the strip of fabric he’d cut from Ceria’s pants around her eyes, tying the knot securely to fasten the blindfold. Ksmvr’s hands shook as he finished the knot. He slowly backed away from Ceria and felt the madness overwhelming his conditioning again.</p>
<p>The part of Ksmvr that could still think steered his body away from Ceria. He walked back over to his corner and sat down. Then Ksmvr gave up and let the madness sweep over him again. His mouth began to chant, the distorted words echoing around him.</p>
<p>“Yes. yES, YeS, YES, yEs, Yes, yeS…”</p>
<p>His fingers scrabbled at the exposed chitin on his side. Ksmvr slowly, painfully, pulled part of his exoskeleton off, feeling it break as he ripped it from his side. He put the chip of black armor up to his mouth, and his mandibles opened. Ksmvr crunched the bit of himself down as he rocked back and forwards again. He slowly reached down and did it again. And again. And again—</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ceria remembered falling in love when she was twenty three. Trying to sneak off with the young half-Elf boy in her village—being caught. She had a dream where she ate her great grandmother and buried what was left beneath a blooming cocoon where something lived and tried to burst out.</p>
<p>Then she woke up. Again. This time, Ceria sat up and felt the pain of her lip first. She touched at it, nearly screaming at the pain. Then she realized she couldn’t see a thing.</p>
<p>She cast [Light] several times before she realized there was a blindfold on her head. Ceria reached for it. Her fingers scrabbled on the cloth, but they were too weak to undo the sturdy knot Ksmvr had tied. And before she could rip it off her face, Ceria’s memories came back.</p>
<p>The spell! The ward! It had made her crazy again. Again! Ceria remembered coming back into consciousness several times before that, but each time the symbol had—</p>
<p>The blindfold on her face. Ceria felt at it and realized something had happened. She wasn’t sure what, but this was the only thing keeping her from looking at the symbol and going insane. Her head still hurt, but it was bearable this time.</p>
<p>And now Ceria Springwalker knew exactly what she had to do. She had to destroy that damn symbol, or at least cover it somehow.</p>
<p>And she had to do it without seeing. For a few minutes, Ceria just sat on the ground, trying not to scream as all of these thoughts came crashing down. She fumbled at her broken lip and found the hole, touched the wound on her shoulder and realized she was half-naked again. At least she hadn’t taken off her underwear in her craze.</p>
<p>Not that it would have mattered. Ceria didn’t know where the other three Horns of Hammerad were. She knew Ksmvr was close by, but he’d been unresponsive last she checked.</p>
<p>“Okay, focus Ceria.”</p>
<p>She muttered to herself and spat out some blood as she tried to concentrate. The first thing Ceria did was conjure a stream of water out of the air. She washed out her mouth and spat several times until the worst of the blood and vomit was gone. She was terribly thirsty, but she knew better than to drink the magical water she’d created. It would just mess with her body and dissipate soon enough.</p>
<p>“Should’ve learned [Create Water].”</p>
<p>Ceria muttered to herself as she stood up and tried to find her way to one of the walls. It was horrible being blind. She kept running into piles of bones and things she wasn’t sure of, which was far worse. But Ceria moved forwards, climbing over bones, slipping, falling, getting back up until at last her fingers touched something hard and rough and flat.</p>
<p>The wall. It was coated with that same black, flaking substance she’d felt on the floor earlier. Ceria pulled her hands back in revulsion, but now she knew where she was. She remembered the symbol had been high up, but she didn’t know where.</p>
<p>How was she going to do this? The only thing Ceria could think was that she had to take off her blindfold and cast a spell as fast as she could, but even that felt like a mistake. At the very least, she could follow the wall. It wasn’t as if Ceria’s blindfold was perfect; she could still sense some light. And if she dispelled her [Light] spell and followed the source of that faint light…</p>
<p>Ceria stumbled around the perimeter of the dark pit, feeling her way ahead and kicking bones and other things out of the way as she held one hand to the wall. She was in a massive pit, at least forty feet across by her count. It was clearly meant to capture hundreds of people, and from the bones Ceria kept running into, it might have already served its purpose countless times.</p>
<p>The light, the piercing light that made her want to tear off her blindfold kept getting brighter and brighter. In the darkness, it was Ceria’s only guide. She stopped where she thought the light was the brightest—she couldn’t look in any direction without it growing dimmer.</p>
<p>“Here?”</p>
<p>Ceria raised her skeletal hand upwards, trying to figure out where to aim. She remembered…the symbol was about ten feet off the floor? Higher? Maybe a bit.</p>
<p>What spell should she use? Ceria was under no illusions. Anyone who could cast a spell like [Insanity] and anchor it here was probably a far better mage than she was, and they would have protected the runes with wards that her best spells—[Ice Spike] or [Fireball]—would fail to overcome. What should she do then?</p>
<p>Ceria remembered the black gunk that she’d touched on all the walls and the floor. It was everywhere. Maybe that was the answer.</p>
<p>“Cover it.”</p>
<p>Yes, if she covered the spell, it would lose a lot of its power. Ceria didn’t know any spells that could create smoke or fog, but she could always improvise. It wasn’t easy to make new spells, but altering existing ones…</p>
<p>First, Ceria made water appear out of the air. She held it in place, and then materialized earth, as if she was going to use the [Stone Dart] spell. Earth and water. She mixed the two together, and felt thick mud trickling between her fingers. She smiled, winced, as the pain in her lip flared, and lifted the ball of mud up.</p>
<p>It wasn’t even a spell, really. It was just using the basic theories of magic to create…well, an inefficient mess. If she’d known the spell—[Mud Ball] perhaps—she would have been able to use it far more effectively and with less mana.</p>
<p>But this would do. Ceria held the sloppy mess between her hands as she tried to figure out where to throw it. The spell would last for a while if she put enough mana into it, enough time to cover the damn rune. But where was it—</p>
<p>“What are you doing, boy? Shirking your duties again?”</p>
<p>The harsh voice in her ear made Ceria shout in surprise and jump away. But a cold hand caught her in a steely grip, and a sharp sensation from her side made Ceria freeze in terror. A familiar voice whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>“Trying to hide in the library? Not on my watch.”</p>
<p>“Pisces?”</p>
<p>It was his voice, but not him. Pisces would never have thrown Ceria backwards as the man did now, and he would never have threatened her with a weapon. The young man Ceria had known had always hated physical violence, regardless of how he had changed in every other respect.</p>
<p>This person was not the same. He held her in place, driving the sharp object into Ceria’s side, cutting into her flesh. What was it? A knife?</p>
<p>No—jagged edges. Bone. Ceria shuddered as Pisces’ voice grated in her ears.</p>
<p>“I’ve told you once; you get up and you do the practice every day, before dawn! Anything less and I’ll have your hide.”</p>
<p>Ceria held her breath. She knew Pisces was as deadly with a rapier as he was with spells. In his hands, the jagged length of bone might well kill her before she could take him out with a spell. Carefully, she tried her most soothing voice possible.</p>
<p>“Pisces, it’s me. Ceria—”</p>
<p>“What? <em>What? </em>You don’t get to call me names, boy. My name is ‘sir’ until you can prove you can handle a blade!”</p>
<p>The shard of bone dug deeper in Ceria’s side. She gasped—she could feel it piercing her skin.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, sir.”</p>
<p>“Better! Now, why aren’t you in the training grounds?”</p>
<p>The pressure eased on her. Slightly. Ceria’s hands were clenched. She had no idea what to say to him. What could she say to a madman who thought he was his father?</p>
<p>“I—can’t see.”</p>
<p>“What? Stop talking nonsense!”</p>
<p>“No—look!”</p>
<p>Ceria pointed to her blindfold. Pisces must have been able to see in the dim light, because he paused. His voice sounded approving.</p>
<p>“Blindfold, eh? Good lad. Helps with your reflexes. Now, dodge <em>this—</em>”</p>
<p>She only had a moment’s warning before the sharp feeling in her side vanished. Ceria felt air moving and ducked. But the blow Pisces gave her was a kick to the stomach. The half-Elf dropped to her hands and knees and retched. Above her, Pisces laughed nastily.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to move faster than that if you want to become a true [Fencer], brat.”</p>
<p>The pain was nauseating, but at least she didn’t throw up; there was nothing left. Ceria gritted her teeth as she stood up. The mud was still in her good hand. If she threw it—</p>
<p>“Pis—sir, I need to get rid of that rune up there. Could you help me with that?”</p>
<p>“Rune? What rune? Stop talking rot, boy! There will be no magic in my household. If you’ve been making sparks—”</p>
<p>“No, that rune! There!”</p>
<p>“That? That’s just the moon. What, is it too bright for your eyes? Take off your blindfold and let’s begin already!”</p>
<p>Ceria let out a despairing groan. It was no good. Pisces was trapped in his imaginary world. She had to do something. But what?</p>
<p>“I’m waiting, boy. Don’t make me impatient!”</p>
<p>Ceria hesitated. She clenched her fist, and then heard another voice, growing closer. This one was dignified, and each syllable was carefully enunciated with a delicate inflection in the woman’s voice.</p>
<p>“What is this commotion all about? Do you people not know what time it is?”</p>
<p>It was Yvlon’s voice, raised to sound more high-pitched. Ceria groaned. Perfect. Another insane person was all she needed. Her first thought was that Yvlon might be persuaded to help even in her delirium, but then she remembered how most Humans treated half-Elves. And a second thought on the heels of the first: she had a sword. Ceria grew very still with fear, but Pisces raised his voice as he apparently turned towards Yvlon.</p>
<p>“Well there you are, boy! Ready for morning practice at last, or do I have to burn all those damn books of yours to get you to pay attention?”</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon?”</p>
<p>Yvlon’s outraged voice gave Ceria hope. Pisces was snapping at her as if she was…Ceria? He wasn’t differentiating between Yvlon and Ceria at all. They were all the same to him. They were all ‘boy’, which was to say…Pisces. Ceria knew who the man she heard in Pisces’ voice had to be.</p>
<p>His father.</p>
<p>And he was trying to train Pisces. But Yvlon wasn’t cooperating. She gasped with indignation, and then, all of a sudden, her voice changed, grew deeper.</p>
<p>“I am Ylawes Byres, [Swordsman] and heir to the Byres name. Who are you to challenge me with weapon in hand, stranger?”</p>
<p>“Y—what? Are you pretending to be a nobleman? I’ll knock that arrogance right out of you.”</p>
<p>“You would do well to lower your weapon. I am armed—”</p>
<p>“I’ll take you on, old man!”</p>
<p>Ceria shouted the words and ducked away from the two, heart racing as she stumbled in another direction. She heard a grunt of surprise, but then a harsh laugh from Pisces.</p>
<p>“Challenging your old man at last? Fine then, I’ll draw your blood as a lesson!”</p>
<p>She heard footsteps, but not towards her. Yvlon’s outraged voice echoed off one of the walls as Ceria crept away.</p>
<p>“You dare to bare your blade against me? I’ll have your head for that!”</p>
<p>This time Ceria heard ringing metal as Ceria unsheathed her own blade. She heard another laugh, and then a <em>grunt </em>as she heart the <em>thunk</em> of something striking metal. Yvlon cried out in outrage as Ceria looked around wildly.</p>
<p>Her two team mates were about to kill each other. Pisces was a skilled fighter, but Yvlon was in armor. Either way, one of them would die unless Ceria hurried.</p>
<p>Where was the magic symbol? Ceria looked up and saw a glow around the edges of her blindfold. She raised the mud and threw it as hard as she could. She heard a splatter, but the light didn’t dim.</p>
<p>“Damn it. Where—”</p>
<p>More mud. Ceria slopped it into her hands and threw it again, but she sensed the mud splattered in the air rather than staying in a ball. She cursed again and tried to mush the mud together. She threw wildly, but nothing changed.</p>
<p>“There? There!?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t working, and Ceria could heard Yvlon cursing as she struck the ground and Pisces taunted her. Ceria raised her arm, and then heard a voice.</p>
<p>“Not there.”</p>
<p>She jerked, but it was Ksmvr. He was calling out to her across the room.</p>
<p>“To the left and down slightly.”</p>
<p>Ceria didn’t hesitate. She adjusted her aim and threw.</p>
<p>“You missed. A bit higher and more left.”</p>
<p>Desperately, Ceria poured earth into her hands and added water. She molded a sopping mudball and took aim. She heard Yvlon cry out in pain and aimed desperately. She threw into the darkness.</p>
<p>“Ah—”</p>
<p>The light went out. Instantly, Ceria tore the blindfold away from her head. The world was absolute darkness.</p>
<p>“[Light]!”</p>
<p>This time, the flare of light was a dark green, and it didn’t burn her eyes. Ceria looked around wildly, and saw two struggling shapes fighting over a sword.</p>
<p>The magic had ceased, at least for now, but the others were still insane. Ceria ran towards both of them and cried out as she raised her right hand.</p>
<p>“Stop! [Stone Fist]!”</p>
<p>Yvlon turned and raised her arm for only a second before the stone hand smashed into her chest. She fell backwards and Ceria turned and knocked Pisces backwards with a backhanded swipe. He stumbled back, staring at the gauntlet made of rock that covered Ceria’s good hand.</p>
<p>“Magic? You dare? I’ll make you suffer for this!”</p>
<p>His eyes were wild and he had Yvlon’s sword. Ceria raised her skeletal hand warningly.</p>
<p>“Don’t make me do this, Pisces.”</p>
<p>“I told you, I’m not—”</p>
<p>“Ceria!”</p>
<p>Ksmvr appeared in a shower of bones. Pisces leapt back as a few flew towards him, and then narrowed his eyes at the Antinium. He said not a word, but charged with a wild cry. But Ceria was faster.</p>
<p>“[Ice Shard].”</p>
<p>The frozen icicle that shot from her finger flew as straight as an arrow, but the difference in this one was that the head was blunt, rather than sharp. It struck Pisces squarely in the forehead as he leapt at her, and he staggered. Ksmvr shoulder-charged him to the ground and struck him with one hand. Pisces sagged, and he went limp.</p>
<p>“Dead gods.”</p>
<p>Ceria took one deep breath and then another. Ksmvr lowered Pisces to the ground as Ceria sat down hard—on a piece of bone. She yelped and tossed the yellowed thing across the room.</p>
<p>“Ceria Springwalker, are you well?”</p>
<p>“Me? I’m—fine.”</p>
<p>She could taste blood and her lower lip had a hole in it. Her right shoulder still burned and Pisces had drawn blood with that damn bone. She was <em>not</em> fine, but other things were more important.</p>
<p>“Where’s Yvlon?”</p>
<p>“Over there.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr pointed and Ceria saw Yvlon standing and staring blankly ahead. The woman’s blonde hair was matted with blood, and she had a deep cut down one cheek where Pisces must have struck her. But she didn’t appear to notice any of that. She looked over haughtily as Ceria and Ksmvr approached.</p>
<p>“Yvlon?”</p>
<p>“I am Yelen Byres—”</p>
<p>“Rot, she’s still under the spell.”</p>
<p>Ceria sighed. Ksmvr looked uncertainly at Yvlon.</p>
<p>“Should we knock her out?”</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon?”</p>
<p>“No. I don’t think that’s wise. Let’s just tie her hands and legs up so she can’t hurt us if her personality changes again.”</p>
<p>“That is wise.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr approached Yvlon. The armored woman backed away, raising her voice in outrage.</p>
<p>“I’m sure I’ve never been so offended—unhand me, you—!”</p>
<p>She clawed at Ksmvr, but her two hands were no match for his three. In a few minutes he had her trussed up and lying in a clear part of the pit. Yvlon shouted angrily at them until Ceria stuffed her blindfold into the woman’s mouth. Yvlon spat it out and she began gnawing at the ropes like an animal. It wasn’t ideal, but at least it kept her occupied.</p>
<p>That done, Ceria had to take a few seconds just to breathe. While she was doing that, she finally took a good look around the pit she’d found herself in. The dark room was lit by her green light and it made the lurid piles of remains all the more disturbing.</p>
<p>Swords, bones, rotted fabric. The pit was a huge tomb of bodies, corpses and yellowed bones, all that remained countless adventurers who’d been trapped here. Time had eaten away almost all the details of these fallen people, but Ceria could still see some clues as to how they’d died. A skull split by the worn shaft of an axe, a skeleton cut in two here, and one whose bones looked scorched—</p>
<p>“What a nightmare.”</p>
<p>Ceria shuddered as Ksmvr came to stand next to her. She looked at the Antinium and saw that he was holding his injured side, where a good section of his chitin had been picked away.</p>
<p>“Are you okay, Ksmvr?”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“I am only moderately inconvenienced, Captain. As soon as you covered the magical symbol I regained use of my mind.”</p>
<p>“Good. That’s…good.”</p>
<p>Ceria breathed in and out a few more times. She could still remember being insane, remember the sensation of losing all the structure in her head. She looked at Ksmvr, and then remembered she was still half-naked.</p>
<p>“Where are my pants? And my belt—did you see them, Ksmvr?”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“I removed them to construct your blindfold. My apologies. They are over here.”</p>
<p>The Antinium retrieved Ceria’s possessions and she put her pants back on with a sigh of relief. The Antinium had cut a large strip out from one of the legs, but some clothing was better than none. She sat on the ground and began attaching her belt.</p>
<p>More importantly, with Ceria’s belt came her water flask and the healing potion she’d brought. She greedily drank water from her flask while she offered the healing potion to Ksmvr. He applied half to his torn-up side and handed it back to Ceria. She hesitated, and then drank the potion rather than apply it to each of her wounds.</p>
<p>“Gah! That’s foul.”</p>
<p>Ceria tossed the empty bottle to one side and winced as it smashed. Ksmvr hesitated, and then sat next to her.</p>
<p>“That was a most dangerous trap we were caught in.”</p>
<p>“You think?”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>The half-Elf shook her head.</p>
<p>“We nearly died. If it hadn’t been for my heritage and luck—how long were we under the spell?”</p>
<p>“I cannot say.”</p>
<p>Beside her, Ksmvr shifted to look at Ceria. His normally impassive voice changed slightly, grew a bit uncertain.</p>
<p>“Do you believe that spell will affect Pisces and Yvlon for much longer?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Ceria rubbed at her face.</p>
<p>“Maybe? It might wear off soon, but you never know. At least it wasn’t real insanity that hit us, just the spell.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>Ksmvr looked at her. Ceria nodded tiredly, feeling the healing potion getting to work on the rest of her body.</p>
<p>“It’s just the magical effect. Real insanity—you’d have to be a better mage to really create madness in people. This is just…an approximation. The spell reaches into your head and messes up your world. It’s close, but not the same.”</p>
<p>“I see. That would explain my experience.”</p>
<p>The Antinium nodded a few times as he sat next to Ceria. He hesitated, and then cleared his throat awkwardly.</p>
<p>“If the spell had created true insanity in me, I would have become Aberration at once. And then I would have killed all three of you within seconds.”</p>
<p>Ceria just looked at him. How was she supposed to respond to that? But maybe that was Ksmvr’s way of saying he was glad things had worked out. She thought for a second, and then looked at the place where he’d sliced her pants apart.</p>
<p>“Ksmvr? You said you made the blindfold for me?”</p>
<p>He nodded. Cautiously.</p>
<p>“Yes. I was…unable to do more. I regret my failure to act, but—”</p>
<p>“Good job.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Thank you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ceria and Ksmvr sat in silence for over twenty minutes before Pisces woke up. He came to with a shout of surprise, which turned into a groan.</p>
<p>“My <em>head…</em>”</p>
<p>He didn’t appear to be insane, but Ceria and Ksmvr were ready for anything as he staggered upright. Pisces took one look around at them, at the bones, and the foul pit they were in, and then he asked if they had anything to eat. That reassured them he was back to normal.</p>
<p>Ceria had a thing about bones, in that she didn’t like seeing them, especially if they were her bones. Add that to the general unsanitary nature of the pit, with the black foreign substance crusting every part of the room, and she was feeling quite unhappy with their current predicament. But Pisces seemed to regard the dead bodies as mere furnishings, and he happily crammed some dried meat into his mouth.</p>
<p>“So you and Ksmvr eliminated the spell? Most efficacious. Allow me to congratulate the both of you. I was completely subsumed by the enchantment. What was my reaction to the [Insanity] spell, incidentally?”</p>
<p>“You thought you were your father.”</p>
<p>Pisces paused mid-chew.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>“And you tried to run both me and Yvlon through.”</p>
<p>“I apologize for that. I am relieved I was so ineffectual.”</p>
<p>He chewed the rest of his bite slowly, and swallowed, no longer looking quite as pleased. Pisces glanced over to Yvlon. She was still drooling on the bindings on her wrist, looking more than a little rabid.</p>
<p>“…Perhaps we should leave before your mud wears off. I would not like to repeat such a harrowing experience.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded. That was her first thought too, but…</p>
<p>“How the hell are we going to get out?”</p>
<p>The pit was dark, and as far as she could see, the walls extended upwards at least thirty feet. If there was a ceiling, it wasn’t within her [Light] spell’s cone of illumination.</p>
<p>Pisces looked up. He frowned and conjured a ball of light himself and threw it upwards.</p>
<p>“Let’s find out.”</p>
<p>His orb glowed with pure white light. Ksmvr and Ceria both saw it fly upwards, and then break—splash, really, the light becoming fading motes—across a dirt ceiling. Ceria groaned and Pisces made a similar noise of displeasure.</p>
<p>“We’re trapped.”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded, looking unhappy.</p>
<p>“Who knows how deep we are? We could dig up for years and not reach the surface.”</p>
<p>“Not necessarily.”</p>
<p>Both mages looked at Ksmvr. The Antinium nodded as he stared upwards.</p>
<p>“There must be an entrance higher up. Companion Pisces, if you recast your spell, I believe we may be able to identify an opening.”</p>
<p>“What makes you assume that, Ksmvr?”</p>
<p>Ceria looked curiously at the Antinium. He looked back at her without a shred of doubt as he replied.</p>
<p>“If this room were truly a sealed chamber, we and those who have preceded us would have quickly used up the supply of air within the room. The fact that we did not suffocate instantly indicates an air source of some kind.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Pisces looked at Ceria and then both mages threw orbs of [Light] upwards again. After a minute of studying the ceiling, Ksmvr exclaimed and pointed.</p>
<p>“There.”</p>
<p>Pisces squinted upwards, frowning.</p>
<p>“Are you certain? I cannot see anything.”</p>
<p>“My eyes are used to the dark. There is an opening there. If we dig, we will most likely find some sort of passageway.”</p>
<p>“So now we just have to get to it. Any ideas?”</p>
<p>Ceria eyed the smooth walls doubtfully. Aside from the black coating, the stone looked unblemished. Pisces just smirked as he stroked his chin.</p>
<p>“This issue should be easily surmounted. Allow me to rectify my earlier deficiency.”</p>
<p>He clicked his fingers, and Ceria felt the room move. Not the ground or the walls, but everything else in it. The bones of the countless dead began to <em>shift.</em></p>
<p>“Pisces?”</p>
<p>He just smiled as yellowed bones began flying into the air and upwards. Ksmvr stared at the shifting bones without comment, but on the ground Yvlon stopped biting at her robes and screamed.</p>
<p>“<em>Necromancer! </em>Kill him at once!”</p>
<p>“Oh hush.”</p>
<p>Pisces frowned and pointed at Yvlon. Two piles of bones stood up and became skeletons. They walked over to hold her down as she wriggled and tried to break free of her bindings.</p>
<p>“No! Don’t touch me! Stop!”</p>
<p>She wailed—Ceria had never heard Yvlon make any sound like that before—as the skeletons held her in place. Yvlon thrashed wildly, but she was unable to break free. The real Yvlon might have mustered the strength, but Yelen Byres, whoever she was, was a weak noblewoman who couldn’t do a thing.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, the other bones were floating in the air, rearranging themselves. They weren’t forming a creature—instead, Ceria saw with horrified fascination, they were forming a staircase. Small bones and big ones ordered themselves into smooth ledges, and, step-by-step, an ivory staircase built itself upwards, leading to the spot Ksmvr had indicated.</p>
<p>Pisces wiped some sweat off his forehead and exhaled a few times as the last bone flew into the horrific set of steps. He smiled cheerfully at Ceria and Ksmvr, both of whom were giving him the fisheye.</p>
<p>“There. We have a way up, and the means to dig as well.”</p>
<p>“I guess?”</p>
<p>Ceria looked uneasily at the staircase. She did <em>not</em> like Necromancy, but neither was she stupid enough to turn down a good solution. Ksmvr just stared at the bones and nodded.</p>
<p>“Efficient.”</p>
<p>Only Yvlon was upset. She screamed at the skeletons as they lifted her up, staggering under the weight of her armor. Pisces frowned—he waved his hand and several more skeletons stood up out of the collection of bones still littering the floor.</p>
<p>“It appears that this trap, however temporarily detrimental to our health, has one unexpected benefit. I can conjure as many skeletons as I need to from this supply.”</p>
<p>“And you won’t run out of mana? I know you’ve got to be tired, and we don’t exactly have any mana potions to spare.”</p>
<p>Ceria looked doubtfully at Pisces. He hesitated.</p>
<p>“I have used quite a bit. But it seems wiser to expend my resources in creating more undead to aid us, especially given our weakened states.”</p>
<p>“True. Okay, summon as many as you can.”</p>
<p>“These five will do for now. I shall begin digging upwards, unless Ksmvr thinks it will cause a collapse?”</p>
<p>Ksmvr studied the dirt roof and shook his head.</p>
<p>“It should be fine.”</p>
<p>“Very well then.”</p>
<p>Pisces pointed upwards, at the small dark crevice in the ceiling. Two skeletons ran up the staircase and began digging energetically at the spot, showering dirt into the pit below. They were holding rusted blades and pieces of metal—the remains of some of the adventurer’s gear.</p>
<p>“It should take them just a little while to clear the obstruction!”</p>
<p>Pisces shouted down cheerily as he walked up to supervise his skeletons. Ceria shook her head as she found a place to sit on the now-cleared floor of the pit. She wasn’t going up that staircase more than once; solid it may be, but Pisces had opted not to build guardrails, and the bones hovered in the air without any solid supports. It was an amazing piece of magic, but it still made her queasy to imagine climbing it.</p>
<p>She’d have to in the end, but that was later. To take her mind off of that, Ceria looked around. Now that the ground was clear, she saw something that had been buried under a pile of bones. Cautiously, Ceria walked over to it. It was dark and bulky, and at first she thought it was a part of an adventurer that had yet to rot. But this wasn’t meat. Instead, Ceria found dark, rough fabric. She cast another [Light] spell and saw what it was clearly.</p>
<p>It was an adventurer’s pack, still neatly secured to the skeleton of its owner. Ceria hesitated, and then shifted the bones aside and lifted the bag. It was quite heavy.</p>
<p>“Ksmvr, here’s something else. Can you take it?”</p>
<p>The Antinium walked over and hoisted the pack easily. Ceria nodded to him, and then heard a shout from above.</p>
<p>“I see light! We’re right below the tunnel we uncovered!”</p>
<p>Both adventurers below sighed in relief. Pisces grinned at them from above, and then shouted.</p>
<p>“Watch out!”</p>
<p>They saw a skeleton falling from above, brought down by a cascade of dirt. Pisces blew away the dirt around him with a barrier of air and Ceria and Ksmvr covered Yvlon, shielding their heads as the skeleton struck the floor of the pit and <em>shattered.</em></p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“Fine!”</p>
<p>Ksmvr shouted up as Ceria looked around. The flailing skeleton hadn’t done any damage to the staircase, but her blood ran cold when she saw something glinting on the side of the pit.</p>
<p>“Dead gods! Watch the sides!”</p>
<p>Pisces looked down and <em>swore.</em> The flailing skeleton had, in its fall, struck the black, encrusted wall of the pit. In doing so, he’d knocked some of the unnamed substance free, and glowing behind the covering was the unmistakable symbol of the [Insanity] spell.</p>
<p>Both Ceria and Pisces reacted with the speed of panic. She threw mud and he blew a cloud of dust in front of the spell before it could work on them. The partially visible runes disappeared as Ceria hurled more mud to cover it and stopped, panting heavily.</p>
<p>“That was quite dangerous.”</p>
<p>“You think?”</p>
<p>Ceria wiped cold sweat from her forehead as she stared at the spot. She looked around the pit and shuddered as she suddenly realized the true nature of the trap.</p>
<p>“Runes underneath…? All the walls must be covered in the [Insanity] spell.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr looked around.</p>
<p>“Truly? That would be a most dangerous effect. It is fortunate that previous adventurers managed to coat the walls.”</p>
<p>“You’re telling me. If we’d been exposed to the spell from all sides, we wouldn’t have had a chance.”</p>
<p>Ceria wondered what the black substance was. She looked down at a flake of it on the ground. It was almost like tar—although spread quite thin. It couldn’t be magic; even the best spells faded after time. An [Alchemist]’s concoction of some kind? Whoever it was, Ceria gave her quiet thanks to them for doing what they had.</p>
<p>“I see light! The tunnel’s wide enough! I’m going up!”</p>
<p>Pisces shouted down to Ksmvr and Ceria after a few more minutes of dirt falling. She raised a hand in acknowledgment.</p>
<p>“Be careful!”</p>
<p>Pisces disappeared above. After a few seconds, he poked his head down.</p>
<p>“Come on up! Ascend carefully—my skeletons will help you!”</p>
<p>Ceria and Ksmvr didn’t need the help of the skeletons to walk upwards, although they did move quite slowly and deliberately to avoid slipping. But Yvlon had to be dragged up by three skeletons, all of them holding her as tightly as possible as she cursed and struggled, oblivious to the drop.</p>
<p>It was a small tunnel that Pisces’ skeletons had dug upwards. They’d followed the already-existing passageway and broken into the very same tunnel where Ceria and the other Horns of Hammerad had been walking earlier. Pisces pulled Ceria out of the pit, coughing as she shook herself to get most of the dirt off. Ksmvr easily clambered out of the ground and helped the skeletons pull Yvlon up. She was still screaming curses at Pisces.</p>
<p>“Foul [Necromancer]! My father will have your head for your sorcery, do you hear me? If it’s a ransom you want, he’ll pay it. Only do not touch a hair on my head! The Byres family will not tolerate any—”</p>
<p>“I am concerned about comrade Yvlon’s mental state, Captain.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr calmly held a hand over Yvlon’s mouth. She shouted into his hand as he addressed Ceria.</p>
<p>“She has not awoken from the effects of the spell. Should we knock her out to aid in that process?”</p>
<p>Ceria shook her head as she looked around.</p>
<p>“She’s not a [Mage] like Pisces or me, and she doesn’t have…whatever you have, Ksmvr. The spell will take longer to wear off, but I’m sure it will in time.”</p>
<p>“I see. Then, what should we do? Press on or wait?”</p>
<p>“Can we just—wait a second?”</p>
<p>Ceria panted as she sat down on the smooth, wonderfully solid stone floor. Pisces sat down as well, and after a pause, so did Ksmvr.</p>
<p>“We’re alive. We were in the worst of traps but—we’re alive.”</p>
<p>Pisces and Ksmvr nodded. Yvlon drooled on the ground around Ksmvr’s hand. Ceria sighed. She lay back on the ground, stretching out. She wanted to shake and cry and laugh and vomit. They’d made it. It wasn’t the first time she’d gotten out of a hairy situation but this—</p>
<p>This had been one of the worst. And they’d done it as a team. No one had died. For a few minutes, ten, really, she just lay there. Then Pisces coughed.</p>
<p>“As unpleasant as that last obstacle was, it occurs to me that we must have been underground for a long time. Hours, perhaps.”</p>
<p>“Days?”</p>
<p>“Maybe. I cannot be certain. But it is clear that we have two options as of now. We can either retreat and regroup with the knowledge of these advanced deterrents, or…we can advance.”</p>
<p>He pointed. Ceria looked, and saw the door. The damn <em>door.</em> They’d come out in the last part of the passageway, almost directly in front of the door that had sent them into the trap in the first place.</p>
<p>“You’re telling me that thing just teleported us down?”</p>
<p>“It’s the most efficient use of mana. It only makes sense.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr nodded.</p>
<p>“It is a formidable obstacle, but now that we have uncovered the danger, is it worth moving forwards? We are nearly out of food, and we all require rest.”</p>
<p>“What do you think, Ceria?”</p>
<p>The half-Elf looked up at Pisces. He looked down at her, quite innocently. But there was a gleam in his eyes. He knew what she was about to say. She sat up and stared at the plain wooden door. Then she looked at the other mage.</p>
<p>“Pisces?”</p>
<p>“Yes, oh Captain of mine?”</p>
<p>“Get your skeletons to grab whatever weapons they can and break down that damn door.”</p>
<p>“It would be my pleasure.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An hour later, the door fell in. It wasn’t because the wood had been shattered by the constant hammering on it, or that the four adventurers had cast any particular spell to break it. No, the reason the door broke was simple: the skeletons had chipped away at the stone around the hinges set in the wall until the masonry cracked, and the door obeyed the forces of gravity.</p>
<p>The four skeletons that had done all of the work stepped back, rusted blades in hand as three adventurers peeked into the opening, coughing as the small dust cloud that had been raised temporarily obscured all vision.</p>
<p>Pisces, Ceria, and Ksmvr stood behind the wall of skeletons, ready for anything. They were exhausted, hurt, and hungry, but all were sure this was the final barrier, and they were determined to be here. And they were all alive. The only incapacitated member of their team they’d left a few feet away, wrapped up in a blanket.</p>
<p>Yvlon lay on the ground, shuddering. She was safe, but not up to any further exploring for the moment. She was still gibbering a bit, but she had stopped assuming different personalities and better, she had regained bowel control. It had deserted her in a rather unfortunate way as she slowly came out of the effects of the [Insanity] spell.</p>
<p>Now the three adventurers tensed, waiting for the cloud to clear. They expected another trap, or maybe an antechamber, the beginning of another part of the hallway, but then the dust cleared and they saw the light.</p>
<p>It wasn’t sunlight, or artificial light, but rather, the golden glow as the light from outside touched something in the room and made it shimmer. Ceria lowered her skeletal hand and breathed out. Slowly.</p>
<p>“Oh dead gods.”</p>
<p>The fallen door had revealed only a small chamber at the end of all these deadly traps. It was a small room. Yes, a small room, but one filled with one thing. The thing all adventurers dreamed of.</p>
<p>Treasure.</p>
<p>Pisces and Ceria gaped in wonder, their eyes nearly popping out of their heads. Peeking around one of the motionless skeletons, Ksmvr nodded in approval.</p>
<p>“I see quite a number of swords. This is considered good, correct?”</p>
<p>In truth, the room couldn’t have been more than twenty feet across, and it was certainly narrower than it was long. It was the storage closet of treasure vaults, but the quality set it apart. Ceria and Pisces could see it in the glimmering aura that manifested itself the instant they laid eyes on the treasure.</p>
<p>“Look at it!”</p>
<p>Ceria half-screamed as she pointed. The room was small, but it had a rack of weapons that first caught the eye. Glimmering weapons and metal that didn’t look like any ore Ceria had ever seen before hung in the form of swords, daggers, even a battleaxe.</p>
<p>On the other wall a bookshelf full of clearly magical tomes stood, a treasure in itself. A mage’s library. But that wasn’t all. Glittering gold coins and gems occupied the back of the treasure room glowing and glimmering in the adventurer’s light. But what drew Ceria’s attention was the small desk, the magical tome and small bag sitting next to it, and the staff almost casually propped up against the wall.</p>
<p>Any other eye might have been drawn to the gold, or like Ksmvr to the artifacts in the forms of weaponry. But both mages only had eyes for the staff. They saw what others could not; the magic that emanated from the object like a beacon.</p>
<p>“The staff. I can’t believe it! Can you see the aura, Springwalker? Can you <em>see</em> the power in it?”</p>
<p>“I can! I can! It radiates—just look, Ksmvr!”</p>
<p>“I see swords. Where is the staff?”</p>
<p>It was actually a staff in two parts. Twisted metal—or was it stone?—snaked upwards, dividing, becoming thin tendrils of metal which eventually tapered off into nothing. A foot of space, and then the tendrils reappeared, moving in the opposite direction, reaching the top of the staff which was set with a huge aquamarine gemstone. The two pieces of the staff were perfectly connected, as if there was steel in the place of air.</p>
<p>“It even <em>looks </em>magical. Ancestors, look at it.”</p>
<p>“I have to touch it.”</p>
<p>Pisces breathed the words and Ceria thought the exact same thing. Ksmvr looked doubtfully around the room.</p>
<p>“Should we check for traps first?”</p>
<p>Neither mage heard him. They ran forwards, jostling each other. Ksmvr walked after them, staring around.</p>
<p>“I would like to try one of the swords. Do you think that would be acceptable?”</p>
<p>Pisces and Ceria ignored Ksmvr. They practically fought each other to be the first into the room, both reaching for the staff.</p>
<p>“Intruders.”</p>
<p>The voice was soft, but full of malice. Both Pisces and Ceria froze, hands reaching for the staff. They looked around, and saw something appearing in the center of the room.</p>
<p>Flames licked into being, and then coalesced. Air became fire, and the fire itself knitted together to become a solid thing, a shape, a figure made out of the white-hot flames. A man, or what looked vaguely like a man, stepped out of the air and stared at Pisces, Ceria, and Ksmvr.</p>
<p>“You are trespassing in the personal sanctuary of Warmage Thresk. Identify yourselves or be destroyed.”</p>
<p>“Oh no.”</p>
<p>Ceria breathed the words, her heart tight in her chest. They’d forgotten. In their haste, they’d forgotten the golden rule of adventuring. Never let your guard down at the end. That’s when the worst trap starts.</p>
<p>The fiery creation looked at her, eyes burning blue in its formless face.</p>
<p>“Who are you? Why do you enter this place? Answer, or I will burn you asunder.”</p>
<p>Something was burning in the center of its chest. A jewel? Ceria squinted at it as Pisces stammered a reply.</p>
<p>“We are ah, <em>Wistram</em> mages, here to consult with Warmage Thresk on a matter of great importance. We apologize if we are disturbing—”</p>
<p>“Lies.”</p>
<p>The fiery eyes burned. The construct opened a mouth and showed them insides full of red flames that burned against his incendiary white-hot exterior.</p>
<p>“No one may enter this place save for Warmage Thresk or those of his blood. You are thieves. You will be burnt to ash.”</p>
<p>He raised a hand and extended it towards the three. All at once, the heat in the room grew until it was practically an inferno by itself. Ceria shouted at the same time Pisces did. Both mages extended their palms out.</p>
<p>“[Frozen Wind]!”</p>
<p>The spell blew freezing cold air towards the apparition for a moment. Just for a moment, that was all. It barely halted the rising temperature of the room, but it gave the two mages and Ksmvr the moment they needed to dash out of the room before they were cooked in their skins. Ceria gasped as she ran down the corridor; her skin felt <em>burnt </em>from the second they’d been in the room.</p>
<p>“Pisces! Use the skeletons!”</p>
<p>“Right. Defend me!”</p>
<p>He called out to the skeletons as the three adventurers rushed past them. The skeletons charged the fiery being—and immediately turned to ash as they got too close. Ceria didn’t even bother to swear; she just pumped her arms and legs faster.</p>
<p>“[Frozen Wind] had no effect!”</p>
<p>She screamed at Pisces. He shouted back, face pale.</p>
<p>“I know! That thing’s way too powerful! We have to retreat!”</p>
<p>“<em>There is no escape!</em>”</p>
<p>Flames burst out of the ground in front of them. Pisces, Ceria, and Ksmvr skidded to a halt as the fire wall blocked off their exit. This was no ordinary [Fire Wall] spell either; the flames were not just red or orange, but white-hot like the construct, and the stone <em>cracked</em> and melted where the fire touched.</p>
<p>“Dead gods.”</p>
<p>They turned and saw the apparition of flames. It was walking towards them, slowly, nonchalantly, as if it had all the time in the world. Ceria grabbed Pisces’s arm.</p>
<p>“Do you have any spells you can use?”</p>
<p>“Me? You’re the ice specialist! You do something about it!”</p>
<p>Ceria gulped. The hallway was large enough to dodge the flaming being, but he was walking faster now. He was reaching out to them, and a sword of blue flames grew in his hands.</p>
<p>“Ksmvr, Pisces! Distract it!”</p>
<p>“<em>Me?</em>”</p>
<p>“Acknowledged.”</p>
<p>Pisces gaped at her. But Ceria was backing up. Ksmvr ran forwards and slashed at the monster—his sword melted before he got close and he stumbled away, <em>keening</em> in distress. Just the proximity to the fiery being had cracked his carapace with the heat.</p>
<p>“Pisces!”</p>
<p>He gulped but ran towards the fiery being. It swung the sword at him, but Pisces took a step and his form <em>blurred. </em>He dashed around the construct, nimbly avoiding it as it swung twice more.</p>
<p>[Flash Step]. It was one of Pisces’ old spells, and Ceria was relieved to see he hadn’t forgotten how to use it. Pisces danced back, keeping a very large distance away from the fiery being as he let it approach him. He dodged and wove back and forth with nimble steps, careful not to let it corner him in the corridor.</p>
<p>“A spell would greatly be appreciated, Springwalker!”</p>
<p>Ceria didn’t even bother to reply. She was focusing, trying to call upon all the mana she had left for an attack.</p>
<p>Her best spell was [Ice Spike], but if she concentrated, Ceria could fire one shot from all five fingers. She drew mana into her skeletal hand, calling on all her reserves.</p>
<p>The apparition lunged forwards, and Ceria heard Pisces scream. The fiery blade hadn’t touched him, but the creation had moved too close and Pisces had been burned by the heat emanating from the being. He leapt away with the [Flash Step] spell and then collapsed against a wall, moaning. Tendrils of smoke rose from his burnt side and hundreds of blisters appeared like magic on his arms and legs.</p>
<p>“You will be burnt.”</p>
<p>The construct walked forwards, blue eyes burning. Ceria shouted.</p>
<p>“Turn and face <em>me,</em> you damn Golem!”</p>
<p>It turned. There was no fear in the construct’s eyes as it saw Ceria approaching. It raised its sword and lowered itself to charge, but Ceria didn’t give it time to do so. She raised her hand and shouted.</p>
<p>“[Ice Spike]!”</p>
<p>Five wicked shards of ice, each as long as Ceria’s arm burst from her hand, shooting out like ballista bolts at the fiery apparition. The ice flew towards the flaming creature, struck his outer flames, and <em>screamed</em> as the ice evaporated into steam instantly. The fiery construct blinked once, his flames not even dampened by the spell.</p>
<p>“Oh Ancestors.”</p>
<p>Ceria backed away from him. The construct advanced, sword at its side. It had no fear of her, not even wariness.</p>
<p>“You will perish.”</p>
<p>“Not her. Turn and face me first!”</p>
<p>This shout came from the side. Ceria heard what almost sounded like a sigh coming from the fiery thing, and then it turned. Yvlon stood with her shield and sword in hand, facing the apparition fearlessly.</p>
<p>“Face me, thing. I will not run from you.”</p>
<p>Ceria’s heart leapt in her chest, but her mouth opened to shout a warning as she scrambled backwards, away from the fiery being.</p>
<p>“Don’t block its flames! It’ll burn through your armor!”</p>
<p>Yvlon heard the warning as the creation hurled white flames at her. She dropped her shield and rolled. The fire missed her, but from the way Yvlon cried out, Ceria knew she had to have felt the intense heat of the fire.</p>
<p>“There’s no way to block against it!”</p>
<p>“The door.”</p>
<p>Pisces moaned and Ceria saw that he and Ksmvr had pulled themselves into the small room. The construct froze, and then he seemed to grow larger, as if in rage.</p>
<p>“No one may enter the treasury.”</p>
<p>“Then come and stop us if you can!”</p>
<p>Pisces shouted, and the guardian obliged. He hurled more fire, but this time Ksmvr and Yvlon pulled the door up, the door that had proved unbreakable, and blocked the fire. The white flames dissipated as they struck the innocuous wood, and the guardian <em>hissed.</em></p>
<p>It was distracted, and ignoring Ceria for the moment. But she was caught between a hot place and the wall of flames it had created. She glanced at them as she stared at the guardian. Nowhere to run. But she wasn’t about to abandon her friends.</p>
<p>Think. The construct had to be powered by something. No spell could ever power such a being for long, not without the mage supplying mana. Then where was its power source?</p>
<p>The thing she’d spotted in the chest. Ceria squinted as the construct advanced. Was it—yes there it was! She saw something glowing in the chest. Some sort of mana stone. But how could she strike it?</p>
<p>The construct hurled fire, but Yvlon ducked behind the wooden door she was using like a shield. She darted out, baiting the construct as it swung at her, but dove backwards again. She couldn’t get near enough to strike, not that her sword would have hurt the guardian, but she was occupying it as it advanced. In a few seconds though, they would be cornered.</p>
<p>If only they could bypass the flames—</p>
<p>“Use the door!”</p>
<p>Ceria screamed at the others. The guardian turned its head, but she pointed, heedless of the danger.</p>
<p>“There’s a gem in its chest! Use the door and smash it!”</p>
<p>“Got it!”</p>
<p>The three adventurers backed away from the construct, holding the door as a shield in front of them. It hesitated, aware of the power of the door to mitigate its flames.</p>
<p>“You will not stop—”</p>
<p>All three Horns of Hammerad shouted as they rushed towards the construct, pushing the door forwards like a huge shield. At the last moment, before they got too close and were burnt alive, they let go of the door. Ksmvr kicked it forwards, and the massive wooden section of wood fell slowly towards the flaming guardian.</p>
<p>The fiery being took one look at the falling door—</p>
<p>And dodged. He stepped swiftly to one side, avoiding it. Not swiftly enough; the door crushed his left side and the guardian <em>howled</em> in what sounded like true agony. But he was not dead. Ceria saw the gemstone in his chest, a pulsating emerald stone the size of her fist. But already the flames were swirling around it, growing, rebuilding his body.</p>
<p>“For Byres and honor!”</p>
<p>Yvlon shouted as she charged forwards. Ceria saw Ksmvr and Pisces trying to drag her back, but the armored woman ran at the fiery guardian. It raised its flaming sword, but she cut through it. Her own silvery sword was mere metal, but for a brief second before it evaporated, the metal was still strong. And it struck the gem at the construct’s source.</p>
<p>“<em>Aaah!</em>”</p>
<p>Ceria heard Yvlon’s scream first, right above the <em>crack</em> of the gem breaking.</p>
<p>She howled as her silver armor glowed red. The sword melted as it dropped from her hands and she stumbled away. Her silver armor was <em>melting </em>over her hands, making the young woman scream.</p>
<p>And the construct howled too. It reached for the gem, and then it faltered. The flames in its eyes went out. It tried to step towards Ceria, stumbled. Then it looked up at her and roared.</p>
<p>“If the secret of this place cannot be protected, then everything will be destroyed. And you will perish with it!”</p>
<p>It stood up, and stumbled back into the treasury room. Ceria shouted.</p>
<p>“<em>No!</em>”</p>
<p>But it was too late. The construct fell to the ground, and the white hot flames began to spread. It was engulfing the room! The flames were spreading, reaching outwards into the corridor. The guardian was trying to burn the treasure—and the Horns of Hammerad with it.</p>
<p>“Get away, everyone! We have to run!”</p>
<p>Pisces and Ksmvr ran away from the intense heat, shouting in pain. They grabbed Yvlon, who was still clawing at her smoking arms, and pulled her towards Ceria. She turned to run—</p>
<p>And saw the white-hot flames, still burning, a solid wall blocking their escape. The flames had diminished somewhat, but they were still so hot that Ceria knew touching them would sear her to the bone in seconds.</p>
<p>Pisces and Ksmvr stopped beside her, burnt and smoking. They stared in horror at the flames blocking the entrance, and then at the fire slowly engulfing the treasury room, making its way down the corridor towards them.</p>
<p>“What do we do, Captain? A spell?”</p>
<p>“One of the walls?”</p>
<p>“We can’t tunnel through that!”</p>
<p>“The trap below!”</p>
<p>Pisces shouted, and Ceria looked. Yes, there! The opening in the floor was still visible. She grabbed Yvlon’s legs—the woman couldn’t even move as she still screamed, and all three adventurers ran towards it.</p>
<p>Ceria nearly fell off the bone staircase, but Ksmvr caught her and they rushed down the stairs, already feeling the heat overhead. Ksmvr and Pisces laid Yvlon on the floor and she screamed again, trying to pull her melted armor off. But the metal had <em>fused</em>, and her arms were still smoking. Ceria caught her breath and reached for a potion, but Ksmvr was faster. He poured it over her arms and into her mouth while Pisces poured the last of their water over Yvlon’s arms. Steam rose and she stopped thrashing.</p>
<p>She was alive, for now. Ceria diverted her attention upwards. She could still sense the heat, and she knew the flames were spreading. And that fire—it was magical flames, of a Tier she’d never seen before. It would burn away everything upstairs. The treasure, the swords—everything.</p>
<p>“No, no, <em>no!</em> We were so close! It can’t end like this!”</p>
<p>Ceria shouted in despair, but she knew better than to go up. Ksmvr reached for her, but Ceria knocked his hand away. She hammered the ground as she screamed in desperation.</p>
<p>“It won’t end.”</p>
<p>Pisces’ voice made Ceria look up. The mage was standing, robes burnt, skin blistered, but determined. A fierce look was in his eyes and he raised both arms up, his voice growing deeper.</p>
<p>“<em>Arise! Arise and heed my call! Go into the depths of flame and bring me a ransom of gold and magic! Go now, treasure seekers! Go, fallen comrades!</em>”</p>
<p>The room trembled. Every bone in the room—from the staircases to the bones Pisces had left untouched, began to <em>shift</em> and come together. Skeletons rose up, and began running the instant they were formed, before they were even fully formed. Ceria stared as they dashed up the staircase of bone. Up.</p>
<p>She knew what they had to be doing. The skeletons dashed into the room and snatched up burning objects, heedless of the flames that <em>cracked</em> their very bones. Over half fell before they could return, their bones catching fire and literally disintegrating from the heat.</p>
<p>But some—yes, some made it out of the room, and what they took was scooped up by other bony hands, brought back. Burning skeletons fell down from above and Ceria and Ksmvr shielded their faces as burning bone fragments crashed to the ground around them. More skeletons ran up, and Pisces shouted, his hands pointed up as sweat poured from his brow. He gasped, pointing, as more skeletons emerged, even more burnt than before, falling into the pit.</p>
<p>And then the fire grew more intense, and not a single skeleton returned. Ceria saw the last burst into flames even as he climbed up into the tunnel above, and Pisces collapsed on the ground. Ceria rushed over to him and found the mage breathing hoarsely.</p>
<p>“The heat—”</p>
<p>It was growing hot. So hot. Ceria lay down on the cool stone and saw Ksmvr cradling Yvlon. Her arms—didn’t look right. Melted silver intertwined with flesh, and she was unconscious. Pisces lay on the ground next to the burnt bone. Slowly, Ceria looked around.</p>
<p>Scattered objects. Burnt things, barely recognizable. A cracked sword, blackened by soot. A buckler almost cut in half.</p>
<p>Worthless things. And no staff. Ceria despaired, and felt her eyes stinging. If she had water in her to cry, she might have. But then she saw a skeletal hand, holding something. Ceria crawled over to it, and saw a burnt tome.</p>
<p>A book. Its cover was gone, and half the pages. Ceria brushed aside white ash and saw a page and glowing symbols. She clutched it to her, holding it dearly as the heat grew even worse, and air became a luxury, then a memory.</p>
<p>Slowly, Ksmvr collapsed to the ground, still holding Yvlon. Pisces didn’t move, and the stairway of bone fell to the ground. Ceria didn’t even look up as something struck her back. She couldn’t. She just held the book and breathed in. Out. In. Out. In—</p>
<p>It was so hot.</p>

		<p>She woke up quietly, without screaming. Ceria opened her eyes and sat up. She was in pain, but she didn’t cry out. She just took a deep, wavering breath in the silence of the pit and knew she was alive.</p>
<p>Her skin felt burnt. Not just burnt; <em>damaged.</em> The heat from above had cooked her like an egg. But she was still alive, so it was clear that the magical flames from above hadn’t managed to spread to below.</p>
<p>The half-Elf sighed, and felt something move on her chest. She looked down and saw the book. Part of it was white ash that fell away as she lifted it up. But the other half—</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>It was magical. The page that lay exposed under the dust shone, the intricate, spider-web writing that made up the magical spells glowing like saffron under her gaze. Ceria breathed lightly and the ash fell away. She looked at the spell and felt the magic reach out to her, whispering. For a second Ceria just looked at the third of the spellbook and believed in magic, believed in legends and dreams and even heroes. Then she put the book down and looked for her friends.</p>
<p>“[Light].”</p>
<p>The shimmering azure orb cast into light the fragments of scorched bone, the black tar-like substance on the walls, and the armored young woman sitting cross-legged in the center of the destruction. Yvlon sat silently, head bowed, staring in quiet contemplation at her arms. Her golden hair shone slightly, but the reflection off the melted silver of her arms shone even brighter. It flowed, like an ocean of metal.</p>
<p>“Yvlon.”</p>
<p>The other woman didn’t look up as Ceria staggered over. She just lifted her arms—with effort.</p>
<p>“It’s fused to my skin, Ceria. I can feel it. I could take off the rest of my armor but this—this isn’t so easy to undo.”</p>
<p>She had indeed taken off the rest of her plate armor. It lay scattered around her, badly deformed, parts melted together such that Yvlon had had to take off the entire section at once. But the metal on her arms remained. Ceria caught her breath as she saw how badly the metal had melted. It was twisted, warped, and clung to Yvlon’s arms like—</p>
<p>“We can cut it off. Even if we have to heal some of it afterwards—”</p>
<p>“Some will come off. But the rest—it feels deep, Ceria.”</p>
<p>Yvlon shook her head. Her arms moved as she—slowly—flexed them. Ceria saw breaks along the elbows and wrist sections, enough for Yvlon to move her arms. But the metal was clearly anchored to Yvlon’s flesh.</p>
<p>“We’ll get it off. We just need to get back to the city.”</p>
<p>Yvlon nodded slowly. She smiled, only a trace of bitterness in her eyes.</p>
<p>“I always wondered how Dullahans lived. I guess I’ll learn a bit of what it’s like.”</p>
<p>“I—”</p>
<p>There was nothing to say. Ceria bent down and clasped Yvlon’s shoulder. After a moment, she felt a cold, hard hand grasp hers.</p>
<p>“You saved us all. You slew a being made of pure flame with a sword. You’d be a hero among adventurers just for that.”</p>
<p>“Father would be proud.”</p>
<p>The Human woman laughed. Ceria forced her lips to move, smiled. Then she looked around.</p>
<p>“Pisces and Ksmvr?”</p>
<p>“Over there. Pisces looks worst off—I’d have woken you, but I thought it was better if you rested.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded and brushed at her sooty hair. She staggered a bit—she felt empty.</p>
<p>“How long was I out?”</p>
<p>“I was only up for the last twenty minutes. Before that? It must be hours, at least. I can’t sense any heat from above.”</p>
<p>“True.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded, and then walked over to Pisces and Ksmvr. The two were lying not far from each other. And of the two, Pisces was clearly worse-off. The mage had vomit staining his lips and he had gotten some of it on himself. He was pale and shivering, and Ceria knew he had to be suffering. She pulled out a bottle from her belt. It was still intact. The thick glass had protected the mana potion.</p>
<p>Carefully, Ceria poured the maroon liquid over Pisces, ignoring his reactions. It didn’t matter too much if he drank it; right now his body was a void of mana, and he would absorb it from the concentrated liquid to recover.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Pisces sat up, gasping. The noise woke up Ksmvr as well. The two sat up; Ksmvr dribbled a bit of green from his mouth, but wiped it away. Ceria wasn’t sure if that was blood or something worse. No one was in good shape at the moment.</p>
<p>“Pisces, are you okay?”</p>
<p>“I—”</p>
<p>The mage’s face was pale. He dry-heaved a bit, and then wiped at his mouth. He regarded the stains on his robe and shuddered before looking up at Ceria.</p>
<p>“Mana potion?”</p>
<p>She nodded. Ksmvr staggered upright and saluted Ceria weakly.</p>
<p>“Captain.”</p>
<p>“Take it easy, Ksmvr.”</p>
<p>“I will do so. Is comrade Pisces alright?”</p>
<p>“I think so, but he was insane. You know that, right, Pisces? You reanimated what, over thirty skeletons in a ten minute period? You’re lucky you didn’t start bleeding in the brain or damage yourself worse.”</p>
<p>“I am a better [Necromancer] than I am a [Mage] by far.”</p>
<p>That was all Pisces said, which meant he pretty much agreed with Ceria’s statement. He looked around the pit full of bone fragments and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>“…Did we manage to save <em>anything?</em>”</p>
<p>“I found part of a spell book. Besides that, I don’t know. Yvlon’s not in a good way.”</p>
<p>The other two adventurers followed Ceria over to Yvlon. She looked up and nodded at them. Pisces stared at her arms openly, while Ksmvr looked at them and around the room.</p>
<p>“What should we do now, Captain Ceria? Should we begin collecting valuable items? I still have the pack you gave me.”</p>
<p>“I—”</p>
<p>Ceria just shook her head. She could barely stand, and she saw Pisces was swaying on his feet.</p>
<p>“Ten minutes. Let’s just…”</p>
<p>She sat down wearily, and then had to lie down. Pisces collapsed back onto the ground; Ksmvr stayed on his feet and began to wander the pit, picking up burnt objects. Yvlon went back to staring at her arms.</p>
<p>It took a while for Ceria to feel strong enough to get back up. When she did, she just felt like lying down again. But they had to move.</p>
<p>“Okay. Pisces, you’re our only ticket out of this pit. Can you make another staircase?”</p>
<p>The [Mage] looked up tiredly at the small gap high overhead.</p>
<p>“I can try.”</p>
<p>It was a mark of his exhaustion that he didn’t brag, and Ceria knew it. She helped him up.</p>
<p>“Do it slowly. Piece by piece. You don’t have to complete it in one go.”</p>
<p>He nodded. Ceria turned to Ksmvr.</p>
<p>“While Pisces is working, let’s get some of the stuff that fell into the pit gathered up. Most of it looks burned, but they’re all highly magical artifacts. Put anything you can find over here, okay Ksmvr?”</p>
<p>The Antinium had already accumulated a few burnt objects. He gently edged them closer to Yvlon, but the other woman was standing up. She moved her arms stiffly, and then nodded.</p>
<p>“I’ll help too.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to, Yvlon—”</p>
<p>“I can do it. I need to move.”</p>
<p>She began moving around the edge of the pit. Ceria hesitated, and then got to work as well. The first thing she did was pick up the spellbook. The magic words glimmered as she put the book in her pack. Then she began hunting for anything that had survived the flames.</p>
<p>“Burnt sword here. Looks cracked. But it’s still magical; I can feel it.”</p>
<p>“Are such objects repairable, Captain?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea. And I don’t even know what these things do, so handle them carefully, alright?”</p>
<p>“I will do so.”</p>
<p>Ceria placed the sword on the ground next to a pack. She stared at it blankly until she remembered it was the adventurer’s pack she’d found. What could be inside there?</p>
<p>Whatever it was, it would have to wait until later. Some adventurers trapped their belongings in case they were stolen, and Ceria wanted to risk nothing. She looked at Pisces, and saw he was beginning to build the bridge out of the burnt bones again.</p>
<p>This time, the construction process was painfully slow. Ceria could see Pisces grimacing as bones slowly flew into the air. He could only manage about eight at a time. But he was getting the job done, and he looked determined not to quit.</p>
<p>It was a different side of him than Ceria had seen, and once again it reminded her of the past. She paused as she sorted through a few bones next to Pisces.</p>
<p>“That was some final guardian, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded, not taking his eyes off his work.</p>
<p>“It was a formidable enemy. I regret that neither you nor I had the forethought to check for traps at the last moment.”</p>
<p>She nodded, biting her lip.</p>
<p>“Although if the mage was any good, he would have set the summoning spell to activate if we checked the magic, just like the door.”</p>
<p>“True.”</p>
<p>Silence. Ceria tossed a long bone up and watched it float upwards.</p>
<p>“Did it remind you of anything? The fire construct, I mean.”</p>
<p>“Are you referring to the Golems of Wistram? That is a natural comparison, but unfair. This…creature was clearly meant to be summoned for short periods rather than act as a permanent servant. True, it was far less intelligent than Cognita. It was simply a guardian, meant to kill.”</p>
<p>“It was good enough at that. I just wonder…how’d it catch you? You’re better than that, or you should be.”</p>
<p>The young man stopped in his work. He lowered his hands and stared at Ceria. His eyes were cold.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>“Exactly what I said. Don’t get offended, Pisces.”</p>
<p>“I find that a difficult proposition given your last statement.”</p>
<p>“I’m just remembering how you used to be. And if you’ll remember, you <em>were </em>better than this, once.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure I have no recollection of such martial prowess.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be a prat. I’m not trying to—”</p>
<p>Ceria broke off. She turned her head.</p>
<p>“Ah, Ksmvr? Do you need something?”</p>
<p>The Antinium nodded. He was standing a few feet away from the two adventurers, making no effort to conceal his eavesdropping. He stared fixedly at Ceria and Pisces.</p>
<p>“I would like to stay and observe the act of chastisement so I may learn to do it myself in a command situation.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure that’s such a—”</p>
<p>“No, no. Let the Antinium stay.”</p>
<p>Pisces folded his arms, looking angry. He snapped at Ceria.</p>
<p>“By all means, Springwalker. Say your piece.”</p>
<p>She took a breath. This wasn’t the time for it. But she couldn’t stop now. Calmly, she spoke, looking Pisces in the eye.</p>
<p>“In the battle against that fire thing, I saw you using [Flash Step], but you got caught, Pisces. When we were students together you could have danced around that construct for days without letting it get near you.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>Ceria spread her hands.</p>
<p>“And that’s all. I’m just making an observation.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“Don’t get offended. I’m not lecturing you, or complaining. Your quick thinking saved us, and you more than pulled your weight. We would have been dead without your help, and without your skeletons we wouldn’t have even found the tunnel. I’m just worried about what you’ve lost.”</p>
<p>The [Mage] considered this. He lost some of the hostility in his stance and uncrossed his arms.</p>
<p>“I see. Well, I am relieved to know you hold some part of me in high esteem. But I’m afraid I have no answer for you. I have simply…lost my touch as it were.”</p>
<p>“That’s all?”</p>
<p>“What do you want me to say, Springwalker? I have grown lax, it’s true. I don’t exactly duel other mages in the corridors anymore, and have little need for fencing.”</p>
<p>“Maybe not as a [Necromancer]. But Pisces the adventurer would be even more of an asset if he had his old skills back. I’m not saying you have to—I’m just saying that I admired that part of you.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Ceria and Pisces stared at each other for a bit longer. Ksmvr stared at both of them, looking disappointed.</p>
<p>“Will there be no exchange of blows? No physical confrontation?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“I do not believe that will be necessary.”</p>
<p>“I see. Well then, I shall go back to work.”</p>
<p>After a few seconds, so did Ceria and Pisces. And after a few more minutes, they had a small pile of what might be called loot by an optimist, and a stairway made of bones.</p>
<p>This one was thinner, Ceria noticed as she gazed upwards. It was no less sturdy, but Pisces had clearly taxed himself creating it. The mage sat on the ground next to Yvlon as the two rested for a moment. They were exhausted. So were Ceria and Ksmvr, but they were in far better shape by comparison.</p>
<p>“We’ll go up, Ksmvr and I. I think the fire thing’s dead—if it’s not we’ll come running down. But we’ll haul up all this…stuff. You two just rest.”</p>
<p>They nodded, and Ceria seized the sword, her pack, and Pisces’ pack before climbing the stairs. Her legs felt wobbly, but she was determined not to slip or fall.</p>
<p>At last, Ceria reached the top. She pulled herself up&nbsp; over the ledge of burnt and melted stone, relieved it was no longer hot to the touch. She stood up and looked around.</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>Everything was black and melted. The walls, the ceiling—everything had warped, and the white-hot flames had left sooty reminders where it had burned. It almost felt like Ceria was still back in the pit.</p>
<p>But then she looked in the treasure room, what had been the treasure room, and felt her heart break. It was completely ruined. There was nothing left of the vision she had seen first entering. Nothing at all.</p>
<p>The bookshelf had been turned to ash. The weapons had melted, at least, that was what Ceria could guess. The entire room was almost one solid color, that of charcoal black. Of a certainty, there were no magical weapons left, no books full of spells. Where the gold had been there was only a misshapen dark mass, and there was no staff.</p>
<p>It had been burnt away. Ceria felt her eyes sting as she gazed at the place where it had been, but she couldn’t even find the emotion to weep right now. She had wounded friends down below—there was no time for self-recriminations.</p>
<p>“Even so. What a waste.”</p>
<p>Ceria stared at the pile of burnt wood that had been the desk. Ksmvr walked into the room and poked around the destroyed bits. He paused as he kicked at a sooty mass and looked at Ceria.</p>
<p>“There is gold underneath the ash, Captain Ceria.”</p>
<p>“<em>Gold?</em>”</p>
<p>“And gemstones. They hav melted into the gold.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr pointed as Ceria practically dashed over. She saw a huge, melted mass of what first appeared to be scorched rock. But underneath the layer of blackness was a familiar dull gleam.</p>
<p>“Dead gods. It <em>is</em> gold!”</p>
<p>The treasure she had seen in the back of the room had been consumed by the fire as well. But unlike the other materials in the room, gold was still gold no matter what shape it took. Ceria tried to prize the gold free, and found that it had become one solid mass that had stuck to the floor.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to dig it up. But this—”</p>
<p>“I assume this is a good thing.”</p>
<p>“Very good.”</p>
<p>Ceria’s heart beat faster. The gold coins she and the others had so carefully used to buy their supplies—how many coins would this lump of fused metal make? She couldn’t imagine, especially because she knew the gold coins traded across the world weren’t pure gold. This probably was.</p>
<p>“Let’s get Pisces and Yvlon. They have to see this.”</p>
<p>As they went to leave the room, Ceria found something else as her foot landed in a pile of ash. She saw a flash of brown and snatched up a small bag, drawstrings tightly fastened. Ksmvr peered at it as Ceria lifted it up.</p>
<p>“What the…?”</p>
<p>“It is a bag, Captain.”</p>
<p>Ceria eyed Ksmvr. He ducked his head and shut up. She stared at the small satchel and remembered it, vaguely. It had been on the desk next to the staff…</p>
<p>“It’s not even burnt.”</p>
<p>“It is clearly magical. Should we open it and see what it contains?”</p>
<p>It had to be a bag of holding. It probably held…Ceria’s mind spun at the implications. But her internal warning bells all went off at the thought of opening it.</p>
<p>“No. It might be trapped. We’ll take it with us, but no one opens it or even drops it, okay?”</p>
<p>“I understand. Let us find the others and convey this good news.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr and Ceria made three trips up and down the ivory staircase, twice to haul up the burnt remains of the treasure, and then to help Yvlon and Pisces make their way up. And after the two had gotten over their initial dismay and relief at the treasure obtained, they made a proper survey of what they’d found.</p>
<p>“This sword is clearly magical. I wouldn’t risk using it in combat, but perhaps it could be repaired?”</p>
<p>Pisces murmured to the others as he lifted up the broken sword. The pommel had cracked while the actual blade looked only scorched, but that could well have been part of the spell matrices, and no one dared to separate it.</p>
<p>“A cracked shield. Not good. Can we still use it?”</p>
<p>Yvlon showed the buckler to Ceria. She nodded as she stared at the small bag and the adventurers’ pack, the only two wholly unburned objects.</p>
<p>“It’s magical too. We have to try.”</p>
<p>“We have quite a bit of gold as well.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr had helped lever up the metal and gems and then saw the pieces into manageable chunks. Now he was attempting to cram as many pieces as possible into their packs. Ceria eyed one bulging rucksack. She doubted <em>she </em>could carry the extremely dense gold, tired as she was. Yvlon and Pisces?</p>
<p>It was a hard thing to say out loud, but in one respect, their adventure wasn’t over yet. Ceria didn’t beat about the bush as Ksmvr awkwardly tied the weapons—sword, buckler, dagger, and another sword, of which only the blade remained—into a bundle to be carried.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to get back to a city, everyone. I know we’re tired, but we’ve got practically no rations and we’re sitting ducks out here. Yvlon’s injured and her armor’s gone—”</p>
<p>“As is my sword.”</p>
<p>“—Pisces is out of mana, I’m nearly tapped, and Ksmvr is going to have to carry most of the treasure.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr looked up.</p>
<p>“I am? Hm.”</p>
<p>“I hate to say it, but you’re the strongest of us and no one else can bear the load. Do you think you can handle it?”</p>
<p>She didn’t want to suggest burying the treasure. It was a risky move if people got wind of their haul and decided to backtrack to find anything they’d left behind. But Ceria didn’t want to overburden the Antinium either. To her surprise, Ksmvr shook his head.</p>
<p>“It is no problem. I can drag all that we have collected if need be. I would have simply organized the distribution of weight differently if I had known I was going to be the sole carrier.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Pisces, still looking quite gray and weary, sat up slowly, groaning with what seemed to be genuine distress for once.</p>
<p>“I can summon—one or two undead aides. They can help lift—”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Yvlon interrupted Pisces. She shook her head and lifted one of the packs, stumbling slightly at the weight.</p>
<p>“No undead. We can carry it ourselves.”</p>
<p>She looked at Ceria, and the half-Elf nodded.</p>
<p>“You heard her. We’ll get back ourselves.”</p>
<p>“Where to? We’re far from all the cities.”</p>
<p>“But we’re nearest to…ah, Remendia I think. Once we hit the main road we can catch a ride.”</p>
<p>“If we don’t hit bandits.”</p>
<p>“Dead gods. Don’t speak like that, Pisces. Let’s just get—”</p>
<p>Yvlon took a few steps and stumbled. Instantly, Ksmvr and Ceria grabbed her shoulder before she could fall. The taller woman smiled gratefully at them. Pisces heaved himself up with a groan and picked up the smallest pack.</p>
<p>“If we must persist, let us do so with dignity. Onwards, then.”</p>
<p>He lurched forwards, ignoring the look the other three gave him. But he was right, and soon enough Ceria and Yvlon and Ksmvr were stumbling up, out of the tunnels, out of Albez. They had seen the dungeon and retrieved the treasure.</p>
<p>But none of them were smiling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Cold.”</p>
<p>Ceria gritted her teeth as she walked through the snow. Pisces sneezed; Yvlon made a face.</p>
<p>“How’re your arms, Yvlon?”</p>
<p>“Just the same as when you last asked, Ceria.”</p>
<p>“Sorry.”</p>
<p>“No—I apologize.”</p>
<p>“Got another spell in you, Springwalker?”</p>
<p>Pisces chattered as he stumbled forwards in the freezing drifts. Ceria grimaced, but made a flame in her palm, feeding it as much mana as possible. Yvlon and Pisces crowded around, warming their hands.</p>
<p>Somehow, after all their battles in the dungeon under Albez, the Horns of Hammerad had forgotten that it was, in fact, the middle of winter above. It had been a nasty surprise to all of them to emerge into a light snow shower, but at least it hadn’t been a blizzard.</p>
<p>Pisces sighed as his hands grew warmer, and Yvlon grunted. She was trying to warm the metal stuck to her arms, and Ceria knew she had to be coldest since the metal lost its warmth faster than bare skin.</p>
<p>“Sure we’re going the right way?”</p>
<p>“I think so. The mountains are that way—we’ve got to be close. Maybe it’s over that incline over there?”</p>
<p>“Damn snow makes everything invisible. I can’t even see the forests—just white.”</p>
<p>Yvlon grumbled, swearing out loud for one of the first times in Ceria’s hearing. Pisces grunted. He glanced over his shoulder and called out.</p>
<p>“Ksmvr! Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“I am…well…thank you…Comrade Pisces.”</p>
<p>The puffing, slightly out-of-breath reply was at odds with the way Ksmvr diligently kept his steady, unfaltering pace. He slowly trudged forwards, dragging the bulk of their goods along the ground. The one good thing the weather had given the Horns of Hammerad was that they’d been able to make a makeshift sled for Ksmvr to drag along.</p>
<p>“You sure you don’t need help?”</p>
<p>Ceria and Yvlon eyed the Antinium with some concern. He shook his head, although his voice was no less strained.</p>
<p>“I am…designed for heavy labor. I will not…let the team down.”</p>
<p>“You won’t. Just let us know, okay?”</p>
<p>“Affirmative.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr walked past the others, gaining a few feet before they stopped huddling around the fire and kept walking. He didn’t stop. He was like a machine, like any other member of his kind, Ceria supposed. But it was different with Ksmvr. He was working for the sake of his team, not the other Antinium. Somehow, that made him feel that much more valuable to the others.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving.”</p>
<p>Ceria let the flame fade from her hands and Pisces and Yvlon dropped their arms with a sigh. All three staggered slightly before the momentum kept them going. Ahead, Ksmvr slipped on a patch of snow but regained his footing and took another step forwards.</p>
<p>They were all reaching the end of their physical endurance. Ceria had already passed around the hard biscuit and dried meat in their packs—the only rations they had left—and now the only thing keeping the adventurers going was the thought of food and rest.</p>
<p>No one was smiling. No one really talked, except for Ceria, and only then to make sure no one else was freezing. The Horns of Hammerad moved in…if not depression, something reminiscent of it.</p>
<p>Yes, they had found treasure in Albez, among the ruins. Yes, they had gone through traps and against all odds survived. But what had they for their trouble?</p>
<p>One burned spellbook, some damaged magical artifacts practically leaking magic, a backpack full of dead adventurer’s gear, and a small bag that was almost definitely trapped with magic way above their ability to dispel. Oh, and nearly eighty pounds of gold and fused gemstones.</p>
<p>It was a win, and it would have been cause for celebration for over a week in the old Horns of Hammerad. But in Ceria’s weary mind, there was more than a bit of regret and failure she couldn’t shake.</p>
<p>She remembered the glimmering staff and the personal arms and equipment of a powerful mage of the past, one capable of creating magical traps and a summoned construct that could last for hundreds or thousands of years.</p>
<p>“But we’re alive.”</p>
<p>“What was that, Ceria?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>They weren’t a proper Silver-rank team, not yet. Individually they were all better than average, but together they still had their differences. But they’d come through their first adventure, their first <em>dungeon</em> alive and in once piece.</p>
<p>That had to count for something. It did count.</p>
<p>“There’s the city.”</p>
<p>Pisces called out as he crested the incline. Ceria raised her head and smiled in relief.</p>
<p>“Remendia?”</p>
<p>Yvlon peered at the city and shook her head.</p>
<p>“Nope. Too small. We must be at Ocre.”</p>
<p>“Close enough. It’s got walls and a gate. That’s all I want.”</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s get in there.”</p>
<p>“Should we plan out where we go once we get in the city? In case we get separated?”</p>
<p>Confused, Ceria looked at Yvlon.</p>
<p>“What? Why?”</p>
<p>The woman gave Ceria a weary grin.</p>
<p>“We’re entering&nbsp; the city with a fortune in gold and treasure, Ceria. If we don’t get this stuff under guard quick, it’ll be gone before we get to the market.”</p>
<p>Ceria muttered a half-Elven curse word involving flowers.</p>
<p>“I forgot that. You’re right. Ksmvr, Pisces, we’ve got to get the treasure to the Adventurer’s Guild the instant we get through the gates.”</p>
<p>“Will it be safe there?”</p>
<p>“Should be. And if it’s not, the Adventurer’s Guild has to compensate us. Just don’t stop, don’t drop the bags—Ksmvr, spread it out so we can all carry it—and don’t promise anyone anything, okay?”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded as Ksmvr began dividing the treasure. He grunted as he lifted his pack, but there was a smile on his face. The Antinium nodded.</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>“We will heed your instructions.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Ceria took a breath. She didn’t know what to say. Here they were, at the end of their quest and—well, what should she tell them? She was their Captain, even if they’d elected her in a second. But hadn’t it been that way with Calruz? He’d always made his team feel like they were a success, even after the hardest of missions. What had he said?</p>
<p>She couldn’t remember the words, but Ceria remembered the feeling. She called on that now, and looked the other Horns of Hammerad in the eye.</p>
<p>“Heads held high, everyone. It’s been a long journey, but we did it. We found treasure in Albez—probably the biggest haul in over a decade! If that’s not worth a bit of pride, I don’t know what is.”</p>
<p>She saw three pairs of eyes on her, and three people smiled. One, a young woman, grinned and grimaced in pain, but her eyes were steady. The young man with haunted eyes and an expression more used to sneering than honest emotion gave her a true smile now that reminded her of the past. And the Antinium opened his mandibles, his face foreign and to some, a face of nightmares. But he was smiling too.</p>
<p>Ceria pointed towards the walls of the city. The guards at the wall hadn’t spotted them yet; there was a bit of foot traffic navigating the frozen road into the city, but she was sure they would stand out the moment they got close. Gold had its own glitter.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be Humans crawling all over us when we get in, so let’s stick together. If you get lost, shout and we’ll be along. Don’t drop anything and remember, we’re adventurers. We stick together.”</p>
<p>She led them down the hill, towards the gates. Her legs were exhausted, but Ceria put more energy into them. They were here, safe! She smiled up at the guards on the walls, never happier to see a Human in her life. She heard a shout as they spotted the armed warriors approaching—not too warily—adventurers were a common sight. She raised a hand to wave up at them, waiting for them to notice the gold—</p>
<p>“<em>Antinium at the gates! We’re under attack!</em>”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Ceria heard the panicked shout and with a shock, realized the guards were raising their bows and calling the alarm. She shouted desperately and waved at them—it was just Ksmvr! How could they not tell he was alone and with them? But then she saw the arrows at the strings and screamed.</p>
<p>“Ksmvr! <em>Watch out!</em>”</p>
<p>The Antinium had been waving up at the wall, copying Ceria. As soon as he saw the bows he dropped his pack and tried to take cover in the snow. He dove out of the way as a rain of arrows thudded into the ground next to him. The Antinium stood back up and staggered as an arrow sprouted from his right shoulder.</p>
<p>“Stop! <em>Stop</em>, damn you!”</p>
<p>Ceria <em>shouted</em> up at the wall, but no one was listening. The [Guardsmen] were preparing another volley. She saw someone run past her and then saw Yvlon. The woman threw herself in front of Ksmvr, holding the remnant of her plate armor and her pack filled with the gold. She crouched in front of the Antinium as arrows rained down on them again. Her protection wasn’t perfect, but the hail of arrows mostly bounced off her pack and armor. Ksmvr <em>hissed</em> as an arrow struck his leg and another glanced off his lower back, but he didn’t move.</p>
<p>“<em>Cease fire!</em>”</p>
<p>This time Pisces took up the call. He raised his voice and then Ceria remembered she had magic. She touched her throat and then bellowed.</p>
<p>“<em>Stop shooting you damn Humans! We’re adventurers!</em>”</p>
<p>Her voice bounced off the walls and she heard confused shouting. The Humans lowered their bows for a second, and then someone who looked like an officer was running, pointing at them. Ceria and Pisces ran over to Yvlon, watching the [Guardsmen] warily. No more arrows flew down from the walls, and after a second, Ceria saw people rushing down the battlements.</p>
<p>Yvlon crouched beside Ksmvr, still shielding him. The Antinium was trying to get up and she was holding him down.</p>
<p>“Don’t move. They might loose another volley. Ksmvr, are you okay?”</p>
<p>“I am fine. Captain, permission to return fire?”</p>
<p>“Do you have a bow?”</p>
<p>“…Permission to throw things?”</p>
<p>“No. Just hold on.”</p>
<p>Ceria watched as the people on the wall shouted. Then, one of them stood up and raised a flag. It was white. Pisces snorted at it.</p>
<p>“Is that supposed to mean they surrender? Or that they’re not going to try and kill us?”</p>
<p>“Either one works for me. Oh look, now they’ve noticed the gold. They’re sending a delegation.”</p>
<p>Yvlon just sighed. She helped Ksmvr up. The Antinium grunted as he snapped the shaft of the arrow in his leg. The one in his shoulder he left alone as he hefted his pack.</p>
<p>“Adventurers! The [Guardsmen] are standing down! The gates are open!”</p>
<p>Someone was shouting from the walls. Ceria looked up and growled.</p>
<p>“That’s all they can say?”</p>
<p>She raised her skeletal hand and gave the [Guardsmen] on the wall an unmistakable gesture. Then she looked around. Pisces was giving the people clustered at the gates an evil eye. Yvlon was helping Ksmvr walk forwards, and the Antinium was dragging his pack. Everyone had the same grim expression on their face. She nodded.</p>
<p>“New plan. We go in and if anyone gets in our way, you have my full permission to hit them. Stick together, and until we get to the Adventurer’s Guild and log our claim, no one slows us down.”</p>
<p>There was indeed a group of anxious-looking people forming at the gates. Ceria scowled. Pisces rubbed at his face and spoke to no one in particular.</p>
<p>“I really hate this continent.”</p>
<p>“Humans.”</p>
<p>“I would like to not have this arrow in my leg.”</p>
<p>“Adventurer’s Guild and bed. And I will kick anyone who gets in our way.”</p>
<p>For once it looked like they all had something they could agree on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happened when adventurers came back from a dungeon? For all that the stories of adventurers returning with fame and fortune were told to every child, it was rare enough that no one had any structure to what came next.</p>
<p>But there was a certain rhythm to things. Assuming the adventurers were not being pursued by monsters or grievously injured—and assuming they came back successfully bearing treasure, not laden down with failure and regret—there was inevitably a lot of fuss.</p>
<p>It began at the walls. The [Guardsmen] on duty would always be the first to notice adventurers coming in, and there was a certain walk the triumphant had. Not to mention the glitter of gold. They would be the first to shout the news, and then it was just a matter of who was standing closest to the gates.</p>
<p>Everyone loved treasure. True, Drakes and Humans were known to love it most of all, but there wasn’t an adult or child who wouldn’t drop whatever they were doing and rush to see what wonders had been unearthed by the brave souls who had found some ancient tomb or lair.</p>
<p>Next would come the procession, as the adventurers made their way through a crowd only too willing to take their burdens off their shoulders—and run away with it. Depending on the efficiency of the local City Watch, the streets would be kept clear for the adventurers to make their way to their Guild. In the worst case scenario, the party of weary warriors would have to fight their way through a mob, fending off [Pickpockets] and even attacks with blade and spell.</p>
<p>And then would come the moment they arrived at their Guild, where the doors would be thrown open and the treasure displayed and sorted, and the adventurers would be able to rest, knowing their hard-won earnings were safely stored away and guarded by spell and lock. They would then either drink until they were unconscious, eat half a roasted pig, do both, or simply fall asleep there and then.</p>
<p>That was the way an adventurers’ return went. Events almost always transpired according to this formula, mainly because there was only a finite number of ways people bearing treasure and wealth beyond imagining were greeted. Shooting arrows at them was a first, and so the Horns of Hammerad entered the city in a rather different way than the standard.</p>
<p>“Move it!”</p>
<p>Ceria fired an [Ice Spike] spell over the heads of the first fawning delegation that came to greet them. The people screamed and ducked, which made progressing far easier. She and the other Horns of Hammerad marched through the streets, ignoring the voices that pressed around them.</p>
<p>“Honored adventurers, please excuse—”</p>
<p>“Is that an Antinium? Are they attacking?”</p>
<p>“You’re injured! Let us help—”</p>
<p>There were all too many hands reaching for the gold poking out of the bags the adventurers carried. Pisces snarled as a boy reached out for his pack.</p>
<p>“Touch my bag child, and I will reanimate your corpse just so I can <em>beat it to death again.</em>”</p>
<p>The boy fled, but there were many more to take his place. Yvlon shouldered people aside, face set.</p>
<p>“Make way! We’ve got wounded! Where’s the Adventurer’s Guild?”</p>
<p>Fortunately it wasn’t too far down the street. Ceria ignored the crowds and the questions. She threw fire on the ground and people scattered—Pisces blew cold air at people, making them retreat. Ksmvr had his own bubble of space.</p>
<p>“If anyone touches me, I will be forced to defend myself with non-lethal but exceptionally painful force.”</p>
<p>No one went near him, and through shouting, pushing, and mainly the last dregs of their strength, the Horns of Hammerad burst through the doors of the Adventurer’s Guild. Men and women in armor, mages sitting at tables, a [Rogue] dicing with an [Archer], even an armored Minotaur all stopped and stared at the crowd. And then at the Horns of Hammerad.</p>
<p>Ceria lifted her pack, hearing the fabric ripping and praying it wouldn’t give out at this last moment. She staggered towards the desk, and looked into the eyes of a startled male [Receptionist]. He gaped down at her, and at her three companions, all holding gold, magical swords—</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>The half-Elf croaked the words out loud and then realized there was silence. Suddenly, the shouting had gone still, and she realized that everyone was looking at her. She looked up, and saw the man staring at her, transfixed. What? Was there something on her face?</p>
<p>Was it her burnt hair, her travel-stained garments? The fortune in gold in her pack, the way Yvlon’s armor had melted onto her arms? Ksmvr, the arrows sticking out from his body? Pisces, covered in grime and dust but with magic glimmering at his fingertips? Or was it her, Ceria, a half-Elf with one skeletal hand who looked like she’d dug herself out of the ground?</p>
<p>“—I want…”</p>
<p>Ceria croaked the words in the silence. The [Receptionist], the adventurers—the people crowding around the doorway—everyone’s eyes were on her. She took a breath, coughed.</p>
<p>“—I want a full receipt for everything we drop off. And then I want a bed in an inn, but before that my companion needs your best [Healer] and potions, immediately.”</p>
<p>The man just stared at her. His lip was trembling, Ceria noticed. Was he that afraid? That stunned? What should she say? But then she felt people stepping up next to her, three of them. Pisces glared at the man at the desk.</p>
<p>“And we want food.”</p>
<p>Yvlon nodded, exhausted.</p>
<p>“And a bed. Did you mention that, Ceria?”</p>
<p>Pisces pulled at his robes, vomit-stained, bloody, burnt.</p>
<p>“And I would like a change of clothes. A new robe.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr raised a hand and pointed with another hand to his shoulder.</p>
<p>“I would like someone to pull the arrow out of my side.”</p>
<p>The spell broke. The man quavered, stepped back, and stared at Ceria.</p>
<p>“C-certainly. We can do all that. But ah, who are you? An adventuring team no doubt?”</p>
<p>“Who are we?”</p>
<p>Ceria stared at him blankly, but then realized she hadn’t introduced herself. It was customary for any new team to do so immediately, but she’d been so used to Selys knowing them on sight she hadn’t bothered. She gestured at her teammates and herself.</p>
<p>“We’re the Horns of Hammerad.”</p>
<p>“What? I thought they—you were dead.”</p>
<p>The half-Elf gave the man at the desk a wide, manic grin. She laughed, coughed, and spoke softly in the silence.</p>
<p>“We’re not dead yet.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens when the adventurers return with treasure? The real question is: how does the Adventurer’s Guild handle it? For the [Receptionists] and other staff employed at the Guilds, the moment when the weary [Warrior] walks in with a [King]’s ransom in jewels is the hardest. Things have to be immediately counted, a receipt has to be drawn up and approved by mage, guards have to be posted to prevent those with sticky fingers from walking off with everything—</p>
<p>Generally, [Rogues], [Thieves], and people with such classes are banned from the Guild for a good period of time. But the most important thing, every experienced desk-warrior will agree, is tending to the adventurers. In their post-battle state, they are often grumpy, irritated, and as of such, tending to their needs is the highest priority.</p>
<p>The [Receptionists] and other staff at the Adventurer’s Guild in Ocre might not have been high-level, but they knew that when exhausted, irritated adventurers came in with more gold than they could carry, the correct response was always ‘yes’.</p>
<p>In fact, the word yes should be accompanied by more honeyed phrases if possible, such as: On credit? Why certainly. We’ll have the best inn reserved, and porters are on the way. In fact, let me just open our emergency stash of potions right now…</p>
<p>That was how Ceria, Pisces, Yvlon, and Ksmvr found themselves in the best inn in the city in short order, clutching magically-signed receipts for their goods while Silver-rank adventurers were hired to guard the treasure now sitting in the Guild vaults. All four were swaying, but their wounds had been healed with the best potions, they’d been given a full meal which none of them had finished from sheer exhaustion, and Yvlon had already been booked to see the best [Healer] in the city, along with a [Blacksmith].</p>
<p>But for now they were too exhausted to do anything but sleep. Which they did. And when they woke up and found an [Innkeeper] beaming and ready to serve them anything they wanted—including insects and spiders for Ksmvr, if the good Antinium was so inclined—they found a bit of life had come back into their world.</p>
<p>“Do we need to get back to the Guild right away?”</p>
<p>Pisces twisted in the elegant seat he was sitting in. The private room of The Nobleman’s Disgrace was sumptuously adorned, and the meal in front of them had no less sumpt. Ceria pushed back her meal of steak—a real <em>steak</em>, cooked and seasoned despite the winter—patting her belly.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we do. It’s probably good to, I guess.”</p>
<p>“You’re sure those [Receptionists] aren’t leaving with our treasure as we speak? What’s to stop them?”</p>
<p>“The fact that every [Assassin] in the continent would be hired if they did. Relax, Pisces. The Adventurer’s Guild has a solemn contract with us adventurers. If we couldn’t trust them with what we find, we wouldn’t have anything to do with them.”</p>
<p>Yvlon laughed softly as she tore into soft bread seasoned with garlic. Her motions were stiff, but she had reassured the others that she had felt no pain in the morning, and she had several healing potions on her in the meanwhile.</p>
<p>“We should probably go soon though, because the prices for guarding what we earned won’t be low.”</p>
<p>“True.”</p>
<p>Ceria made a face. She eyed the third of a steak and wondered if she could eat it. She thought about puking up what she’d eaten and pushed it over to Pisces with a sigh. He began chomping down her food. He eyed the two experienced adventurers warily.</p>
<p>“What kind of prices are we talking about?”</p>
<p>“Oh, hiring guards, identifying magical items—I’m not sure if the Guild does that, but they’ll definitely overcharge us for the potions they gave us. We’re oozing gold, and they’ll try to squeeze us for everything they can.”</p>
<p>“All the more reason to leave right away. We should sell what we can and get the artifacts identified by a reputable mage. Unless there is a procedure we must go through?”</p>
<p>He looked at Yvlon and Ceria expectantly. Ksmvr, engrossed in eating the bread dough which he had explicitly requested from the [Chef], looked up. Ceria exchanged a glance with Yvlon and hesitated.</p>
<p>What <em>did</em> they do? She thought about it, and then felt something peculiar in her stomach. It felt…light. What would they have done, if she’d been here with Calruz and Gerial, celebrating after getting the treasure out of Liscor? They’d never…discussed it, but here they were, stuck.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Ceria’s lips twitched a bit. She smiled.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Pisces and Ksmvr looked at Ceria oddly. She smiled a bit wider, as a fuzzy sensation began to float upwards in her chest.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I’ve never found a magical artifact this powerful before. I’ve never—Yvlon, have you ever come out of a dungeon with this kind of loot?”</p>
<p>The other woman paused, and then adopted the same smile.</p>
<p>“Never. I’d never considered it. We’re walking blind, aren’t we? I’ve never seen a group come in with as much gold as we have—or with as many magical artifacts!”</p>
<p>“And they’re broken! Just imagine—we’ll have to identify them, and then see if there’s an [Enchanter] strong enough to fix them! Could anyone even do that in this day and age?”</p>
<p>Ceria laughed, almost incredulously. Pisces and Ksmvr looked surprised, but then they found the same emotion in their chests. The mage began to grin, and so did the Antinium, in his own way.</p>
<p>“Those merchants out there—they’re going to try and rob us blind!”</p>
<p>“They are!”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if every [Footpad] and [Thug] in the city’s memorized our faces. And the [Shopkeepers]—dead gods, we’ll be lucky if we can buy a loaf of bread for a gold coin!”</p>
<p>Ksmvr nodded his head as the others laughed and smiled wider.</p>
<p>“I find the prospect of being shortchanged quite pleasant.”</p>
<p>The others looked at each other, laughing, and then falling into a smiling silence.</p>
<p>“We did it.”</p>
<p>“We did, didn’t we?”</p>
<p>“We succeeded despite all the odds. We found treasure—in ruined Albez, no less!”</p>
<p>“We accomplished our task with zero casualties.”</p>
<p>Ceria looked around the table, at the three smiling faces. She couldn’t keep hers off her face. She felt a twinge in her heart, but the smile never faded. She said the words softly, disbelievingly.</p>
<p>“We really did it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Horns of Hammerad left the inn around midday, politely fending off the [Innkeeper] as he tried to entice them with more food, and the luxuries of his inn. They never noticed the young boy who sped out the back door the instant they were done eating, and so after they left the inn ten minutes later, they were unprepared for what came next.</p>
<p>Ceria put her hand on the doorknob and opened it. She walked outside, blinking at the sunlight, and was then overwhelmed by sound and motion and movement. She heard screaming, wild, frenzied, and tensed.</p>
<p>But it was no group of thugs that came to attack her, no mob. Ceria blinked and gaped as her eyes adjusted and she saw people, standing outside the inn and shouting and waving at her and the other Horns of Hammerad as they left their inn.</p>
<p>A wall of Humanity, stomping and clapping and cheering at the top of their lungs lined both sides of the street. People hung out of windows in buildings, shouting down at the Horns of Hammerad. Still more were standing on ledges or even on the rooftops, just to see.</p>
<p>They waved flags, threw colored flour—flowers being out of season—and waved desperately to attract the attention of the adventurers. People of the [Musician] class were playing their instruments loudly, and as the Horns of Hammerad exited the inn and stared, someone began hitting a drum and trumpets began to sound.</p>
<p>Ksmvr stared around wildly, confused and unsure of what to do. Yvlon was just gaping, and Pisces and Ceria were dumbstruck. The half-Elf could barely process what was occurring before her eyes. This looked like a celebration. For her? For <em>them?</em></p>
<p>Everyone was staring at her. The sun was out, and it was like a sea of faces was opened up, every eye looking at her, every face in a smile or shouting at her. It was overwhelming, even terrifying—</p>
<p>And to Ceria, it was a complete and utter surprise. She couldn’t even believe it was for her. But she took a step forwards on the cobbled street and the people went wild. They were cheering, yes, shouting—not just her name, but the name of her party!</p>
<p>“Horns! The Horns of Hammerad!”</p>
<p>“Hammerad!”</p>
<p>“Hammerbad!”</p>
<p>She’d been an adventurers for years, but Ceria had never had anyone cheer for her. Oh, a village had turned out now and then once they’d taken care of a monster threat, and maybe they’d have a round of drinks bought for them, but the old Horns of Hammerad had never warranted even a parade. And this?</p>
<p>Ceria lifted her hand hesitantly, and the <em>wave </em>of noise it provoked nearly blew her away. People were cheering and waving handkerchiefs, pointing and smiling—</p>
<p>At her?</p>
<p>She still couldn’t believe it. But part of Ceria, once she had overcome the shock, part of her understood.</p>
<p>How long had it been since she’d been a child? When had she…forgotten what it was like to be an adventurer, what it meant to ordinary people? She was someone who went into dark places and slew monsters, who went into the depths of the darkest dungeon and came out with that which shone even brighter than the sun. She was an Adventurer, a hero in the imaginations of many. And she had conquered a dungeon, the feat that every adventurer dreams of.</p>
<p>She had seen the treasure, and she had come back with it. She had proven that there was truth to the old tales, and given them something to hold onto. A bit of truth in the stories. The half-Elf walked forwards, raising her hand, and they shouted and cheered and called her name.</p>
<p>Pisces walked behind Ceria, staring, just staring. He looked down the rows of smiling faces, and felt all that attention, that goodwill directed at him. It was an unfamiliar feeling, bewitching, more enchanting than any spell. He saw young women smiling at <em>him</em>, and children running along, staring at him. He was wearing crimson red robes, the ones loaned to him to replace his dirty garments. But the [Mage], the [Necromancer] walked in them as if they were made for him, and when he made his fingers spark with magic, the crowd cheered and <em>oohed</em> and <em>aahed</em>, for there went a true [Mage], a master of magic.</p>
<p>Yvlon walked silently, in a bubble of her own. She stared at the crowd, and saw people pointing to her arms. But not in disgust. She was a wounded hero, a warrior who had survived a great battle. And her eyes found the young men and women wearing worn armor and equipment, whose eyes were on her, hopeful, dreaming of the day they might be like her. And she thought of those she had left behind, and she kept her back straight as the wind blew her golden hair behind her.</p>
<p>For Ksmvr, he felt as all Humans felt when they saw the Antinium and realized there was another world they had never known, another people. He looked into smiling faces, Human ones filled with emotion and life, and realized how small his understanding of the world had been.</p>
<p>And the Humans looked back, and saw a new kind of adventurer, no longer a nameless horror. They stared at Ksmvr with a bit of fright, but mostly awe. The Antinium waved with his three hands at the crowds, and the people cheered even at him. He might be a monstrous Antinium, but he was an adventurer too. He was special.</p>
<p>Ceria walked down the street, and breathed in. Slowly. The air was cold, but the city was warm, burning even. There were people around her, calling out her name, loving her though they had never seen her face before in their lives. She looked around, and saw a sight she had never even dreamed of in the sixty years she had been alive.</p>
<p>It was humbling, wonderful, and in her heart, Ceria felt something give. She looked over with slightly blurred eyes and saw a tall figure to her left. In her mind’s eye, Gerial walked down the street, slightly stiff but nearly bursting with pride, waving a hand now and then and going red when they cheered his name.</p>
<p>Ahead of her, Calruz strode ahead, tall, back straight to the sky, not looking left or right as he kept up his dignified façade—but loving every minute of it.</p>
<p>Behind her, Sostrom twirled his staff and emitted a shower of light particles, much to the delight of those watching. Hunt and Marian waved and cheered as well, and the other Horns of Hammerad walked proudly, marching as one.</p>
<p>For a moment. And then Ceria was back to the present, and she saw Pisces flicking his fingers and sending pink doves flying across the crowd, making them <em>shriek</em> and reach for the apparitions of light. She saw Ksmvr catch a wilted flower and eat it, Yvlon smiled at a young boy who ran out of the crowd to stare at her arms, and then she looked ahead.</p>
<p>The sky was very bright. And it was still cold, still winter. But right now she felt warm. Ceria murmured the words to herself, and let them disappear in the sounds of celebration.</p>
<p>“What an adventure.”</p>
<p>And somehow, it felt like it had only just begun.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Ryoka Griffin stood on the top of a snow-covered hill, facing the wind. Her arms were spread out, and she raised her head as the cold winter winds blew around her. The snow-flecked breeze tugged at her light clothing, a shirt and loose leggings, wholly inappropriate for the season. But the young woman paid no attention to the cold. In fact, such was her body heat that the snow had melted around her bare feet, exposing flattened grass underneath.</p>
<p>She was completely still as the air ruffled her long hair. Ryoka breathed in and felt the cold in her lungs. But she let not one muscle move; made no concession to the elements. Her breathing slowed, and Ryoka became one with nature. She was one with the world. One with the cosmos.</p>
<p>After another minute Ryoka opened her eyes.</p>
<p>“This is stupid.”</p>
<p>She dropped her arms to her side. She twisted her neck and heard a <em>crick</em>. Wincing, she rubbed at her shoulders and looked around. Then she glared at her midriff.</p>
<p>“Hey, Ivolethe! Did you hear me? I said this is stupid. It’s not working.”</p>
<p>Somewhat predictably, Ryoka’s midriff did not respond to her comment. But after a second, one of the compartments in her belt rustled, and a small head poked out. The tiny crystal head had bulging cheeks, and as Ivolethe flew out of the pouch she crammed the last bit of dried sweet fruit into her mouth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“What’s wrong, Ryoka?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The young woman paused and eyed Ivolethe. The naked faerie was just as ignorant of the cold as Ryoka was, but she had clearly been feasting in Ryoka’s pouch while the young woman tried to commune with the wind. The faerie was covered in bits of dried fruit; the sticky sweets clung to her like leeches.</p>
<p>Ivolethe didn’t seem to mind. The faerie peeled a bit of raisin off her stomach while Ryoka pushed at her hair distractedly. She spoke with waspish exasperation, but trying to moderate her tone.</p>
<p>“This isn’t working. I’ve been here for over an hour doing what you said, and all I have to show for it is wet feet and sore shoulders.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Hmm.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The faerie eyed Ryoka skeptically, and then flew around her in a quick pattern. When she stopped she looked disappointed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“You feel nothing? Even after taking in the wind?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Aside from the need to pee? Nothing.”</p>
<p>Ryoka sighed as the faerie scowled. She spread her hands.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. What <em>should</em> I be feeling?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“The wind.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The faerie gave her a look as if Ryoka was insane. Ryoka gave the faerie the same look.</p>
<p>“I’ve been feeling the wind. But I don’t feel a connection to it or whatever. Look, is there something else we can try?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I suppose we must try something else, then.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe screwed up her face in concentration. Ryoka began stretching her sore legs, watching the faerie think.</p>
<p>In theory, they were right now studying faerie magic. That was to say, Ivolethe was trying to teach Ryoka how the Frost Faeries conjured snow and moved faster than anything Ryoka had even seen in the world. Trying was the operative word here, though.</p>
<p>“Are you sure this is how you teach people faerie magic?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“No.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka paused as she grabbed her foot from behind, stretching the muscles in her legs out.</p>
<p>“What do you mean, ‘no’? I thought you knew what you were doing! You told me to stand here and listen to the wind!”</p>
<p>The faerie glared at her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“And I thought it would help! No wonder ye heard nothing, though, since all ye do is jabber on with your complaints!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m doing my best. But I don’t even know what I’m doing! What part of the wind are you talking about?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“There!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka’s head turned as the faerie shouted. All she saw was a bit of grey sky. She turned back to the faerie, scowling. But Ivolethe didn’t look like she was pulling a prank on Ryoka. She flew up swiftly into the sky, over a hundred feet in seconds, and then flew in a twisting, downwards spiral around the hill. The human girl watched her, entranced by the graceful motion.</p>
<p>The faerie flew past Ryoka in a rush of air, and then stopped. She looked down at Ryoka, smiling. Ryoka had to smile back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Did ye see it?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka paused and frowned.</p>
<p>“See what?”</p>
<p>Ivolethe’s smile faded and her face went slack. She gestured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“The wind, of course! Did ye see as I followed it?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I saw you flying. That’s all.”</p>
<p>The tiny faerie slapped her forehead and shouted curses at Ryoka. The Runner listened, slightly impressed at the variety of insults.</p>
<p>“Look, clearly I can’t see what you can. You might be seeing something by magic or with your sense that I can’t. Can you try showing me whatever’s so important another way?”</p>
<p>Ivolethe grumbled and folded her arms as she thought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Perhaps. But this is the most obvious way for me.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Another scowl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“It is not as if I have practice teaching magic to mortals. The fey come into existence knowing magic. Teaching you magic is like trying to teach a fish to swim.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka opened her mouth to reply and paused. She frowned, raised a finger.</p>
<p>“What do you—”</p>
<p>Ivolethe rolled her eyes, annoyed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“No one <em>teaches</em> a fish to swim, fool! They either know or they do not.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ah, right. Well, try thinking like a bird, then. Show me how a fish would teach a bird to swim or something. I don’t feel anything so far.”</p>
<p>A glare was the only warning Ryoka got. Ivolethe flew up, and then the wind changed. Ryoka felt <em>that</em>, and she saw a wall of white snow swirl upwards and then rush at her like a wave.</p>
<p>“<em>Holy—</em>”</p>
<p>The gust of wind and snow blew Ryoka off the hilltop. She tumbled down the slope, cursing and shouting. When she sat up, dizzy and bruised, Ivolethe flew down and grinned at her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Did ye feel anything?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“<em>Fuck you!</em>”</p>
<p>Ryoka threw a snowball at Ivolethe. The faerie laughed and flew out of the way. She conjured a snowball of her own and Ryoka raised her arm before it collided with her bare skin. The Human and faerie continued in this vein for several minutes. In the end, Ryoka stopped because she hadn’t managed to tag Ivolethe once, and she’d taken six snowballs to the head.</p>
<p>“I’m tired. And the magic soup is wearing off. Let’s go back into the city and try again later, okay?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Okay.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two began to move, Ryoka starting at a jog and moving faster, Ivolethe flying high overhead, laughing in the cold. And though she’d made no progress, Ryoka felt better. She looked at the faerie flying high above her and smiled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s an odd thing. A precious thing. Friendship, I mean. I feel like every second I’m going to make a horrible mistake and ruin things forever. But I don’t. Instead, it feels like every time I’m about to get into a fight or say something I regret I find a better word to say, or a better way to act.</p>
<p>I didn’t lose my temper with Ivolethe. Okay, I shouted and threw snow, but that was because I knew she wouldn’t care and I wouldn’t hit her. She isn’t like Erin. I can tell her exactly how I feel because she’ll do the same for me.</p>
<p>It’s so odd. Is Ivolethe a friend? Erin’s one, I’m pretty sure of that. But can I be friends with a faerie after only two days? It feels like it, but I’m not sure.</p>
<p>And how would I know? I’ve never had a good friend before. I’ve had ‘friends’, but that’s just a word. But someone who’s there for you even if it means risking their life? That’s new. And Ivolethe is about as good an example of that kind of friendship as you can get. She’s fearless, brave, and she’s quite open about the fact that she’s breaking rules to hang out with me.</p>
<p>Because that’s the nature of Frost Faeries. They’re the type of beings that go all-in with whatever they do. If they want to do something, they just go for it. And I like that about them the most.</p>
<p>Ivolethe and I return to the city in good time. I really only left it to practice her faerie magic, and since that was a bust we get back before it’s even midday. The stream of people leaving and entering Celum is still busy, but I make good time.</p>
<p>For two reasons. The first is that I’m a Runner, and I can essentially ignore most of the lengthy customs process the [Guardsmen] subject visitors to. The second is that I have a Frost Faerie sitting on my head, and news from yesterday has already gotten around.</p>
<p>It’s a strange thing. If I were in the United States and I walked around with a dangerous creature like a Frost Faerie, I’d probably be tossed in jail in a heartbeat. But in this world, I’m just treated like a high-level [Mage], or any Gold-rank adventurer, really. If Ivolethe causes trouble I’ll be held accountable. Aside from that, I’m free to do whatever I want, and people give me a wide berth as an added bonus.</p>
<p>The Runner’s Guild being destroyed would normally get me locked up and fined, but thanks to eyewitnesses seeing Persua and the other Runners grabbing Ivolethe, I got off scot-free. That may also have had to do with the fact that the Frost Faeries were busy raining ten kinds of hell on the Runners as they ran indoors, and the local Watch didn’t want to paint a target on their heads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Where are ye going?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe’s voice is small, but perfectly audible in my ears, even above the voices of the pedestrians shouting and clogging the streets. I run past them, finding less-crowded streets to turn down.</p>
<p>“I’m going to visit Erin. Then I’ll see if I can find Garia. I need to thank her for yesterday.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“The big girl with the heart of a mouse? Sounds boring.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The faerie jumps off my head and flies into my pouch even as I dodge around a laborer lugging a sack of something along. She’s so nimble! I can feel her rummaging around in there, and make a mental note to buy some more stuff for her to eat. I’ve got the coin, and it shuts her up and keeps her happy.</p>
<p>Here’s how it stands. Since yesterday, Ivolethe has pretty much been by my side day and night. She says it’s interesting and I won’t complain. She sometimes leaves, when I sleep for example, but other times she seems perfectly content to stay in my belt pouch. Especially when we’re indoors. I tried to convince her to leave, but she bit my thumb once. She’s agreed to stay in the pouch if I’m indoors, though, and a steady supply of food means she won’t break that promise.</p>
<p>I slow as I pass by the Runner’s Guild on my way to Octavia’s shop. A crowd of people, as well as a group of sweaty men holding shovels and pickaxes is gathered around the ruined building. The men are trying to excavate the building one shovelful of snow at a time, and not having much luck.</p>
<p>Some of the people watching this catch sight of me. I speed up as one of the [Receptionists] gives me a dirty look. Oops. I’d better not rub salt in the wounds. At least Persua’s not there—I heard she was being kept by the [Healer] for rest overnight, even though potions mended most of the wounds I gave her.</p>
<p>Persua.</p>
<p>I shake my head and continue onwards. So many problems, and I don’t have time to dwell on that. Erin comes first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Octavia’s shop is as chaotic as ever, but I immediately notice Erin’s presence as soon as I push the door open. Ivolethe pokes her head out of my pouch; she feels safe enough to do that here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Something smells good. Is the innkeeper girl making more food?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Looks like it.”</p>
<p>I walk into the shop and hear voices arguing with each other.</p>
<p>“I told you—no, look at that! You’ve ruined it with the potion!”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t look that bad! Stop complaining—I told you Ryoka will pay for the potions, and I want to see if it does anything!”</p>
<p>“I’ll waste gold, that’s what will happen! And—can you smell that? It’s burning!”</p>
<p>Cautiously—I’ve seen how Erin experiments by now—I edge into what should be Octavia’s kitchen. Instead, it’s been transformed into a second alchemical workplace, and two girls are bickering over a stew that’s mostly green with something bobbing in the thin liquid. I clear my throat.</p>
<p>“Erin? Octavia? Everything going okay?”</p>
<p>“<em>No!</em>”</p>
<p>They’ve got good synchronization. I raise my hands as Octavia tries to complain about Erin using her potions in her cooking, and Erin offers me a taste of whatever vileness is cooking away.</p>
<p>“I’m not here to eat anything. I just need more of that Corusdeer soup, Erin. It’s wearing off again.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Erin frowns and goes over to an open cupboard. It’s stocked with a half dozen jars of thick orange soup. Octavia rolls her eyes and calls after Erin.</p>
<p>“I <em>told</em> you that the soup was too thin this time! Too much carrot; not enough pepper!”</p>
<p>“It was worth a shot! Here you are Ryoka.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>I eye the mixture in the pot.</p>
<p>“Do I want to know?”</p>
<p>“I think this one’s a dud too. But we’re getting close; I can feel it! I’ve already figured out how to make mana soup!”</p>
<p>The girl with stitches folds her arms and snorts.</p>
<p>“That’s just a mana potion that’s slightly more edible than the rest. What’s the point?”</p>
<p>“It tastes better than your stupid potion!”</p>
<p>As the two begin to bicker, I edge out of the store. Erin seems…happy. At least, happy to keep doing this. I wonder why? I’m willing to foot the bill for her project, but I’d go nuts if I had to keep making failed potions all day. Or if I had to listen to Octavia for more than ten minutes straight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Got your magic drink?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe pokes her head out of my belt pouch, staring at the orange drink. I look at it as well; it’s just soup, but I feel like I’m holding a potion in some kind of videogame. Even long after it’s been bottled, the Corusdeer soup is warm to the touch; it’s magical, and if Erin can make anything else like it, I’ll shove gold down Octavia’s throat as long as it takes.</p>
<p>“Soup. And yes, I’m good. Let’s go find—”</p>
<p>“Is that you, Ryoka?”</p>
<p>Someone calls out to me as I leave Octavia’s shop. I whirl in surprise, and then smile.</p>
<p>“Fals?”</p>
<p>The tall Runner steps out from the wall he was leaning against. I walk towards him, smiling. Why am I so happy to see him? Maybe it’s because it feels like forever since we last spoke.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“Thought I’d find you; someone told me you were hanging out here every day. How have you been?”</p>
<p>“Good. I—good.”</p>
<p>I hold out a hand to shake his, and then pause. Fals looks down and sees my two missing fingers from my right hand. His face freezes—and then he clasps my hand gently as if nothing’s the matter.</p>
<p>“Bad run?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>It’s strange how I don’t have to explain it to him. Fals nods at me, face growing serious.</p>
<p>“I’d wondered where you went. I heard you were at Liscor from Valceif when he came back this way—then nothing. Did you finish the delivery?”</p>
<p>“I did. Traded two fingers for it.”</p>
<p>“But you did it. A good Runner never falters, and I’ve never seen you even hesitate.”</p>
<p>The compliment makes me feel better, even though I didn’t know I’d been feeling bad. I nod at him, and he smiles slightly in return.</p>
<p>It’s so strange. The last time we spoke I still hated everything about him. But now we’re—okay. I look closer at Fals and see that he’s changed a bit as well. He looks tired, and maybe not as happy as before.</p>
<p>“How have you been? Are you here on a delivery?”</p>
<p>“I was. Had to drag over a freshly-made sword for some Silver-rank adventurer in the city. It was a pain to track her down, but it was good coin. I was going to stop by the Guild, but apparently you had something to do with it being closed?”</p>
<p>I blush.</p>
<p>“Oh. That—”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. One of the Guild workers filled me in.”</p>
<p>Fals shivers a bit as the wind blows harder. He stares at my t-shirt and bare feet.</p>
<p>“Dead gods, you’re making me cold just looking at you. Is that part of your friendship with the…Winter Sprites?”</p>
<p>“This? No, this is a potion.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>I feel Ivolethe rustling around in my pouch. She’s paying more attention now that Fals is talking about her.</p>
<p>“Are they going to press charges after all, do you think?”</p>
<p>Fals shook his head.</p>
<p>“No; everyone knows how stupid it is to mess with the Winter Sprites. Besides, ah, there’s some concern about what would happen if they did charge you. At the moment you’re banned from the guild in Celum, which isn’t saying much.”</p>
<p>“Huh.”</p>
<p>I feel the pouch at my belt open. Fals blinks as Ivolethe flies up. She lands on my head, grinning at me and him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Who’s the shivering mortal, Ryoka? A lover of yours? Or just a prat?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Shut it, Ivolethe.”</p>
<p>“Ivolethe? Is that the Frost Faerie?”</p>
<p>Fals squints at a point just to the left of my head. I’m intrigued—even when she’s sitting, Ivolethe’s glamor works.</p>
<p>“Yup.”</p>
<p>“All I see is a blur.”</p>
<p>Gingerly, Fals nods his head towards Ivolethe, staring to the right of her.</p>
<p>“I’m pleased to meet you, Miss Ivolethe.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Hah! A mortal with manners! Too bad ye can’t hear me, eh?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe laughs and flicks a bit of snow at Fals. He splutters and wipes away the snow with a grin.</p>
<p>“Not fond of anyone but you, are they?”</p>
<p>“Sorry about that.”</p>
<p>I flick Ivolethe off my head, making her shout in outrage. She hits me on the head with an icy pebble before retreating into my pouch. I grimace as Fals chuckles. He stops when I glare at him.</p>
<p>“You seem like you get along with her. I wish I could hear what she says—I assume she speaks?”</p>
<p>I nod.</p>
<p>“If we go indoors you’ll be able to see and hear her. And believe me, you’ll wish you couldn’t.”</p>
<p>“Well, as much as I’d like to, that’s dangerous for her, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Too dangerous, especially for an immortal. I can’t believe Ivolethe would take the risk, but again, she goes all in. Death might matter to her, but she’d risk it for a friend without a second thought.</p>
<p>Fals notices my expression and grows serious again. He clears his throat as he shifts his weight from one leg to another.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry about Persua, Ryoka. I’m not saying thrashing her was the right thing to do, but I know what she can be like.”</p>
<p>“Yeah…I was surprised not to see you there, though. It looked like she was having a party; were you busy?”</p>
<p>He shakes his head, making a face.</p>
<p>“Hardly. I’ve been staying away from Celum on purpose. Ever since she got the [Double Step] &nbsp;Skill she’s been taking away the jobs from all us City Runners. We can barely find any work. I tried talking to her, but—she wouldn’t listen.”</p>
<p>That’s surprising. I frown at Fals.</p>
<p>“Not even to you?”</p>
<p>“Not to me or anyone else. It’s funny, but you were right, Ryoka. Persua used to be part of the team, and we’d help her and she’d help us if we needed a hand on a tough delivery or someone got injured. But the instant she was better than the rest of us? She left us behind.”</p>
<p>His expression is—unhappy. Fals shakes his head and stares at his worn shoes, looking more worn and upset than I’ve ever seen him. I stare at him, not sure what to say.</p>
<p>Part of me wants to mock him, to ask him what he expected. But I don’t. Fals is a good Runner, and he believed in working together. That Persua threw him and every one of her friends under the bus the instant she rose above them doesn’t surprise me.</p>
<p>What does surprise me is how quickly Fals was replaced in the Guild’s hierarchy. He’s the most senior Runner, and up until me and Persua, he was the best in the local area. Does that mean nothing to them?</p>
<p>What should I say? I think for a second, and then jerk my head.</p>
<p>“Come on, let’s get a drink.”</p>
<p>He’s surprised, but accepts after a moment. I lead Fals at a quick jog down the street. Another good thing. Runners don’t walk if we have a choice, so we get to the Frenzied Hare in a third as much time as it would take if Erin and I went*.</p>
<p>*Especially because she’ll stop and talk to everyone she knows. Oh, hey Wesle! How’s being a guard? Hey Agnes! Out for a stroll? Hey Mr. Dog! Why don’t I stop for <em>five minutes</em> and scratch you between the ears!</p>
<p>Agnes recognizes me on sight, and in a moment she has one of the barmaids find me and Fals a table. I order a mild ale and he chooses a ‘Firebird’, which is some kind of a local drink. It’s quite a bit stronger than my drink, which makes my eyebrows shoot up.</p>
<p>“You’re not planning on running today?”</p>
<p>“I don’t fancy going to another city for requests, and the Guild here is all messed up.”</p>
<p>Fals shakes his head as he downs half of the fiery drink served to him and drinks from a glass of water quickly. He shakes his head as I sip my drink.</p>
<p>“Not having a good day?”</p>
<p>“Try week and a half. Ever since Persua got her Skill.”</p>
<p>“Huh. I’d have thought you’d be glad to be rid of her, even if she did abandon everyone here.”</p>
<p>“I suppose that’s the one upside. She’ll be running cross-continent deliveries if she makes Courier, and even if she doesn’t, she’ll probably move up north where there’s more work.”</p>
<p>Fals sighs as he sips at his drink again. His face is a bit red, but he still looks…morose. Yes, that’s the word for it. He looks morose, beaten down, depressed. After a few more minutes, he tells me why.</p>
<p>“It’s just a bit frustrating. I’ve been running and leveling up as a [Runner] for the last…must be sixteen years already. I was the best in the area until you showed up, but you trained to be as fast as you are, so I don’t mind. All my Skills are stamina-based and defensive, anyways. But Persua gets lucky one time and suddenly she’s a better Runner than I am.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that the way the system works?”</p>
<p>“Yes. No. There’s always chance in how the Skills get assigned, but there’s a pattern to things! You put in the hard work, you get more Skills. But sometimes people can just get—lucky! And it’s not <em>fair</em>, damn it!”</p>
<p>He waves for another drink, jaw set. I feel for him; he’s going through what I felt not too long ago. What I struggle with now, to be honest. It just bites him harder, because he’s in the system and still not getting rewarded.</p>
<p>“I’d say relax. Don’t worry about it. Soon Persua will be gone, and you’ll be the best Runner again. Well, aside from me. The Guild will be fawning all over you soon enough.”</p>
<p>Fals stares at me and then laughs.</p>
<p>“It’s odd hearing <em>you</em> be the voice of reason. But you’re right. It’s just depressing seeing Persua of all people become so successful. If it was someone like Garia, I’d be cheering her on. I wish it had been her, to be honest. She could use the help.”</p>
<p>I frown over my drink. It’s not even half empty and Fals is on his second tumbler. He’s really upset. I guess I can listen; I was going to find Garia anyway, and she might be in here later.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with Garia? Is she hurt? Or is it something else?”</p>
<p>“She’s had problems of her own. Garia’s a good Runner, Ryoka, you know that. She can haul as much as a horse around, but she’s slow. And sometimes—she gets lost.”</p>
<p>The young man in front of me shakes his head, shoulders sagging. His words make me sit up in my chair.</p>
<p>“Lost? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>He waves towards the window. Ivolethe rustles around in my pouch and I order a bowl of nuts to dump in there to keep her calm.</p>
<p>“It’s the snow. Everything looks the same to her—she loses track of the road. Her eyesight isn’t as good as yours or mine, that’s the problem.”</p>
<p>Eyesight problems? Why would—oh. They don’t have glasses here. Or do they?</p>
<p>“Isn’t there a—a spell that could help her out with that? Improve her vision?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s not a matter of how far she can see.”</p>
<p>Fals flicks his wrist dismissively.</p>
<p>“If it were, there are spectacles—although it would be hard for her to wear those clumsy things while running—or she could buy an enchanted pair. Pricey, but she could save up. Her problem is that she can’t tell the difference between white and grey, you see? If she’s on the road and it’s just snowed—”</p>
<p>Color blindness. Oh. I close my eyes. There’s nothing I can do about that. Fals nods wearily.</p>
<p>“Everyone’s got problems, Ryoka. Garia’s a good Runner, but winter is tough for her.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like it.”</p>
<p>I sigh. I haven’t been a good friend—a friend at all to these people, have I?</p>
<p>“I should hang out with her more. Talk to her. I know she’s wanted to go on a delivery with me; I could do that now and then.”</p>
<p>Fals smiles.</p>
<p>“Would you? She’d love that. In fact, she’s invited me over to stay at her parent’s farm—thanks for helping her out after she got injured. I’d go, but…it would be better if two of us went rather than just me.”</p>
<p>He pauses delicately and I consider the invitation. He’s saying he doesn’t like Garia, which is fair enough, I guess. It’s not as if he has to like her, and he’s still a good friend to her. And as for me?</p>
<p>“Why the hell not? I’ll tag along sometime. Can I bring a friend?”</p>
<p>“Interesting way of putting it. I’m sure Garia wouldn’t mind the company, and she tells me her folks are just as friendly as she is. I’ll ask her about it when I see her.”</p>
<p>“She might come walking in here soon enough. She usually eats here—more often now that there’s a new cook. Were you waiting for her?”</p>
<p>“What? No, I was going to see you.”</p>
<p>“What for?”</p>
<p>Fals pauses, cup touching his mouth. He lowers it and smacks his head.</p>
<p>“What? Oh, of course! Dead gods, I’ll start forgetting my own name soon enough.”</p>
<p>He puts down his drink and leans across the table to me, smiling. Suddenly I remember that Fals doesn’t like Garia. He likes <em>me. </em>At least, I think he did at one point. Fuck. What’s he going to—</p>
<p>“You know those adventurers you were hanging out with? The ah, Horns?”</p>
<p>My thoughts freeze. I focus on Fals.</p>
<p>“Yes. What about them?”</p>
<p>“I was just in Remendia, and I heard of a big celebration that was thrown in Ocre. I missed the festivities—but apparently the city was celebrating a group of adventurers who just completed a dungeon crawl. They came out with a lot of loot. And guess what they were calling themselves?”</p>
<p>I sit back in my chair, too shocked for words. The Horns of Hammerad? Gerial, Calruz, and—</p>
<p>No, no. They’re dead. It’s just Ceria now. I remember that Erin told me she’d formed another group with Pisces, Yvlon, and one of the Antinium. But I didn’t realize—</p>
<p>I’m standing before I know it. Fals looks at me, concerned. I stare towards the door. Ocre? Not too far. It’s only midday—not even that. I can make it by tonight.</p>
<p>“I—I’ve got to go. I have to—can you tell Garia? And Erin?”</p>
<p>I look at Fals. He nods at me, understanding.</p>
<p>“I’ll let Garia know. But who’s Erin?”</p>
<p>“She’s the other innkeeper here!”</p>
<p>I shout at him as I run out the door. I’m already picking up the pace as I run down the street.</p>
<p>It’s too late now. They went through the dungeon and survived. Fals said that. It’s all over now; why am I running? But I have to see.</p>
<p>The last time I left them, they were all dead when I got back. All dead. I never said goodbye. But this—</p>
<p>They did it. I just have to see that. I have to look Ceria in the eye and congratulate her. I—</p>
<p>They really did it. I’m smiling, but my eyes are stinging as I race out of Celum and run through the snow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The young woman ran through the snow, dashing through snow banks, feet flashing across the ground. She ran fast. Well, comparably fast. To the faeries flying high overhead, she was as slow as a falling snowflake.</p>
<p>Oh, if pressed the faeries would admit that Ryoka ran faster than the snow in a literal sense. But to their eyes she was like a rolling stone, or a scurrying rodent, or the slow orbit of the sun. She moved, yes, but she ran against the wind, blundering through nature. She did not dance upon the world like they did.</p>
<p>And the faeries did dance, or fly, or maybe both at the same time high overhead. Ryoka ran on, not hearing as they flew and argued with one of their number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Why are you following her? She’s done naught interesting for <em>days</em>, sister!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the faeries complained to a faerie who flew closer to Ryoka than the rest. She sounded aggrieved, but the faerie in question—Ivolethe—just flicked her wings at her sister as she flew.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Ah, buzz off if you feel like it! What I do is my own concern!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“It’s ours if you want to give away our secrets!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another faerie called out, voice high and challenging. She was younger than Ivolethe—ancient by mortal standards, but younger in a way only the faeries would count. She flinched as Ivolethe glared at her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“‘Tis my business! Interfere and I’ll pluck out your eyes you stripling whelp!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She flew aggressively at the other faerie and the young one flew away, squeaking. But other faeries flew around Ivolethe, and they were not afraid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“It is our business, sister. You pay too much attention to her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I have cause.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“An ‘if’ on the sea of possibilities is not enough. You risk too much—death, even!—for a mortal. It is not as if she is prophesied.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“My life is my own. Or are ye a king of mine, to order me about?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Not I. But what if I was to tell <em>our</em> king of what ye do? What then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Yes! Stop following the mortal like a silly <em>pet!</em> You stay in her belongings like a kept thing! Stop!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More voices urged Ivolethe. She snarled and flew at them, but the faeries just flew around her, shouting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Yes, come away!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“We’ll tell!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“You went into the place of iron! Fool!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“It was my choice! My risk! And ye hardly helped!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe roared at them, her voice lost to Ryoka as the girl leapt over a frozen log below. She pointed at the other faeries, accusing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“What was that tripe ye brought to revenge me? Destroying a building? Throwing snow and ice at those fools? ‘Twas hardly an hour passed before you forswore vengeance and flew off as if naught had happened!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the faeries laughed at Ivolethe’s anger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“<em>You</em> went into the home of iron uninvited. <em>You</em> dared them and struck first. If you had died, we would have called for vengeance. But you are alive and only your pride is injured, so be content with that! And because of you, the mortal has a dire oath sworn against her, a prophecy of vengeance and blood!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I know.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe sighed. The faeries grew silent then; they respected oaths and vows of vengeance more than they did lives. After a while, the other faeries began to fly off. The ones around Ivolethe urged her to join them, but she just shook her head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“A little longer. A little longer. What is time to we?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Careful, sister. Do not wait too long.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Teach her if you will! But there will be consequence and dire reckoning!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Aye.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe nodded, watching her sisters fly off. She flew lower, and whispered the words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“There always is. But it will come no matter what I do or do not.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then she flew next to Ryoka and had fun creating patches of ice to trip the girl up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ceria Springwalker was not a half-Elf for whom socializing came to naturally. She could not be a social butterfly, or social squirrel, or social anything, really. She had friends, and she could enjoy a night at a bar or one of the parties in Wistram easily enough, but she’d grown up solitary, and gotten used to being alone once she’d left her home.</p>
<p>Most half-Elves were like that. And so while Ceria was perfectly content to have people fawn over her and buy her drinks (or have her buy the bar a round of drinks), she eventually had to retire from the crowds and go to her room in the inn.</p>
<p>Below, she could hear the party still going on. Pisces and Ksmvr were busy entertaining the mass of people crowding the tables below, and she knew they had to be drinking heavily even now. Pisces could put away a surprising amount of liquor despite his thin frame, and Ksmvr seemed to be almost immune to the stuff.</p>
<p>The world swam in a not-unpleasant way as Ceria lay on her bed and grinned. Some people would say that drinking before the sun had even set—in the winter, no less—was unacceptable. But those people hadn’t just cleared an ancient dungeon and come back with treasure, now had they?</p>
<p>It had probably been a bad idea to drink the last two…three mugs, though. Ceria was just contemplating a nap when she heard a commotion on the stairs. She sat up warily, and her eyes flicked to the door. She had no gold on her—rather, she and the other Horns of Hammerad had a letter of accreditation magically sealed, allowing her to draw the coin she needed from the Merchant’s Guild if need be. It was useless to thieves, but they didn’t know that and already twice the bouncers at the inn had caught people trying to break into their rooms.</p>
<p>Were they now going for a more direct assault? Ceria focused on the [Ice Spike] spell although she really didn’t want to kill anyone. Maybe a blunted [Ice Shard] spell? Or just set their clothes on fire? She heard someone shouting, and then pounding feet. She raised her hand—</p>
<p>And Ryoka burst into the room. The young woman’s hair was a mess, and she was breathing heavily. Sweat ran down her forehead, despite her light attire. Her eyes fixed on Ceria, and the two young women stared at each other.</p>
<p>“Ryoka?”</p>
<p>Ceria stood up slowly. She heard someone shout, and then Ryoka was tackled from the side. Ceria ran out and shouted at the men trying to wrestle Ryoka. She heard faint shouting, as if someone tiny and far away was trapped in Ryoka’s belt. It was almost like a buzz. But Ceria had no time to wonder what that was.</p>
<p>“Stop,<em> stop!</em> She’s a friend!”</p>
<p>She shouted at the inn’s security and eventually managed to get them off Ryoka. Ceria pulled the Runner up, surprised at how warm Ryoka felt. Then she managed to soothe the [Innkeeper], and got Ryoka into her room before she could start any more trouble.</p>
<p>“Bring up a tray of drinks, please. Something strong to take the chill off.”</p>
<p>Ceria closed the door and pulled a seat out for Ryoka. The taller Human girl sat, looking around. The room Ceria had been given was huge, the biggest in the inn, meant for a couple. She was alone in it, befitting of her role as the team’s leader. In truth, it was too big for Ceria but they weren’t planning on staying in the city for more than another night, and it was perfect for talking with Ryoka.</p>
<p>That was, if either of them could speak. At first Ceria was buzzing with questions—how had Ryoka heard they were here? How was Erin doing? Had she heard about the Goblin attack? What about Rags? But then she found herself tongue-tied, unable to say a word.</p>
<p>When had they last sat together in a room, the two of them? In the inn with the Winter Sprites, so briefly. And before that? So long ago…it had been the day they’d left Esthelm, the day Ryoka had unwisely picked a fight and the Horns of Hammerad and the other adventuring groups had gone to Liscor. So long ago. A lifetime ago.</p>
<p>Ryoka was thinking the same thing. She sat, looking Ceria up and down. Ceria saw her eyes linger on her skeletal hand and smiled just for a second. That had to be—</p>
<p>“Your fingers.”</p>
<p>The words slipped out of Ceria in a gasp. She stared at Ryoka’s right hand, at the two healed stumps of scar tissue where her fingers should have been. Ryoka started, and held up her hand. She smiled, almost ruefully.</p>
<p>“I keep forgetting how many people haven’t seen this. Yeah, I lost my fingers.”</p>
<p>“How? Where? Was it on your delivery?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. The one south. It went…south.”</p>
<p>Ryoka laughed a bit while Ceria stared at her hand. She looked away, but then deliberately held her hand out to Ceria.</p>
<p>“It’s not exactly as bad as your hand, although I wish I’d kept the bones.”</p>
<p>Ceria gently reached out and touched Ryoka’s hand. She didn’t know what to say. Losing fingers was normal for adventurers—it was all too easy to lose body parts when a monster was in your face. But it was never easy, not with a friend—</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“It happened. There was nothing I could do to stop it.”</p>
<p>“A monster did it?”</p>
<p>“Goblin. Bit them right off.”</p>
<p>“Goblins—you mean, the ones that attacked Esthelm?”</p>
<p>“Sort of. It’s a long story.”</p>
<p>Ryoka’s expression closed off a bit. She looked pained, older. Ceria saw her shake her head.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you later. I’m not here to dwell on my mistakes—and I’ve got a lot. I just had to come here, to see you.”</p>
<p>“You certainly did it dramatically. Couldn’t you have asked to see me rather than run up the stairs?”</p>
<p>The young woman grinned and shrugged, abashed.</p>
<p>“You’re a celebrity now. They were turning away everyone who wanted to talk to you. I don’t think they would have accepted my word that we were friends.”</p>
<p>“True.”</p>
<p>Ceria laughed, and the hardest part was over. She looked at Ryoka, marveling.</p>
<p>“Not a day’s passed since we got out of Albez, and you find us. How?”</p>
<p>“A friend of mine heard a rumor about some Silver-rank team that cleared a dungeon. I raced over here, and every person on the street knew where you were staying.”</p>
<p>“Oh? So you know what we’ve been up to?”</p>
<p>“A bit. Just the important details. Although to hear other people say it, you guys went into the Ruins of Albez and slaughtered every monster you saw until you found a treasure vault.”</p>
<p>Ryoka grinned at Ceria. The half-Elf had to laugh.</p>
<p>“Hardly. We were digging around in that place aimlessly for over a week! If it weren’t for the map Olesm found—dead gods, there’s so much that has happened! Did you see Pisces and Ksmvr in the common room?”</p>
<p>“I did. They didn’t recognize me, though. Of course, they were both drunk.”</p>
<p>“Even Ksmvr? I might have to go down and see that.”</p>
<p>“He’s still drinking. I’m not sure if the Antinium can get alcohol poisoning, but you might need to stop him.”</p>
<p>“They’ve got antidotes for that. I’ll go down in a bit. For now—”</p>
<p>There was a polite knock at the door. Ceria broke off and got up. The [Innkeeper] himself was at the door with some drinks for her and Ryoka. She took it and thanked him before sitting with Ryoka at the table again. The young woman shook her head as she eyed the stiff beverage.</p>
<p>“They treat you like royalty, don’t they?”</p>
<p>“Anything for the heroic adventurers. I haven’t felt this pampered—ever.”</p>
<p>Ceria sighed as she stared at her drink. She should have ordered water, not more alcohol. She paused, and looked at Ryoka. The other girl was staring at her.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. It’s just—you guys really did it, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>She looked at Ceria, something in her eyes. Ceria Springwalker shook her head, smiling, feeling something in her heart move.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t nearly as easy as the rumors make it out to be. We nearly died several times. Yvlon is getting bits of metal cut out of her arm as we speak. We’re not even sure if we can remove the armor without damaging her arm…”</p>
<p>“But you did it.”</p>
<p>“Yes. We did.”</p>
<p>How she wished. How she wished she could have said that to Ryoka at another time, in another place. In an inn in Liscor, laughing with delight as the other adventurers celebrated down below. But that moment would never come.</p>
<p>And yet, she knew that Ryoka was thinking the same thing. Seized by a sudden impulse, Ceria grabbed her mug. She lifted it.</p>
<p>“To the old Horns of Hammerad. We did it.”</p>
<p>“You did.”</p>
<p>The two clinked mugs and then drank. Ceria gulped the strong alcohol down and then sighed.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t feel real. I keep pinching myself, and I still can’t believe we’re alive.”</p>
<p>“You’re telling me? I just heard about all this, and I’m still in shock.”</p>
<p>Ceria laughed lightly.</p>
<p>“Well, we’ve had a day. I just keep thinking I’m going to wake up in the pit again or—”</p>
<p>She paused, and ignored Ryoka’s inquiring look.</p>
<p>“Anyways, the rumors are partly true. We’re rich, we’re famous, and we got out of Albez with a load of treasure and some magical artifacts. Pisces and Ksmvr are trying to get rid of it all today, but we’re set for a long time.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad.”</p>
<p>That was all Ryoka said, but Ceria heard everything she meant in it. She nodded, and then remembered.</p>
<p>“I’ve got money for Erin too—we talked, and there’s forty gold coins waiting for her.”</p>
<p>Ryoka whistled softly.</p>
<p>“That’s a lot more than she said she lent you.”</p>
<p>Ceria grinned.</p>
<p>“We’d give her even more, but we don’t have that much gold to toss around.”</p>
<p>“The rumor I heard coming into the city was that you and the others were set up for life.”</p>
<p>The half-Elf had to laugh at that, ruefully.</p>
<p>“We were. We pulled in nearly a hundred <em>pounds</em> worth of gold and gems, did you know? That would be enough to outfit us in style or pay for our retirement—Pisces, Yvlon and Ksmvr’s, at least, I’d run out before I died of old age—but we spent it instead.”</p>
<p>“On what? Magical equipment?”</p>
<p>“No. It’s going to the people who died in Liscor.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Silence descended again, but not for too long. Ceria explained.</p>
<p>“We’re giving them each a share. If we can, that is. Direct family—lovers—it’s hard to confirm, but we’ll give all the relatives of the dead what we can. It’s not enough, but it’s something.”</p>
<p>Ryoka nodded.</p>
<p>“Noble of you. Not sure it’s practical.”</p>
<p>“Neither am I. But Yvlon’s said she’ll forfeit her share of the magical artifacts if need be. I’m not sure it’ll come to that, but she’ll have last pick at any rate.”</p>
<p>“Artifacts? You mentioned those. You came away with more than just gold and jewels?”</p>
<p>“In a sense.”</p>
<p>Ceria grimaced as she explained what they’d recovered.</p>
<p>“Burnt and mangled, mostly. But they’re powerful. The trouble is, we can’t figure out what they do or if they’re still dangerous.”</p>
<p>“I can see that’s a problem. Can’t you hire another [Mage] to analyze the stuff, though?”</p>
<p>Ceria shook her head.</p>
<p>“Not in this city. There’s no one high-level enough to tell us what the items do, or whether they can be repaired. Pisces and I have had a look at the enchantments, but the more complex a spell is, the harder it is to…untangle the individual spells I guess is the best way of putting it. And since they’re all damaged, it’s even more of a mess.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Ryoka frowned.</p>
<p>“Magical weapons, huh?”</p>
<p>“And a bag and the pack of a dead adventurer. Frankly, I suspect those two might be the more valuable pieces of loot. I’m sure the bag is actually a bag of holding, and if that’s the case, who knows what could be in there?”</p>
<p>“But you haven’t opened it?”</p>
<p>“Too risky. The bag and the pack are both trapped, at least, so we think. There’s a binding spell that prevents both from being opened—or damaged—and I don’t want to mess with either one. If the wards are anything like the dungeon we just went through, I wouldn’t want the bag opened even if I were on the other side of the city.”</p>
<p>“Was it really that dangerous down there?”</p>
<p>Ryoka looked inquiringly at Ceria. The half-Elf hesitated. She didn’t want to lie, but she didn’t want to tell the truth either. Even remembering the ordeal made her shudder.</p>
<p>“It was—bad. Very bad.”</p>
<p>She didn’t press for details, but Ryoka’s expression told Ceria she would listen. And Ceria knew she had to tell her. Slowly, she began to relate the entire tale to Ryoka, skipping over only the parts that were too hard to tell her, the details of the pit.</p>
<p>“Near the end, I think we were all a bit insane, even after the spell had ended. We made a lot of bad mistakes, and we lost the majority of the treasure because we made a mistake.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t your fault. None of you were thinking straight.”</p>
<p>“That’s true enough, but we should have fallen back. If we’d just taken the time…”</p>
<p>Again, Ceria had to make herself break off. There was no use going over the moment again and again. She turned the topic away from the past and onto the future instead. She made her tone lighter.</p>
<p>“After Yvlon gets treated and we’ve had another day to rest, we’re going to have to think hard about what we want to do next.”</p>
<p>“As adventurers, you mean?”</p>
<p>“Not that. I mean, not yet. I think we’re all in this now; we’ve been bit by the adventuring beast. But we need to improve ourselves first. We all leveled up from that dungeon—several times actually! But if we want to continue, we need to get those artifacts analyzed. They’re the difference between us being Silver-rank and Gold-rank.”</p>
<p>Ryoka nodded, thinking hard.</p>
<p>“Any idea how you could do that? I have one idea, but it would be…risky…”</p>
<p>“No need for risk. I know how to get everything looked at. It’s just a matter of time and effort.”</p>
<p>“Really? How?”</p>
<p>Ceria drained most of her mug, grimacing as she remembered it wasn’t water she was drinking.</p>
<p>“One place where we know we’d find people able to dispel the magic and maybe even repair the artifacts is Invrisil.”</p>
<p>“The City of Adventurers?”</p>
<p>“Everyone just has to mention that.”</p>
<p>The half-Elf rolled her eyes and laughed with Ryoka. But then she grew serious again.</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s one of the most famous cities on the continent for a reason. It’s the center of the Human lands, and famous teams pass through there all the time. If there were any place aside from Wistram where we’d get the gear looked at, it’s there.”</p>
<p>“Sounds good to me. Only one problem though—isn’t Invrisil over four hundred miles north of here?”</p>
<p>“Six hundred? Something huge. Anyways, none of us want to make the journey, but that’s the place we have to be. A trip would take weeks—maybe as much as a month and it would take far too much coin and time, not to mention the danger if people knew what we were carrying. But…”</p>
<p>“But…?”</p>
<p>Ceria grinned.</p>
<p>“Well, we were talking about it last night. This morning, rather, while we were getting over our last hangover. If it’s too much time and effort for the four of us to go north, why not hire someone who can get there faster? Someone we can trust? They could take the gold and get the gear analyzed, and then send us a [Message] spell and ask what we want to do and bring the gear back. Of course, we’d have to have complete faith in the Runner brave enough to do all that…”</p>
<p>At first, Ryoka’s expression was intent, but then her face went slack with surprise. By the time Ceria had finished, she was shaking her head.</p>
<p>“That’s a lot of trust to put in a Runner. I wouldn’t trust anyone like that, myself.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>Ceria teased Ryoka.</p>
<p>“You’re the person who saved the original Horns of Hammerad all that time ago. And you went into the crypts to rescue me. I’d trust you with our gear and coin, and so would Yvlon. Pisces is on the fence, and Ksmvr just doesn’t know you that well. But if we got you an escort—another Runner who can fight maybe—the real issue is how you’ll carry all that gear without attracting attention.”</p>
<p>The young woman’s expression was bemused.</p>
<p>“I…may have something that could help with that. But before we go to all that trouble, I might have an even better idea. I happen to know a local expert in magic myself.”</p>
<p>“Really? Who?”</p>
<p>“I’ll introduce you.”</p>
<p>To Ceria’s incredulous surprise, Ryoka unbuckled her Runner’s belt and laid it on the table. She called out, and to Ceria’s astonishment she saw one of the compartments was <em>moving.</em></p>
<p>“Hey. Ivolethe. You can come out here.”</p>
<p>The large pouch vibrated and Ceria leaned back as she heard a <em>voice!</em> It was a voice, but something was very strange about it. She heard someone speaking, that much was obvious. And yet—</p>
<p>She heard the words. It sounded like—‘are ye sure?’. But it couldn’t be. Ceria rubbed at her ears; the sound was almost ethereal, if that could apply to a voice. It felt almost as though she was hearing the words in her <em>mind</em>, like a stray thought. Then Ryoka opened the pouch and something flew out.</p>
<p>A Frost Faerie, a Winter Sprite, one of the beings of winter Ceria had seen every year, flew into the air, whirling as vapor trails formed behind her. Ceria gasped and pushed her chair back in instinctive surprise. And fear. She hadn’t forgotten how the faeries had attacked her last time she’d met, and all half-Elves had learned very early on that the Winter Sprites were not friendly towards them.</p>
<p>But something was different about this faerie. She wasn’t the half-blurred form Ceria saw in the sky. Ceria knew the faeries had their own glamor, an illusion she could only partly see through thanks to her Elven heritage. But in the confines of the room, the magic that kept her from being seen and heard was gone.</p>
<p>She was—real. So real and delicate and wondrous that Ceria couldn’t believe her eyes. But what her eyes saw made her stare even harder.</p>
<p>She saw something else, behind the form Ryoka saw. She saw a flash of color—a face, far larger than the tiny faerie’s wrinkling her nose at Ceria in displeasure. The elfin being flicked her hair—</p>
<p>And then the image was gone. The tiny faerie flipped her hair, flipped Ceria off, and then jumped up onto the mug with the drinks. She dunked her head in it and drank, lowering the level of the liquid quite a bit. Then she sat on the cup and glared at both Ceria and Ryoka.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I do not wish to speak to the offspring of whores and slatterns.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“That’s a rude way to say hello.”</p>
<p>Ryoka glared at the tiny faerie whom she introduced as Ivolethe. Ceria just stared, awestruck. When she finally found her voice, all she could do was stammer.</p>
<p>“How did you—do you know what—Ryoka?”</p>
<p>The young woman was grinning like a child holding a huge sweet.</p>
<p>“She’s a friend of mine, Ceria. A Frost Faerie. And she’s teaching me their magic.”</p>
<p>“<em>Their </em>magic?”</p>
<p>Ceria’s eyes turned back to Ivolethe. The tiny faerie made another rude gesture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Don’t stare at me so, bastard-daughter!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The words stung and brought Ceria back to earth. Ryoka frowned hard at the tiny faerie and pushed her into the cup. Ivolethe spluttered and shook liquid off her wings, shouting in outrage.</p>
<p>“Stop that. Ceria’s done nothing wrong. Why do your people hate her so much?”</p>
<p>The faerie sneered at Ryoka.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“We don’t hate her, fool! We hate what she has become, what her existence <em>means! </em>Ask her about her people and their sin!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ceria bit her lip as the faerie spoke. She didn’t know about sin—but she knew what the faerie meant. Ryoka glanced at her face and scowled at Ivolethe again.</p>
<p>“Stop being rude. I asked you to come out because I thought you could help, not shout insults. Calm down.”</p>
<p>“Would you like a drink?”</p>
<p>Ceria offered her mug to the faerie. Ivolethe snorted and kicked the mug back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I won’t drink from your cup, half-breed!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka’s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe. She offered you her cup. That was an act of good faith.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I piss in your good faith!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The faerie shouted at Ceria, but Ryoka flicked her back into the mug again. When she came out <em>shrieking</em> in outrage, Ceria just sighed and spoke to Ryoka.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s worth it, Ryoka.”</p>
<p>“I do. And if Ivolethe is my friend, she’d heed my request.”</p>
<p>Something about the way Ryoka phrased her statement spoke to Ceria. It certainly had an impact on Ivolethe. The faerie stared up at her, incredulous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Ye’d invoke our friendship? For <em>her?</em>”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Absolutely. She’s my friend as well. And all I’m asking is if you’d consider looking at her magical artifacts.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“No! Nae! Never a million times over!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ivolethe…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Never a million times and one!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Come on.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“<em>No!</em>”</span></p>
<p>Ceria stared at the two arguing and rubbed her eyes. She stared at her mug and decided she wasn’t doing any more drinking, possibly ever. &nbsp;Ryoka kept pressing the insistent Frost Faerie.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe, I’m asking you as a friend. Unless your friendship with me isn’t worth that much?”</p>
<p>Ivolethe’s eyes narrowed dangerously, and her voice deepened far more than should be possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Play no games with me, <em>mortal. </em>Friendship is not a bargaining tool.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Sorry.”</p>
<p>Ryoka actually looked <em>chastened. </em>Ivolethe fanned her wings out, sniffed, and then seemed to relent. She didn’t look directly at Ceria, but her tone made it clear she was speaking to both girls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Even if I did consent, my help would avail ye naught.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Why’s that? Can’t you read magic? I thought faeries knew more magic than any mortal.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“True, but what we understand is not your odd system. I could read the flow of magic within such objects, but knowing the ken of such strange things is beyond me. The wh—the halfling is right. Find a proper spellcaster to do your work rather than bother me.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that, the faerie jumped back into the pouch and closed it in a huff, pausing only to drink Ryoka’s cup dry. Ryoka stared at Ceria and shrugged.</p>
<p>“Well, it was worth a shot.”</p>
<p>Ceria stared at her friend and shook her head very slowly.</p>
<p>“You’re going to have to explain what happened to <em>you</em> while I was away.”</p>
<p>The young woman grinned.</p>
<p>“I can do that. It’ll take a while, though.”</p>
<p>“We’ve got time. You could tell all of us over dinner. We could visit Yvlon then hear it from you.”</p>
<p>Ryoka nodded.</p>
<p>“Good idea. And while we do, I can talk to you about Erin.”</p>
<p>“What about Erin? Is she okay?”</p>
<p>“She’s in Celum right now.”</p>
<p>“<em>What?</em>”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you the entire story, but the long and short of it is that she needs an escort. And we also need for Pisces to track down Toren—the skeleton.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Ceria’s mind raced ahead of Ryoka’s answer and she groaned even as Ryoka told her.</p>
<p>“He’s done it. Pisces actually—no, maybe he just made one that could think. But that crazy fool actually—”</p>
<p>Ryoka frowned as she followed Ceria out the door. The half-Elf stomped down the corridor, suddenly in a foul mood.</p>
<p>“What’s he done? What’s this about Toren?”</p>
<p>“We’ll get Pisces to explain right now. If he’s not sober I’ll freeze him until he is. It’s his stupid idea with the undead. It goes all the way back to when we were at Wistram.”</p>
<p>Ceria paused as she reached the stairs leading down. She halted Ryoka silently. The young woman looked at her, and she had the presence of mind to whisper.</p>
<p>“What? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>The half-Elf frowned. She lowered her voice to a whisper as well.</p>
<p>“Pisces and Ksmvr were down there with half the city drinking and having a party.”</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“Why’s it so quiet?”</p>
<p>They exchanged a look. Ceria raised her skeletal hand, calling magic into it. Ryoka pulled a bottle from her belt. The two crept down the stairs.</p>
<p>The two were ready for anything—bandits, a crazed mob, enemy mages, monsters—even an evil undead skeleton. But neither of them had expected the smartly dressed, professional [Butler] that stood in the middle of the common room, waiting for them to come down.</p>
<p>He was the odd thing out in the world of celebration and cheer. Pisces, Ksmvr, and the many, many guests in the inn were all paused in the midst of their reveling, staring at the man in his black uniform and trim mustache. He bowed to Ryoka, arm over his stomach as she descended, staring at him.</p>
<p>“Ryoka Griffin?”</p>
<p>Ceria looked over at her friend as every eye turned to the Runner. Ryoka had a dark look on her face as she stared at the man. She crossed her arms.</p>
<p>“Who’s asking?”</p>
<p>The [Butler] straightened and gave her a dignified nod of the head. His words were crisp and precise.</p>
<p>“My name is Reynold, Miss Griffin. I am a [Butler] in direct employ of the Reinhart house. I have come here at the orders of Lady Magnolia.”</p>
<p>Ceria had never wanted a [Butler]—she’d never considered even having one before now. But now she wanted one. She stared at the man, mind buzzing with the implications of what he’d just said. Lady <em>Magnolia</em>? She wanted Ryoka? Why?</p>
<p>Ryoka’s face was completely hostile as she stared at Reynold.</p>
<p>“Oh? And what does Magnolia want with me?”</p>
<p>The man gestured towards the door. Through it, Ryoka could see a carriage, sitting horseless on the street. But it was not a simple carriage. It had to be one of the nobility’s carriages, the kind pulled by magic creations similar in nature to the fire construct Ceria had faced in the dungeon.</p>
<p>“The coach awaits you outside. If you will come with us, we will bring you to the estate of Magnolia Reinhart.”</p>
<p>“And if I refuse?”</p>
<p>Ceria stared at her friend in shock. But Ryoka looked quite serious. Reynold nodded once.</p>
<p>“I will not force you to come with us.”</p>
<p>“Wise.”</p>
<p>Ryoka sneered down at the [Butler]. He raised one finger, cutting off her next words.</p>
<p>“However, I must caution you that Lady Magnolia did not send just me.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Outside the inn, the doors of the carriage slowly opened. Ceria saw someone emerge from the carriage, but it was not Lady Magnolia. Not Magnolia, and yet a tiny bell in Ceria’s head—her [Dangersense]—rang the instant she laid eyes on the woman.</p>
<p>Ressa, the head [Maid] in Lady Magnolia’s employ, stepped through the doors, staring around the room full of silent people as if they were specks of dirt and she had a dust cloth. She stopped, her black and white dress swirling around her as she met Ryoka’s eyes across the crowded room.</p>
<p>The older woman did not smile. She didn’t frown either; she just looked at Ryoka with cold eyes, weighing her up and down and finding her wanting as before. Ressa’s face was implacable as she looked Ryoka straight in the eye and spoke.</p>
<p>“Lady Reinhart is expecting you.”</p>

		<p>Yvlon Byres knew the answer before they said it. She was not a silver-tongued socialite, but she had learned to read people’s eyes as a child. She had learned to dance with words before she had picked up a sword. Of course, she’d left that world behind to become an adventurer, but some things never faded.</p>
<p>Now she sat still and kept her face still, hoping that she was wrong. But the [Healer] just shook his head as he tapped on the silver and black metal that had become part of Yvlon’s body.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry Miss Byres. But I don’t believe the metal can be removed.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Yvlon’s tone was light and free of negative emotion. She looked the man directly in the eye; an honest [Noble] would do no less. Feeling free to speak, the man went on, speaking candidly.</p>
<p>“I am not a high-level [Healer]. Perhaps one with a Skill might be able to deal with this…affliction. Or perhaps a [Bone Surgeon], although you would have to find a Gnoll tribe’s [Healer] with such a rare class. As it is…I can do nothing.”</p>
<p>The woman stared at her arms, at the metal that felt so alien and heavy on her skin. There was no pain—only a sense of invasiveness. She could feel the metal <em>in</em> her, and in truth she had expected no other answer from the man.</p>
<p>“What of the exterior?”</p>
<p>The tall, broad woman standing next to the [Healer] cleared her throat. She was a [Blacksmith], and she touched the cold metal with familiarity. Yvlon didn’t mind the intrusion, although the [Healer] looked askance. But the [Blacksmith] only saw metal, and how it could be shaped.</p>
<p>“That I could cut away. The pieces below the skin—if that is anchored to bone I won’t touch it. Normally we’d use a saw or snap the metal in two—”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>The man hurriedly interjected and the broad-shoulder woman nodded placidly before continuing.</p>
<p>“—But with the right blade we could cut the metal. It’s warped; lost a lot of its strength in the melting. An enchanted dagger would cut most of it off and we could sand the rest smooth. It’s not easy, but it is doable.”</p>
<p>Yvlon looked at the [Healer] to see his opinion. The man nodded reluctantly.</p>
<p>“It would certainly allow the skin to breathe and prevent much of the possible infection. But even so, the metal has bonded with bone. Your arms—”</p>
<p>“I understand. Thank you.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t bear to hear any more. Both man and woman exchanged uncertain glances. At last, the [Healer] spoke again.</p>
<p>“I’ll leave you to get dressed.”</p>
<p>“And I will see if I can find a blade good enough to use. It will have to be enchanted—Dwarven-craft weapons might work, but even that would involve sharpening…”</p>
<p>Their words fell on deaf ears. Yvlon waited until they’d left, smiling politely and thanking them for their time—and paying them for their efforts. Then she sat back in the small room the [Healer] had examined her in and reached for her clothes.</p>
<p>She had still worn a breast band of course, but she had had to take off the clothing on her upper body to expose her shoulders and arms. Yvlon gazed at them now, and saw the metal. It had once been her armor, but now…</p>
<p>It looked almost like a scab. A dirty, discolored plating of metal that ran from her shoulders down to her hands. It wasn’t one unsplit seam either; jagged cracks had broken around her joints, allowing her to move her arms, albeit with difficulty. It was heavy. And as Yvlon stared at her arms, her shirt in one hand, her eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>It was a moment of weakness. The only one she could afford, when everyone’s eyes weren’t on her. Yvlon dropped her shirt and felt her eyes sting as the world blurred.</p>
<p>Cool composure. Politeness at all times. It was the mark of a Byres, and she had kept the mask up. But she hadn’t dared invite her friends, the other Horns of Hammerad. She hadn’t wanted them to hear the news, see the looks on their faces.</p>
<p>Her hands were trembling, but all Yvlon saw was metal. Ugly metal. It wasn’t beautiful, not like the silver she had worn, the silver which she’d been so proud of, her family’s colors and fortune—the name she had taken for her adventuring groups. It was ugly and tarnished and black.</p>
<p>Just like her.</p>
<p>More tears trickled down her cheek. Yvlon wiped at her eyes clumsily, feeling the hard metal brush against her eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh no. Not this. Honor and hearth. Please, not…”</p>
<p>It wasn’t <em>fair</em>. That was what she wanted to say, but wasn’t it what she deserved? And she’d been the only one with a weapon. Ksmvr had been down, Pisces and Ceria’s magic had failed—</p>
<p>She’d done what she had to do. It was her duty, and she’d been prepared for death. But not this.</p>
<p>“Not <em>this.</em>”</p>
<p>Her arms. The metal was so dull. Yvlon shook again. Strong. She had to be strong. If she let her friends down—</p>
<p>Would they think less of her? Abandon her? She had failed once. How could she tell them? What could she say? She’d already demanded almost all the gold they’d earned. What about this?</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>It had been so easy a month ago. She’d been so sure.&nbsp; Yvlon pulled her tunic over her head, slowly, clumsily. The [Healer] had offered her to help, but this she had to do herself. The fabric was far too loose for her comfort, but it was the only way she could get it over her arms. She couldn’t even raise them fully over her head; the metal dug too much into her flesh to let her.</p>
<p>Part of Yvlon just wanted to sleep. To go to sleep and forget. But then she might dream she was in the pit again, imagining she was one of her long-dead ancestors. Or worse, she might dream of Skinner, the crawling monster with crimson eyes and the undead that struck down each of her friends in slow motion. Yvlon shuddered. Her eyes filled again.</p>
<p>Someone hammered on her door. Yvlon sat bolt upright. In an instant, her eyes stopped stinging, and she used her shirt to scrub at her face.</p>
<p>“Enter.”</p>
<p>When the panting young man pushed open the door he didn’t notice Yvlon’s red eyes; he only saw her arms, and even that only held his attention for a second. He stopped and bobbed his head awkwardly to her, as if she were his liege lady instead of a common adventurer.</p>
<p>“Pardon, Miss Yvlon, but there’s trouble at The Nobleman’s Disgrace!”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Yvlon said the words and then remembered; that was the inn they were all staying at.</p>
<p>“What trouble?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. A coach arrived—a fancy noble’s coach, one of the ones pulled by magic! And a man and a woman came out, and then they said they were going to take a Runner away!”</p>
<p>A Runner? Yvlon’s brows furrowed as she tried to make sense of everything.</p>
<p>“Who? And what does this have to do with us?”</p>
<p>The young man could only gabble on as he tried to explain things from his limited perspective.</p>
<p>“The Runner? Her name was Ryoka Griffin—”</p>
<p>“<em>Ryoka?</em>”</p>
<p>“That’s right! And she said she wasn’t going,and the woman insisted, and then your Captain—the half-Elf—she said she wasn’t going either and folks started drawing their swords!”</p>
<p>Yvlon didn’t wait to hear anything else. She was out of her chair and pushing past the surprised young man in an instant. Her grief, her feelings of pain and regret—all of it she gladly surrendered to adrenaline and the need for action.</p>
<p>“My sword—”</p>
<p>She didn’t have one. Yvlon snapped at the young man.</p>
<p>“Get me a sword!”</p>
<p>She charged out the building and onto the street, running in the direction of the inn. She didn’t know why Ryoka was here, but she had saved Ceria, and if the other Horns of Hammerad were going to fight, so was Yvlon. She would not let her party die again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes Ceria wondered if she could ever have a peaceful life. If she quit casting magic and stopped going on adventures and just lived in a quiet place somewhere for the rest of her life, wouldn’t that be worthwhile? She’d never have to fight monsters and she wouldn’t wake up with bugs crawling in her mouth while it rained. She could be happy.</p>
<p>But the flaw with that idea was that even if Ceria didn’t get into trouble, her friends would. Like Ryoka, and Erin for example. The trouble with those two girls was that they tended to attract monsters and chaos like a tower attracted thunderbolts in a storm.</p>
<p>And it seemed like they were getting better at it, or at least Ryoka was. Ceria stood warily by her friend’s side, staring at a tall, austere [Maid] standing in the middle of The Nobleman’s Disgrace. Despite the countless swords, daggers, and other weapons being pointed at her, the woman appeared completely unconcerned. And Ceria’s [Dangersense] was going off, warning her in no uncertain terms.</p>
<p>To be clear, it wasn’t the Horns of Hammerad, Ryoka, or even Ressa or the [Butler] who had unsheathed their blades. Rather, it was the clientele of the inn, the revelers who’d come to bask in the presence of the Horns of Hammerad, hear stories and get drunk.</p>
<p>Ceria agonized. How had it come to this? She’d just said that Ryoka wasn’t being taken anywhere against her will, and these <em>idiots</em> had drawn weapons. On a servant employed by <em>Magnolia Reinhart!</em></p>
<p>And now this servant was demanding that Ryoka went with them again. Ceria gritted her teeth as the young woman standing by her side glared at the maid she’d called Ressa. The half-Elf knew her friend was stubborn, and she had no idea why Magnolia Reinhart wanted her, but she hoped she’d at least be tactful—</p>
<p>“Fuck you. I’m not going.”</p>
<p>If Ceria could have closed her ears off to not hear that, she would. Was Ryoka <em>insane?</em> Ceria was no native to this continent, but she had heard so many stories of the Five Families and their influence. You did <em>not</em> refuse their requests without good reason.</p>
<p>But it appeared that Ressa had fully expected Ryoka’s refusal. The [Maid]’s expression did not change; that was to say, she continued looking at like Ryoka like a filthy insect that was about to be smeared on the ground.</p>
<p>“You have no choice. Magnolia Reinhart has requested your presence. You will come with me.”</p>
<p>“And if I refuse?”</p>
<p>“Feel free to try.”</p>
<p>What could they do? Ceria looked around the inn. The other patrons were looking at the [Maid] and her, clearly waiting for her instruction. If she asked them to she had no doubt they’d throw the maid out of the inn. And then Magnolia Reinhart would probably burn down the inn and throw them off a <em>cliff.</em></p>
<p>It had to be said again. Ceria stepped forwards in front of Ryoka protectively. Pisces, staggering slightly, took her right side, puffed up with alcohol and bravado. Ksmvr didn’t do the same—because he was flanking the [Maid], ready to charge her. Ceria could only hope he’d wait for her to make the first move if it came to that.</p>
<p>“If Ryoka doesn’t want to go, she’s not going.”</p>
<p>Again, the maid only flicked her eyes at Ceria and the other Horns of Hammerad dismissively. It was as if she couldn’t see how outnumbered she was.</p>
<p>“I would advise you to stay out of this matter.”</p>
<p>That was it. Ten words. Ressa knew they were adventurers; she had to know that. And she also knew the mood in the inn was against her for all her mistress’s influence, but she was still warning Ceria. That made the half-Elf hesitate, but what could she do? Let Ryoka be abducted? No.</p>
<p>She thought fast.</p>
<p>“In that case, we’ll go with Ryoka. If you take her, we’ll be right by her side.”</p>
<p>Ryoka blinked. She turned to Ceria at the same time Pisces did. But it was Ressa who spoke. Her eyes focused on Ceria’s face and then moved to Pisces and Ksmvr. Her eyes lingered longest on Ksmvr, although there was not a hint of expression in her face or tone.</p>
<p>“Absolutely not.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>Ceria challenged the woman, trying not to flinch from the cold stare. Did she have some kind of intimidation Skill? It almost felt like she was staring at Skinner again. But she held her ground despite the sweat running down her back.</p>
<p>“My orders were for Ryoka alone.”</p>
<p>“If you really want Ryoka to go with you at least tell us why.”</p>
<p>“She knows why.”</p>
<p>Ressa looked back at Ryoka. Ceria looked at her friend and saw a faint grimace cross Ryoka’s face. There was some history here, she knew, but she didn’t have time to ask for an explanation. Ceria changed tack.</p>
<p>“Then reassure us. Ryoka is our friend; at least promise us she’ll come to no harm while she’s with you.”</p>
<p>That would be simple enough, right? If they could nail her down to a promise or—</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>It felt like <em>everyone</em> blinked when they heard that word. Ressa’s face was smooth, though. She shook her head.</p>
<p>“No promises. No bargaining. Ryoka Griffin will come with me. Or I will be forced to bring her against her will.”</p>
<p>“Oh really?”</p>
<p>Pisces’ slightly slurred voice ran out. He took an unsteady step towards Ressa. The [Maid]’s left eye twitched as she focused on him, but she didn’t make any other move. Pisces pointed at her, sneering.</p>
<p>“You seem quite confident, Miss Maid, that we will so obediently roll over and accede to your Mistress’s wishes. But the good people of this city are not so spineless as to obey even one of the Five Families’ minions when they come here to abduct an innocent Runner.”</p>
<p>His words seemed to have the opposite effect that he had intended. Half the people in the inn shifted uncomfortably at the mention of the Five Families, and they seemed to realize they were pointing weapons at a servant of a Reinhart. Their blades lowered almost as one, although most still kept them out.</p>
<p>Pisces, oblivious, kept going.</p>
<p>“And as to your presumptuous statement—I feel obliged to point out the obvious. You are outnumbered and I very much doubt your [Butler] is a master of arms. To quote an oft-repeated phrase, you and what army will take Ryoka Griffin away?”</p>
<p>Ressa made no immediate response. She just stared at Pisces with contempt. Meanwhile, Ceria and every person in the inn slowly filled in her unspoken reply.</p>
<p>What army? What army would back Magnolia Reinhart? It was more like a question of which army <em>wouldn’t</em> mobilize at her word. Every garrison of every major city in the north would back her if she so ordered.</p>
<p>Across the bar, someone slipped out the back. Ceria saw the movement, and then saw weapons slowly being sheathed, and people starting to back away. Drunk bravado had had a moment to sober, and now people were correctly realizing that this standoff was <em>not</em> something they wanted to be involved in.</p>
<p>Pisces seemed quite oblivious to this. He didn’t notice as more people began abandoning the tables around him and retreated from being active participants in the discussion to mere innocent bystanders, standing at the far end of the room. Meanwhile, the maid was waiting. Just waiting.</p>
<p>She wasn’t even really listening to Pisces or her, Ceria realized. Ressa was just waiting for Ryoka’s response again. And it was clear that saying ‘no’ a second time wouldn’t be a wise idea.</p>
<p>“Ryoka?”</p>
<p>She murmured to her friend. Ryoka was breathing heavily, and her jaw was clenched. She had something in her hand—a potion? Maybe a weapon of some kind, an alchemist’s weapon. Ceria wished she could tell Ryoka not to use it at any cost, but she had no idea what Ryoka’s relationship with Magnolia was. What should she do? If she—</p>
<p>“Ceria!”</p>
<p>Someone shouted her name. Ceria jerked, and then Yvlon rushed into the inn, a sword in her hands. She looked around for an enemy wildly, spotted Ressa. She froze in place, and the color drained from her face.</p>
<p>“Miss Ressa?”</p>
<p>“Yvlon Byres.”</p>
<p>It was remarkable how the [Maid] didn’t react to Yvlon’s appearance. She just stared at the woman, noted her arms, and dismissed her in an instant.</p>
<p>“Put the sword down. Lady Magnolia has requested Ryoka Griffin’s presence.”</p>
<p>“I—”</p>
<p>Yvlon might have been expecting trouble, but she was clearly thrown by Ressa’s presence. Thrown into a barn door, by the look on her face. She wavered, but then gripped the blade more firmly with both hands.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“What did you say?”</p>
<p>The maid’s voice was cold. Yvlon’s was just as chilly.</p>
<p>“Ryoka is my friend, and Ceria’s. If she doesn’t wish to go with you, I will back her. Even if it means defying Aunt Magnolia’s request.”</p>
<p>“That is Lady Magnolia to you. And you would be well advised not to involve yourself in this, girl.”</p>
<p>The two women locked eyes, but Yvlon refused to back down. Ceria vaguely remembered—the Byres house was one of the Reinhart family’s branch houses, weren’t they? They were definitely subservient in some way.</p>
<p>“Yvlon—”</p>
<p>“Say the word, Ceria.”</p>
<p>Yvlon’s arms trembled, but her gaze was square on Ressa. The woman only sighed; she seemed more irritated by Yvlon’s refusal to budge than worried about the sword aimed at her. She turned back to Ryoka.</p>
<p>“Well? Will you come peacefully?”</p>
<p>Ryoka was visibly hesitating. She bit her lip as she glared at Ressa. Ceria was tense; she didn’t know what was coming next and she feared whatever answer Ryoka might give. But then she saw Ksmvr raise his third hand.</p>
<p>“If I may have your attention?”</p>
<p>Ressa looked at him and her gaze could have frozen ice. Ksmvr paid no attention; his other two hands were holding a dagger and a bottle respectively.</p>
<p>“I advise you to surrender and retreat before my Captain orders me to attack. I am fairly confident it will result in your death or maiming.”</p>
<p>Ceria felt like she had inhaled her tongue. Everyone else in the inn goggled at Ksmvr. Ressa said only one word as her eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The Antinium nodded at Ressa.</p>
<p>“You have the stance of a trained warrior, but you lack armor and visible arms. Unless you hold a magical item of considerable potency or possess unarmed combat Skills, I believe I will be able to kill you if my allies and I attack in tandem.”</p>
<p>The Antinium finished with this confident declaration and waited for the maid’s response. After a moment she realized people were staring at him.</p>
<p>“…What? Are we not intending to kill her if she insists on taking Ryoka?”</p>
<p>Ceria’s head was starting to hurt. She pointed at the Antinium.</p>
<p>“Ksmvr—stand down. No one is going to hurt her, and certainly not <em>kill</em> her.”</p>
<p>“Ah. My mistake.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr nodded apologetically and stepped back. Ressa turned back to Ryoka. Ceria tried to quiet her beating heart. Try again?</p>
<p>“Can we talk about this? If Ryoka doesn’t want to leave—”</p>
<p>“Fine. I’ll go.”</p>
<p>Ceria turned in astonishment. Ryoka sighed and stepped forwards. Ressa regarded her with what looked like surprise as well.</p>
<p>“Ryoka?”</p>
<p>The Runner shrugged at Ceria, looking resigned.</p>
<p>“I’ve got no choice. I knew this was coming. Ceria, I’ve got to go.”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>The look in Ryoka’s eyes told her not to ask any more questions. Ceria glanced around and remembered her audience. She held Ryoka’s gaze.</p>
<p>“You’re sure?”</p>
<p>“Pretty much.”</p>
<p>Ryoka turned and glared at Ressa.</p>
<p>“Where is Magnolia now?”</p>
<p>“Invrisil. You will be taken to her estate which lies next to the city.”</p>
<p>The name of the city made Ryoka and Ceria blink. She saw Ryoka turn and look back at her, and then her friend turned back to Ressa.</p>
<p>“Okay. I’ll go. But on one condition. Give me fifteen minutes to prepare before we leave.”</p>
<p>The maid seemed to think this over. She looked sharply at Ryoka.</p>
<p>“Running will do you no good.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>The two locked gazes for one more second. Then Ressa’s head dipped almost imperceptibly.</p>
<p>“I will wait for you in the carriage. Do not force me to retrieve you.”</p>
<p>Without another word, she turned and walked out of the inn. Ceria stared at her back in shock, and then saw the door to the carriage open. Ryoka sighed softly, and looked at her.</p>
<p>“You’ll have to tell Erin.”</p>
<p>Then the chaos began and Ceria could only try and keep up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Holy crap, this is it. Either I’m dead or I’m going to be interrogated and tortured horribly before I die. Or maybe I survive, but I’m not placing my bets on a happy ending.</p>
<p>The instant Ressa walks out the door it’s all go. I turn and drag Ceria upstairs; too slowly, because people are already crowding around me and the other Horns of Hammerad, asking questions and shouting, speculating.</p>
<p>“Out of the way!”</p>
<p>I shout at them as I push for the stairs. Ceria seems to get what I’m trying to do and helps me push.</p>
<p>“Move aside! We have to hurry!”</p>
<p>They don’t want to let us go. People are pulling at me, asking me how I know Magnolia Reinhart, what my business is with her. I want to punch them but I don’t have time for a brawl—</p>
<p>“[Frozen Wind].”</p>
<p>Someone whispers the spell. I hear <em>shrieks</em>, and then feel the cold air blow past me, freezing me in an instant. Pisces lowers his hands as the crowd suddenly backs up. The spell he cast wasn’t deadly, but damn, it looks painful. He pushes both of us up the stairs and Yvlon and Ksmvr are behind us in a flash.</p>
<p>“In here.”</p>
<p>I push into Ceria’s room and take a breath. She looks at me, wide-eyed and bursting with questions, but I know I can’t answer any of them right now. I don’t even know if I should. I can’t drag her into this. God, what is Magnolia going to ask me?</p>
<p>“Ryoka, what—”</p>
<p>“Fifteen minutes. Probably more like ten.”</p>
<p>I cut her off as I snap. I pace around the room, already trying to figure out the fastest way through the streets.</p>
<p>“Figure out how much gold you need to give me, and get all those damaged artifacts and whatever else you want me to get analyzed. I’ll take it—I’ve got a bag of holding of my own.”</p>
<p>“You <em>do?</em>”</p>
<p>I touch the bag Teriarch gave me at my side.</p>
<p>“It should fit everything. Can you put a bag of holding in a bag of holding?”</p>
<p>“Do not attempt that.”</p>
<p>Pisces stares at me intently as he stands against one wall. Ksmvr and Yvlon are just staring as Ceria sits on her bed. I nod at him.</p>
<p>“I’ll keep the backpack and the other pouch separate, then. Have it all ready before I get back; I need to go and that stupid maid isn’t going to wait.”</p>
<p>“We can do that.”</p>
<p>Yvlon speaks, looking at the others for confirmation. I meet her eyes; should I say anything? We didn’t even say hello, and suddenly we’re doing this. I still remember punching her—</p>
<p>“Ryoka, are you sure about this? You don’t have to go if you’re not sure.”</p>
<p>I tear my eyes away and look at Ceria.</p>
<p>“I think I have to. If I don’t, there will be trouble.”</p>
<p>Now that I know how big a fish Magnolia Reinhart is, I have no desire to push her. Pisces nods.</p>
<p>“It would be best if Miss Ryoka went with the servants without a fuss. We are only fortunate that the fools down below were not completely insensible to reason, or else we all might be in a serious predicament.”</p>
<p>We all stare at him. Pisces still reeks of booze, but he doesn’t look nearly as unsteady as he was a few seconds ago. Ceria gapes at him.</p>
<p>“Wait. You did that on <em>purpose, </em>didn’t you?”</p>
<p>He sneers. Of course. I nod at him, and turn to the door.</p>
<p>“Get everything you need to give me. I’ll be back—”</p>
<p>“Where are you going?”</p>
<p>Ceria looks worried. I turn.</p>
<p>“Runner’s Guild.”</p>
<p>“<em>What?</em>”</p>
<p>No time to answer. I rush down the stairs, nearly trampling the innkeeper who’s trying to listen at the door, and push out of the crowd. I get one glimpse at the coach—surrounded by a crowd of people who don’t quite dare to get any closer—and then I’m running full-tilt down the icy street. Damn. My feet are cold. At least I have one of Erin’s jars of Corusdeer soup. I should have gotten more.</p>
<p>As I run I fumble at my belt. I call out, ignoring the looks I’m getting as I run down the street towards the Guild.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe. You’re going to have to get out.”</p>
<p>The faerie flies from my pouch and up to my head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“You go to meet this woman? The others seem truly fearful of her name; it betokens </span><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">much of her, does it not?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It does. And you—you’ve got to stay away from her. You can’t go in her house. Magnolia’s extremely dangerous.”</p>
<p>Is she? I’ve never figured out how dangerous she is, but I know that she’s smart and she employs [Assassins] and she’s rich. I’m going with maximum paranoia to be on the safe side, and at the top of my list is not getting Ivolethe in the same position as she was with Persua.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I will follow ye.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe agrees readily, which makes me feel relieved. But then she flies closer to my face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Know this, Ryoka. I am your friend, but in matters of life and death, I must not interfere. We have broken the rule twice; but we had cause and sacrifice, you understand? It must not, will not happen thrice. Remember that.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>I’m on my own. Ivolethe nods, and flies up. She lets me run on until I get to the Runner’s Guild. How much time has passed? Only three minutes? Five?</p>
<p>I <em>slam </em>the doors open and rush up to the front desk. I thrust aside a female Runner, ignoring her shout of anger and point at the [Receptionist]. He blinks at me.</p>
<p>“Get me…every delivery you have for Invrisil.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Everyone says that word. Why? It just wastes time. I pant as I clarify my statement in as few words as possible.</p>
<p>“I’m about to go directly to Invrisil. Today. If you have a multi-part delivery…Courier deliveries…anything. I want it.”</p>
<p>Multi-part deliveries are like Courier deliveries, only the people sending the packages can’t pay the exorbitant amounts demanded by Couriers. So they hire City Runners to take the delivery as far as they can go, and then another Runner will complete the request. It’s a useful relay system, although it still costs a lot.</p>
<p>The man at the desk spreads his hands as I try to calculate how much the carriage can carry.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry Miss…Ryoka, is it? I can’t just—”</p>
<p>I grab him and drag him over the desk. He yelps, and I growl at him.</p>
<p>“I don’t have time for this. <em>Give me the deliveries.</em>”</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, I’m rushing back down the street. Turns out even a [Receptionist] can run fast when you’re literally kicking him around. I have a bundle of deliveries in my hand and more in my pack—some are damn <em>heavy</em>. Two more Runners are racing after me, carrying more things bound for Invrisil. I couldn’t take everything, but I got a huge amount.</p>
<p>Ressa <em>stares</em> at me as I fling open the carriage door and start shoving packages inside. Her intimidating glare* doesn’t stop me from piling the rich seat next to her with deliveries. I’m secretly enjoying every second of this, but I keep my face straight.</p>
<p>*Yeah, I’ll admit it, she scares me a bit. She’s like a perfect Victorian maid if you secretly suspected that they could kill you with their bare hands.</p>
<p>“Sorry, you’re going to have to budge over. I’ve got some really big stuff to take as well.”</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Deliveries. I’m a Runner.”</p>
<p>I slam the door in Ressa’s face before she can respond and turn to the panting Runners behind me. They’re breathing hard from that little run? Disgraceful.</p>
<p>“Okay, load the rest of the deliveries into the coach.”</p>
<p>Is it a coach or carriage? Wait, they’re both the same thing, aren’t they? My mind’s running too fast to focus on anything. I point to the vehicle, ignoring the hesitation on the faces of the Runners.</p>
<p>“Go on.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>The female Runner looks hesitant. Understandable I guess; this definitely doesn’t look like a bulk transport. I nod.</p>
<p>“Get it on there. Hurry up!”</p>
<p>The voice of command is a wonderful thing. They get to work, and I look around and see if I can spot Ceria and the others. I wonder if Ressa will snap when I bring all of their gear as well.</p>
<p>God. This is the stupidest thing I’ve ever done, and I’ve got a list. But it makes sense! I’m getting a free ride to Invrisil, or rather I don’t have any choice, so I might as well milk it for all I’ve got. I’ll get paid, I can help my friends out—</p>
<p>The Runners are hesitating as they open the door and find Ressa glaring at them. I think they’d be more comfortable with a snake in the carriage. I certainly would be.</p>
<p>“Well? Go on; toss it in. Ignore the [Maid].”</p>
<p>I’m playing a dangerous game here. I’ll probably end in me getting my ass handed to me, but I don’t care. If Ressa thinks she can push me around—</p>
<p>Well, she’s right, but I’m getting my revenge this way. I gesture at the Runners, and hear a cough behind me.</p>
<p>“Miss? There is a trunk, as well as space above.”</p>
<p>I turn and see the [Butler]. Honestly, I’d put him completely out of my mind. But now that I look at him and his dapper suit—I sort of want to deck him as well as Ressa. He reminds me too much of my folks’ home. True, they didn’t have servants, but…</p>
<p>Actually, we did, didn’t we? I mean, it wasn’t as if we had our own butlers and so on, but gardeners, pool people, personal masseuses and so on—that’s a lot of people at your beck and call.</p>
<p>Damn it, mom and dad.</p>
<p>Anyways, what was he saying? A trunk?</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>He points. My eyes find a subtly disguised trunk on the back of the big carriage.</p>
<p>Holy crap, there is! Do all carriages have trunks? Well…obviously. I haven’t ridden in any before now, in my defense. And can it fit all the deliveries? I open it and peer inside. Wow. It can!</p>
<p>But then, this is no ordinary carriage. If the ones from my world are like regular cars, this one’s pretty much a combination of a truck, limousine, and race car. It’s <em>huge</em>, plenty big enough to hold a full assortment of passengers and the deliveries I’m bringing, and it looks lavish. Plush upholstery, gilded exterior—magic horses. Did I mention that?</p>
<p>“Ryoka!”</p>
<p>I turn from supervising the Runners as they pull the deliveries out of the carriage and redeploy them in the trunk to see Ceria and the other Horns of Hammerad. I realize I haven’t even said hello to Yvlon, Pisces, or…the Antinium.</p>
<p>Who is he? I remember Klbkch and Pawn, but this is the other one, isn’t it? How many Antinium does Erin know? I see they’ve got a bunch of pretty beat-up looking weapons in their hands. Are those the magical artifacts? God, they look so beat up. They don’t even glow—well, one is glowing, but it’s very faint.</p>
<p>“Here.”</p>
<p>They shove the weapons at me and I fumble at my side. My bag of holding can hold everything they’ve got—one buckler, a sword, the blade of a sword, and a dagger. The pack and small bag that looks sort of like mine* goes into the trunk. Ceria pours gold into the bag, several hundred gold coins! The crowd watching us is murmuring, and I just pray like hell they don’t try and rush us.</p>
<p>*Definitely a bag of holding. I mean, who <em>wouldn’t</em> use one? Forget wallets; I want this thing if I ever get back to my world. I can literally fit the kitchen sink in here.</p>
<p>“Do you have everything?”</p>
<p>“Think so. Did I miss any items?”</p>
<p>“No. And you’ve got the gold…? Good. And you know what to do?”</p>
<p>“I’ll get all of it looked at. Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“And if you have to make a decision—”</p>
<p>“If I need to I’ll send a [Message] spell. I’ve got it.”</p>
<p>Ceria and Pisces try to tell me how to find the best mages to analyze the weapons. Yvlon tells me what price is worth paying for a mage and when I should walk away. Ksmvr tells me that I should attempt to use aggression and tact in my dealings, whatever that means. And then…then we just stand around awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Well. I guess I’ve got to go.”</p>
<p>Ceria smiles at me, worry clear in her eyes.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe this is happening, Ryoka. This is so—sudden.”</p>
<p>“Fortuitous, perhaps.”</p>
<p>Pisces remarks as he nods at the carriage. He eyes me.</p>
<p>“I would advise you to guard your tongue when you are meeting with Magnolia Reinhart, Miss Ryoka. It would be…unfortunate if something untoward were to occur on your journey.”</p>
<p>“It would be a zemblanity, you mean?”</p>
<p>“A…pardon me?”</p>
<p>I grin at Pisces’s face. He’s not the only person who can use words to befuddle people. I turn and nod at Yvlon. My eyes fix on her arms—I’d barely seen them before, but looking at them now, I’m both sickened and amazed at how her skin seems to meld with the metal. But I jerk my gaze away and meet Yvlon’s eyes instead. She nods at me, smiling with a trace of bitterness.</p>
<p>“Good luck, Ryoka.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>It feels like there’s a thousand things we should say, but that’s all I have time for. I nod to Ksmvr—not much to say to him, really, and then I look at Ceria.</p>
<p>“I’ll be back soon.”</p>
<p>That’s all. I know, it’s like the worst thing I could say if I were in an action movie or a horror film. But really, I feel the same sort of foreboding come over me as I open the door of the carriage and step inside. Ressa doesn’t even look at me as I scoot into the spacious interior and wave at the Horns of Hammerad.</p>
<p>Famous last words. But I said them—and I did all this, offer to analyze the weapons, even grab all those deliveries—because I am afraid. I’m doing this because I want to believe there’s a time after meeting Magnolia. There probably is. I shouldn’t worry, but part of me does.</p>
<p>I ran from her at first. It was so long ago, I’d nearly forgotten. But she knows. She was the first person to figure out where I came from, and I still remember how she could command me so easily. And now I’m on a trip to meet with her. I can only pray it’s not one-way.</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>I try to make the word challenging as the door closes and I look at Ressa. She glances up at me, and turns her head.</p>
<p>“Reynold? Take us away.”</p>
<p>I hear the [Butler] moving outside the carriage—he’s in a pretty decent seat outside, even if it is exposed to the wind. He doesn’t crack the whip since there are no horses; rather, the coach begins to accelerate with only the faintest shift in equilibrium.</p>
<p>I stare out the window and see the world moving with surprising speed as the butler drives us down the street. I look outside and then see something odd.</p>
<p>People. Waving at us. Their mouths are open, and I open the door slightly to confirm what’s happening. Noise immediately enters the carriage. Not just noise; cheering.</p>
<p>Yes, that’s right. There’s people lining the streets, the crowd at the inn and countless people who came out to see what the fuss was about. Now they’re giving us a sendoff as if we were a bunch of celebrities—which we sort of are, I guess.</p>
<p>It’s still unbelievable to see. A sea of faces passes me by as the coach picks up speed. The citizens of Ocre are waving and laughing and even throwing…is that colored flour? Why? They’re waving and cheering—do they even know why Ressa is here or that it’s me? Or are they just that thrilled by the nobility?</p>
<p>“You fucking people.”</p>
<p>I pull the door open and flip off the cheering crowd. I hear the cheering falter, much to my satisfaction. Then I notice Ressa looking disapprovingly at me, which is to say like normal. I pull my hand back in and flip her off as well. That’s the beauty of the middle finger. It’s multi-purpose and reusable.</p>
<p>Once again though, the maid doesn’t rise to my bait. Ressa just sits in the carriage, not staring at me but rather looking out the window on her side in silence. I can tell she’s aware of me, but she’s giving me the cold shoulder. The freezing shoulder, if I’m honest.</p>
<p>As we speed out the gates to the city, I see the landscape begin to blur as we move impossibly fast. Holy crap, how fast are we going? I barely feel the acceleration, but it feels as if we’re easily passing eighty miles an hour. How can we do that in the snow? And what if we hit a rock? Or a pothole? These roads aren’t like the highways in my world!</p>
<p>But Ressa appears unconcerned, and I can’t even feel the coach jolting along. It must be magic that’s keeping us stable as well. That’s a lazy explanation, but I don’t exactly have the opportunity to analyze the way the wheels are interacting with the ground.</p>
<p>I stare back at Ressa. She’s still sitting and not looking at me. And as the adrenaline and excitement of the last fifteen minutes finally fades from my system, I realize this is happening.</p>
<p>I’m going to meet Magnolia Reinhart. I’m not ready for this.</p>
<p>And I’m nervous. I stare harder at Ressa, but I know she’s not going to talk to me. She doesn’t like me, probably because I’m a rude asshole. So what should I do?</p>
<p>I could…sit here. I guess. The inside of the carriage is very spacious and I can stretch out my legs. There’s plenty of room, and even a small <em>table</em> in the center. There’s something covered by dark blue cloth on it. I wonder what it is? Yeah, I could be a peaceful guest and let this [Butler] and [Maid] take me to Magnolia like a good little girl.</p>
<p>Or—</p>
<p>The dark upholstery of the carriage is almost sinfully comfortable. I sink into it, and then twist. Ressa’s eyes turn as I prop my legs up on my side of the carriage and put my bare (and dirty) feet on the lovely padding. I cross my arms as I sit with my back to one wall of the carriage and stare at her. She looks pointedly at my feet but I don’t move them.</p>
<p>“So. You did it. You got me here, and now you’re delivering me to Magnolia. Well done, you.”</p>
<p>No response. Ressa stares at me for another second and then goes back to staring out of the window. I sigh, loudly and as obnoxiously as possible.</p>
<p>“So what does Magnolia want from me? More juice? Something else? Or does she just want to chat?”</p>
<p>Silence. I edge a bit lower in my seat, so I’m nearly lying down.</p>
<p>“You know, it’s odd that she sent <em>you</em> to pick me up. Aren’t you the most important servant? The demi-head honcho? Isn’t it demeaning to have to come all this way?”</p>
<p>No response. But I’m pretty sure I’m getting to her. And let’s be fair, among my few talents, I do have one skill which I’m unrivaled at: pissing off people*.</p>
<p>*I might not be a world champion or anything, but I’m probably at least a state or national champion when it comes to authority figures. It’s not just being a jerk or stupid; you have to be willfully annoying. It’s an art and I’m a connoisseur.</p>
<p>“So what does she want? Can you give me a preview? A hint? Or is it meant to be a surprise?”</p>
<p>Ressa looks over at me with clear annoyance. She seems to consider a range of options, and then indicates the table with the covered cloth.</p>
<p>“Lady Reinhart has sent provisions in case you are hungry. Please avail yourself.”</p>
<p>Translated, what she really means is ‘eat something and shut up’. I pull back the cloth and find a rather impressive spread of food. Cheese, meats—even wine! I’m tempted, but I’d be an idiot if I actually had some.</p>
<p>Right? I’m tempted, but I wonder if it’s spiked with something to make me more truthful. Then again, couldn’t Magnolia just have her servants restrain me and pour the truth serum down my throat if she wanted?</p>
<p>Even so, I’m not hungry and I’d rather just annoy Ressa.</p>
<p>“Any idea how long this trip is going to take?”</p>
<p>No response. I smile a bit; I’m enjoying this.</p>
<p>“No? What about games? It’s sort of boring just sitting here. Do you have anything fun to do?”</p>
<p>Ressa’s eye is twitching again. I grin wider. She looks up, and speaks briefly.</p>
<p>“Would you like me to hit you?”</p>
<p>I…pause. My instinct is to goad her, but Ressa’s eyes are very serious. And as I’ve noted, she’s not exactly one to shy away even when outnumbered. I could probably beat her in a fight—but why would Magnolia send her by herself if she was incapable of defending herself or subduing me?</p>
<p>As all that flashes through my head I remain quiet. Ressa holds my gaze for one more second and then nods.</p>
<p>“In that case, be silent.”</p>
<p>And then she goes back to staring out the window.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ve ever been—</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Back home, back in my world when I was younger I got that threat once or twice, when I’d exhausted every other possible response from the adults I was needling. My response back then was ‘try it’, and if they did I was ready. But here, even with martial arts which I’ve admittedly been neglecting to practice, I’m at the bottom of a very tall totem pole in terms of fighting ability.</p>
<p>I stare at Ressa. She wouldn’t—</p>
<p>Yeah, she would. Crap. What do I do now?</p>
<p>It takes me exactly five minutes to figure out what to do. Ressa looks up sharply as I open the carriage door.</p>
<p>“<em>What are you doing?</em>”</p>
<p>“I’m going up front. I think I’ll like the view up there.”</p>
<p>As I open the door, wind <em>howls</em> into the carriage. I jerk back—I’d forgotten how fast we’re going! Flying snow blows in and I see the world whirling past, impossibly fast. But hell, I can see Reynold up ahead and if I climb…it would be instant death if I fell out.</p>
<p>Ressa watches me as I hesitate at the door. For a second I wonder if she’ll yank me inside, but then she turns and calls.</p>
<p>“Reynold. Slow the coach.”</p>
<p>There’s a little window he can hear us through. The [Butler] immediately slows the coach. I wait until it’s at a stop and then hop out. Ressa stares at me impassively as I walk up to the front and jump up next to the astonished [Butler].</p>
<p>“I’m sitting up here.”</p>
<p>He just stares at me before he nods.</p>
<p>“Very good, Miss.”</p>
<p>He pulls at a bunch of reins tied to the ghostly horses and the carriage begins to move again. I hear the door <em>click</em> shut behind me, and wonder why Ressa let me get up front. Maybe she just doesn’t want to deal with me. That makes sense.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I instantly regret my choice as the carriage picks up speed again. It’s not the snow buffeting me that gets me down—the magic coach actually seems to deflect the snow particles. More magic, I guess, and a flying pebble or stick could probably kill the driver.</p>
<p>But it’s still frickin’ <em>cold.</em> And I’m not moving and Erin’s soup has worn off. I’m shivering, but I refuse Reynold’s offer of a coat. Instead, I just sit up front and let my body get used to the low temperatures. And as the carriage continues to pick up speed, even the freezing weather is banished from my mind by the <em>speed</em>.</p>
<p>I’ve been in cars. Hell, I’ve driven them pretty damn fast and gotten arrested for it. But this—this is totally different.</p>
<p>Consider, a car moves up to…eighty? Ninety miles per hour? Maybe a hundred if you were insane, but that’s pretty much the upper limited outside of race cars. And even open-roof cars have a windshield and a good bit of car in front of the driver. But this—</p>
<p>This is something else.</p>
<p>The wind blows by my face, a tempest of snow and air. The landscape flashes by impossibly fast in my face, and I see all of it, not just the narrow view from the windshield. I’m staring, and I know my jaw is open.</p>
<p>This is life in the fastest lane. This is the sight every runner chases, but more than any normal person could imagine. Maybe Val and Hawk see this as they run. But this is a first for me. I look out, and see a mile flash by in moments. I see people flick by, small shapes on a road. We’re off road—surging smoothly up and down a hill, almost as if we’re anchored to the ground.</p>
<p>It’s so beautiful. It’s wild and quick and magical. And as if that thought calls her, I see a flicker of blue flying out of the white landscape. Ivolethe laughs and flies next to us, flying next to the coach as if she’s coasting on a breeze.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe?”</p>
<p>My words are snatched away by the wind, but Reynold hears them. The [Butler] glances at me and I shake my head. The faerie hears me too; she flies closer and speaks in a little voice audible even over the howling winds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Look, Ryoka! Look! This is what you need to see!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The faerie flies closer, next to me and points. She laughs as a flurry of snow engulfs her and then flies out of it, trailing vapor, a blue spark of color amidst the gale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“<em>The wind! </em>Can ye see it? The wind blows! We run with it!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She flies out, skimming across the land in front of us. She darts up and around, catching a current moving so fast that it speeds her past the carriage. Then she’s zooming behind us, flying up, low, around, like azure lightning.</p>
<p>I follow her, entranced, seeing her shape, the sole constant in a world lost to the blur. And as she flies about, following some unseen path, I glimpse something. It’s faint; it’s like a trail in the air itself. It doesn’t have color; rather, it’s like a ripple, just like heat makes the air shimmer across the ground. I see it flex ahead of Ivolethe and accordingly she flies up and down and then spins away.</p>
<p>“I see it!”</p>
<p>Reynold jumps in his seat as I half-stand and scream at Ivolethe. She does a double-take in the air and flies towards me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Truly!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Yes! I see—”</p>
<p>I hesitate. The trail is gone. I squint at where it was, and then look at Ivolethe.</p>
<p>“It was there. I’m sure of it.”</p>
<p>The small faerie grins at me, delighted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I believe ye. This is the first step. If you saw that then—”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You think I can do it again?”</p>
<p>“Miss?”</p>
<p>A voice interrupts Ivolethe’s reply. I look over and see Reynold staring at me, eyes wide.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Are you, ah, speaking to me?”</p>
<p>“What? No. Of course not. I’m speaking to—”</p>
<p>I pause and stare at Ivolethe. I glance back at Reynold and realize that he can’t see the Frost Faerie, or if he can, she’s only a faint blur. Ah.</p>
<p>“Um. I’m speaking to myself. Don’t mind me.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss.”</p>
<p>Slowly, I sit back down. Ivolethe grins at me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Are ye scaring the poor mortal?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Probably.”</p>
<p>I glance over at Reynold. He’s hunching over in his seat, pretending he can’t hear me. His [Butler]’s façade is a bit ragged as he studiously ignores my one-sided conversation, at least from his perspective.</p>
<p>Ivolethe shrugs, as if she couldn’t care less about Reynold. Which is probably true. She points to the whirling scenery and grins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Yon contraption is quite a thing! It moves almost as fast as ye did when you drank the magic brew.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“When? Oh, you mean in the castle. Do you think I could ever learn to run this fast?”</p>
<p>The faerie considers this and shrugs as she props her chin on her hand. She sits on the air next to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Perhaps. But not at first. I can sense the magic in this thing; it is rough, but there is an art to it. Does the lady who sends her servants to you have much wealth like this?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A lot. I don’t know how much, but she’s one of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals on the continent.”</p>
<p>That makes me worried again, but having Ivolethe around dispels a lot of my fears. The faerie nods seriously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Then perhaps a bit of respect is in order. The lords and ladies of the land were always touchy and prideful, even to the King of Knights.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“King Arthur?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Aye.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe smiles and points. I turn my head and see Reynold is actually edging away from me on the front of the carriage. That makes me smile too. I wonder if I should explain to him what’s going on—but nah.</p>
<p>The faerie pauses as she seems to glance at the horizon ahead of us. She frowns at me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“There is much moving in the world this time. Much happens even as ye ride about.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Oh? Like what?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Like the children. They are marching.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The…children? Who?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“The youngest. The ones with small ears and crimson eyes. They burnt a city, did they not? And they fight amongst themselves. They are moving about in the snow.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She means Goblins. The children? The youngest? I frown at Ivolethe, but decide to pursue their movements before I ask about the other bit.</p>
<p>“What do you mean they’re moving? Moving where?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Everywhere. They run about in their hundreds, coming north from south. A vast army sits below the pass—you have seen them once.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Goblin Lord. I shiver. Ivolethe nods, and then points ahead of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“But another army—smaller, but thousands strong—lies ahead. They march north as well. Fleeing their own kind.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What? Where?”</p>
<p>I sit up in the carriage, heart pounding. Ivolethe nods at Reynold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Yon clueless fool is about to drive you straight into the center of them.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a second I just stare at Ivolethe in horror. She grins at me, exposing a mouth full of sharp teeth. Then she flies up and away.</p>
<p>Instantly, I turn in my seat.</p>
<p>“Driver, turn the coach around!”</p>
<p>Reynold stares at me. He looks around, and then points to himself.</p>
<p>“D-do you mean me, Miss—?”</p>
<p>“Stop the carriage! We’re about to run into Goblins!”</p>
<p>“Goblins?”</p>
<p>He just stares at me incredulously. I see a large hill approaching, and curse. I reach for the reins. Instinctively Reynold pulls away.</p>
<p>“Please don’t, Miss Ryoka. I can’t let you—”</p>
<p>“What is going on?”</p>
<p>Then a panel slides open behind us. I see Ressa’s impatient glare as she looks at us. There’s no time to explain. I try to grab the reins. Reynold pulls away, Ressa shouts. The carriage swerves as we crest the hill—</p>
<p>And then there are Goblins. They march in a vast column across the valley in the snow, trampling slush into mud as they walk a hundred abreast. I see Hobs, dragging weapons in the snow, massive, dwarfing the smaller Goblins that run before them.</p>
<p>Children, what look like pregnant mothers and of course, warriors walk in some semblance of order, carrying packs, lugging improvised sleds—some are even herding horses, mules and other pack animals! It’s the most hodge-podge collection of equipment I’ve ever seen. And at the head of that group is a detachment of Carn Wolves. Ridden by Goblins.</p>
<p>My heart stops. The sudden surge of fear and panic makes the world slow as the carriage shoots over the hill and directly into the mass of the Goblins. I turn my head and see Reynold frantically pull the reins left. The carriage immediately turns, but it’s too late.</p>
<p>Goblins, hearing the sound of the carriage and the shower of snow, turn and cry out as we speed past the column. I hear their high-pitched screams, and then horn calls.</p>
<p>Instantly, the group of wolf riders at the head of the column turns. They run towards us and I shout.</p>
<p>“Take us away!”</p>
<p>Reynold desperately pulls, and the carriage turns. But although we’re already speeding away, the Goblins are <em>everywhere. </em>And this particular bunch is smart, because the wolf riders are already running to cut us off. We must have passed some scouts because they come from behind us, trying to run us down.</p>
<p>I see a tall Hobgoblin on a Carn Wolf running at us, shouting as more riders run with him. The main column of Goblins is in panic—warriors are surging towards us en masse as the children and other Goblins try to run back.</p>
<p>“What should we do?”</p>
<p>Reynold shouts in fear as the wolves box us in. He’s trying to pull us away, but the wolves are <em>everywhere.</em></p>
<p>“Go through them!”</p>
<p>I point at a few wolf riders and pray like hell the carriage can take a hit. Reynold hesitates—</p>
<p>And then I feel a hand grab the edge of the carriage. I jerk, but it’s no Goblin. Ressa pulls herself up as the carriage speeds along and shouts a word.</p>
<p>“<em>[Invisibility Field]!</em>”</p>
<p>Instantly, the world around us goes dark. I see runes on the carriage glowing, and the Goblins around us cry out, their eyes tracking the air where we were. I look around. Are we invisible? I can’t tell, but we must be. It’s as if someone’s put sunglasses on the world.</p>
<p>“That way.”</p>
<p>Ressa points and Reynold immediately turns the carriage, making a break for an opening in the ranks of Goblins and wolfriders. After a moment I hear more shouting, and look back to see pursuit has resumed. How…?</p>
<p>“The snow! They can see it!”</p>
<p>I shout and Ressa nods. The Goblins can indeed see the geysering snow from the carriage’s passage and they follow that. But the moment of hesitation has given us an opportunity. If we can just get ahead of them the carriage will easily outdistance their riders—</p>
<p>As we pass by more Goblins, I see something strange. A knot of huge Hobgoblins is dead ahead of us, and they’re turning, weapons raised and ready for us. Reynold takes us right past them, but then I spot something odd. In the center of the armed group of elites, a small Goblin is riding a wolf. And she has something in her hands. She raises a black crossbow, almost as big as she is, and points it at us. She can’t see us, surely. But she knows where we are. And she’s aiming—I shout.</p>
<p>“<em>Down!</em>”</p>
<p>The carriage swerves as I pull Reynold down and I see Ressa blur beside me. The crossbow bolt streaks towards the side of the carriage and <em>shatters</em> as it touches us. The bolt doesn’t break the magically-reinforced sides of the carriage—</p>
<p>But it does end the spell. The world goes bright again and I realize we’re visible. The Goblins shout and Reynold desperately flaps the reins to move us faster. I glance back at the Goblin with the crossbow—</p>
<p>And recognize her. Rags meets my shocked gaze for one second, and I see her own eyes widening. And then we’re past her in a blur of snow.</p>
<p>“We’re almost away, Miss Ressa!”</p>
<p>Reynold shouts in relief as the Goblins fall away behind us. Then he shouts in alarm as someone runs ahead of us. The tall Hobgoblin is streaking at us from the side, on a direct collision course as he rides his massive Carn Wolf. I hear Ressa mutter something from my side. I’m scrabbling at my belt for a potion, one of the bags—anything. But I’m too slow, and the tall Hobgoblin’s mouth is open in a roar as he holds a crimson sword over his head—</p>
<p>On the carriage beside me, Ressa stands up. Her hand <em>blurs</em>, and something flashes at the Hobgoblin. He jerks, and his sword deflects a flying object with a <em>ringing </em>sound. Ressa’s hands move again and the Hob snarls and jerks his reins. The Carn Wolf dodges away as five more black blurs fly at him. He strikes down each one, but while he does the carriage flies on. In a second we’re past him, and his howl of fury confirms that we are safe.</p>
<p>Then we’re gone. The Goblins racing after us stop as they become distant figures, and then just blips on the horizon. We race on through the snow, once again lost in a void of silence.</p>
<p>The three of us just sit on the front of the carriage, breathing hard. At least, Reynold and I am. Ressa is still sitting on the edge, still gripping the open door she came out of. Reynold’s hands are white on the reins and I’m wondering if I’m going to have a heart attack.</p>
<p>Gods. What just happened? Goblins, obviously. But so many? Where are they going? Was that <em>Rags,</em> Erin’s little friend!? And the other Hob—I could have sworn he was the one at the inn! What’s going on?</p>
<p>And Ressa? My head turns and I stare at her. She returns my look impassively.</p>
<p>“We’re safe now.”</p>
<p>That’s all she says. Slowly, she begins to pull herself back into the carriage, ignoring the wind ripping at her maid’s uniform. I call out to her.</p>
<p>“Wait! What was that?”</p>
<p>She just stares at me. And shrugs.</p>
<p>“My orders were to keep you safe.”</p>
<p>I point to her with a trembling hand. It was just a blur—hell, all of that was a blur. But I saw what she threw at the Hobgoblin.</p>
<p>“That was a <em>throwing star.</em> Are you—?”</p>
<p>Ressa slams the door to the carriage without a second word. I stare at the door. Oh my god. That can’t be true, can it? Is she a ninja mai—</p>
<p>Nah. I sit back with the [Butler] and shake my head. I’m going nuts. This entire thing is nuts. I’m nuts, I want to eat nuts—I’m shaking—</p>
<p>So is poor Reynold. His face is pale, although he still looks pretty damn composed for someone who just drove us through a Goblin army. More props to him, I guess. If this is how all British people are, no wonder they didn’t crack when they were getting the shit bombed out of them during World War II.</p>
<p>I’m generalizing. And panicking. I take a few more breaths of cold air to still my beating heart. That was—jeez.</p>
<p>After a minute I rap on the little window that connects us with the coach with a trembling hand. It doesn’t open.</p>
<p>“Hey. You in there. Pass us a bottle, will you?”</p>
<p>I shout it at Ressa and hear no response. But after a moment, the window slides open and one of the bottles of wine is handed through, bottom-first.</p>
<p>I pop the cork after six tries, and then drink from the top. It’s probably high-grade stuff I gulp down; I don’t even taste it. After I down a third of the bottle I nudge Reynold. He jumps and the carriage swerves; when he sees the bottle, he gratefully accepts it and drinks from it without a word.</p>
<p>We just sit in silence for a while, passing the bottle back and forth. After we finish it, I throw the bottle into the snow, ignoring every instinct in my body that tells me not to litter, and I get Ressa to pass us another one.</p>
<p>Reynold drinks, I drink. We stare at the landscape, and I look at the side of the carriage. The crossbow bolt didn’t even scratch the paintwork. God.</p>
<p>I want this carriage.</p>
<p>After I’m feeling a bit warmer and the cold sweat has mainly evaporated, I glance at Reynold. He’s got a bit of a flush as well. He’s just a [Butler], wearing a light grey jacket over his dark clothing. He’s holding the reins steady, guiding the magic horses forward.</p>
<p>“Is it always like this?”</p>
<p>He shudders, and shakes his head for a second before changing his mind and nodding weakly.</p>
<p>“Sometimes. On bad days.”</p>
<p>“Jeez.”</p>
<p>I sit back, and stare ahead. The world is white. It rushes past me with a roaring sound made faint by the carriage’s magic. I sigh, and look ahead. My friends and Goblins lie behind. And in the distance I see a faint shape on the horizon. Dark buildings, rising out of the ground as the light in the sky fades to nothing.</p>
<p>Invrisil, the City of Adventurers, awaits. And after that—</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia.</p>

		<p><strong>Day 31</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I wake up when I hear the crying. It isn’t Durene. She sleeps beside me, or rather, slightly apart from me on the floor of her cottage. Even though we’re close, we sleep a bit apart. Durene sometimes rolls over in her sleep, and I have no desire to be squished like a bug twice. Especially because she’s so hard to wake up when she’s in a deep sleep.</p>
<p>Cautiously, quietly, I roll out of my side of the bed, trying not to wake Durene. She needs her sleep, and if she knows I’m awake she’ll fuss over me and be too anxious to rest. I shiver as my shoulder touches the cold floor of Durene’s cottage. I briskly get up and grope around for my clothing, locating the undergarments and over garments I placed next to my head when I slept.</p>
<p>It’s harder than I’d like; I keep finding what I think is a coat and instead pulling up part of the warm blanket Durene and I were sharing. Part of the issue is that I can’t tell where clothing stops and Durene’s bed begins.</p>
<p>My friend and host Durene doesn’t have a proper bed; just a mattress made of soft blankets and pillows. I can understand why; she’d probably break any raised surface with her weight, and even a king-sized bed wouldn’t exactly be that big for her. Durene’s not a giant, but she <em>is</em> half-Troll, and that means she’s easily six foot six, or maybe even taller. I can only guess; I’m just over six foot myself, so I have to use that as a reference when measuring her.</p>
<p>Fully dressed but sock-less, I shiver as I pad around the room. Still cold, even with multiple layers. I feel at one of the windows and touch a wooden shutter, cold and frozen. Right. Durene has no glass.</p>
<p>But I don’t need to go outside to feel the cold emanating from the window. And the lovely little fire Durene made last night has gone out, even the embers. Winter is truly and deeply upon us.</p>
<p>Normally I wouldn’t care. I’d wake up later, and help Durene make breakfast. But today is different. I pause as I hunt for a sock and raise my head.</p>
<p>“There it is again.”</p>
<p>I whisper the words. Someone is crying. Not someone, actually. Something. I can tell it’s no person out there, but something animal. It’s shrieking. I think it’s a bird, but it sounds far different from any bird call I’ve heard back home. Far more anxious and…desperate.</p>
<p>Yes, a bird. But then, maybe I’m being too hasty here. I think it’s a bird, but given that I’m in a fantasy world, couldn’t it well be a bird person? Do they exist? I’ll have to ask Durene when she wakes up.</p>
<p>Regardless, this creature’s definitely in some distress to be broadcasting so loudly. I’ll be the first to admit I’m more sensitive to sounds than Durene, but this bird got me up even in the middle of my sleep. And it’s odd, but I have a very strong compulsion to go to it. And I even know where this…bird…is.</p>
<p>“Very odd.”</p>
<p>My socks are on, and my comfortable shoes are laced. I pause with my hand on the door, wondering what I’m doing. It’s snowy outside, and even though I have my walking cane in one hand, I know from experience how easy it is to get lost by myself.</p>
<p>But the creature calls out again, and I push open the door and walk outside before I can stop myself. After all, I can just retrace my steps if I go a short ways. It’s not that far—and I can shout for Durene.</p>
<p>All excuses, I know. But I have to follow this feeling. And so I silently close the door so as not to wake Durene and walk out into the snow.</p>
<p>It’s deep. I nearly stumble as I find it’s a foot deep. Jeez, winter here is <em>not</em> fun. And Durene’s told me it can snow far more before the season is over. I poke at the snow in front of me, but my cane’s no good in this weather. I make a disgusted noise, but still—</p>
<p>“A rock straight ahead?”</p>
<p>No. It’s just my imagination. But a few cautious steps forward and my cane pokes into the snow and finds—</p>
<p>A rock. Yes, a <em>rock.</em> Either that or some kind of fossilized vegetable. Nah, it’s a rock. But how did I know it was there?</p>
<p>Half a dozen explanations pop into my head, but I have no time to stop and consider them. The bird cries out again, and this time I can tell it’s from the ground, a little bit ahead of me and to the left, on the edge of the forest surrounding the cottage.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. I’m coming.”</p>
<p>No longer walking with my cane, I stride across the snowy ground with more confidence than I’ve felt in a long time. I know I’m walking straight through Durene’s frozen-over garden, and I also know what spots are slippery and even that she’s sown several crops for next year that are hibernating under the ice—and that there’s a cluster of turnips she forgot to pull up. I skirt her fence, walk towards a tree, and stop.</p>
<p>How did I just <em>do </em>that? It wasn’t sight—I’ve never seen in my life, but I know you’d use your eyes for that and I had mine shut the entire time. But I knew where everything was. Yet here I stop, at the edge of where my…perception of the landscape fades away. Yes, it’s as if there’s a large circle around Durene’s cottage I can sense, and then just emptiness past that.</p>
<p>And at the base of one tree, I can sense anxious movement, faint life. And my ears confirm that as I hear the creature cry out in alarm as I approach.</p>
<p>“What’s this, now?”</p>
<p>Broken branch. Twigs, bird poo, bones…the remains of a nest. And on the ground—</p>
<p>I reach out and something <em>pecks</em> at my hand. I yelp and draw my hand back, and the fledgling bird cries out again, calling for its parents. But if it had parents, it wouldn’t be alone. So, shivering, I come to a quick decision.</p>
<p>“None of that, now.”</p>
<p>The bird cries out in alarm and tries to get away, but it’s much too weak and cold. I briskly scoop it up and ignore its struggling. The bird pecks at me again, but this time he only gets my gloves. I walk back to Durene’s cottage, thinking hard all the while.</p>
<p>Birds fallen from nest? Doubtless. What happens to birds when that happens? I know the best thing to do is to put it back in the nest, but what if the parent is gone? Maybe it’s just independent?</p>
<p>No—I feel gently at the bird as it squawks anxiously again and amend my opinion. I don’t feel any feathers, only fuzz. This is no fledgling, a semi-adult bird. It’s a baby chick, or whatever the correct term is. I’m no bird watcher.</p>
<p>And two more things I note: the bird is quite big for a baby. And it’s also very cold. It’s shivering; how long was it out in the snow? I hurry up and push into the cottage.</p>
<p>A low growling sound makes the bird in my hands shut up instantly. I smile as I hear Durene snoring; she didn’t even notice me come back in. Well, she might have to wake up soon regardless.</p>
<p>First things first. I don’t bother hunting for anything; I just turn and grab a bowl out of Durene’s shelves. Once again, I know exactly which one will fit the bird, and in another second I’ve wrapped it gently in a towel, both to warm it and prevent it from escaping. The chick is trembling. No doubt it thinks I’m going to eat it.</p>
<p>Well, food <em>is</em> a good idea, both for me and it. I sense around, and find some bread. I slice some, again, with more confidence than I’d ever have normally, and offer some crumbled bits to the bird. It shies away from my hand, and then I feel a cautious <em>peck</em> at my bare skin. The bird finds a crumb, seems to taste it, and then spits the wet stuff back onto my hand.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p><em>That’s</em> odd. Don’t all birds like bread? I frown and try again. But this time the bird just <em>squawks</em> a bit as I try to push the crumbs at it, and it doesn’t touch them even when I leave some crumbs in the bowl for it.</p>
<p>“Drat. What kind of bird do you call yourself?”</p>
<p>I grumble at the bird as I move onto my alternate plan: getting this place warmed up. Durene’s stacked firewood in a corner, but up till this point I’d let her make the fire. I like to think I’m quite capable, but it really is a bad idea to have the blind guy messing around with flames.</p>
<p>But once again, I can quite definitely tell where things are, and even if I can’t<em> see</em> the position of the fireplace, I know where it is. Almost like…a memory? Or a fact. Either way, my hands are steady as I strike the flint and steel repeatedly and eventually manage to get some kindling to light.</p>
<p>“Fire, check.”</p>
<p>What’s next? I feed the flames a bit and fan them to make them brighter, or however it is that’s supposed to work. I guess if the bird won’t eat, I’ll get something. There are eggs in a basket Durene brought from the village, but I’d feel guilty eating them right at this moment. How about…hm?</p>
<p>Sausage?</p>
<p>Oh yes, there’s half a dried sausage in Durene’s pantry. I know she’s been saving it for a special occasion; meat is a luxury for her. I hesitate as I bring it out. Maybe just a bit? Fried sausage would be a <em>treat,</em> but can I…?</p>
<p>The chick suddenly squawks and kicks up a racket as I bring the sausage past it. I frown, stop, and clumsily tear off a bit of meat.</p>
<p>“You want this? Really?”</p>
<p>I know baby birds eat meat. I mean, they eat bugs. But I thought they liked seeds and plants more than—you know what? I’m not going to argue with the facts, especially when one fact is trying to tear the bit of meat out of my fingers.</p>
<p>The chick greedily devours the first bit of meat I feed it, then the next. Bemused, I find a knife and slice up a good portion of the sausage into bite-sized morsels to feed the chick. It scarfs the pieces down—so quickly and so fast that I’m worried I’ll overfeed it and make it sick! I stop after I’ve given it nearly a quarter of the sausage, but then the chick just cries out for more!</p>
<p>“Shush, you!”</p>
<p>It doesn’t listen to me. What a sound it makes! It’s more like a whistle than a cry. It sounds nothing like the twittering sparrows and occasional duck that will wander by my parent’s home. But it does sound familiar…</p>
<p>“Huh? Wuzzis?”</p>
<p>I lightly nudge the squalling chick with a knuckle.</p>
<p>“And now you’ve woken Durene. Good job, you.”</p>
<p>“Laken? What’s going on? Why are you awake and—<em>what’s that?</em>”</p>
<p>I turn and smile at Durene. Her confused voice and the way she clumsily makes her way over to me—these are the things that are now familiar to me. Funny, but after a month of living in her company I know her so well.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Durene. Sorry to wake you, but we have a guest.”</p>
<p>“Is that a bird? And…my sausage?”</p>
<p>Her voice is dismayed, but after a round of explanations she’s only too willing to help me make breakfast and play detective. The first thing she does is exclaim over the way I’m able to help her prepare today’s meal: a soup made of onions, leeks, peas, and cabbage. Pottage, in fact. It’s seasoned heavily with dried thyme and some garlic and it tastes not bad at all. True, it’s a poor meal to live on each day, but I’m happy enough eating it.</p>
<p>“How can you tell where everything is?”</p>
<p>Durene is bewildered as I nimbly pour soup into a bowl and bring it to the table, next to the restless chick. I shake my head, smiling fit to burst.</p>
<p>“I have no idea. It must be from my Class!”</p>
<p>“But how? I thought an [Emperor] ruled. Why can they see things? Without their eyes, I mean.”</p>
<p>“It’s not exactly the same.”</p>
<p>Cautiously, I spoon the hot soup into my mouth and think as I chew.</p>
<p>“It’s gotta be—I think we added too much thyme, Durene—it must be due to the fact that this is part of my domain. That is to say. My demesne.”</p>
<p>“Your—what?”</p>
<p>“Demesne. It’s another word for, well, land owned by someone. I know this is your cottage, Durene, but I claimed it when I became an [Emperor].”</p>
<p>“I know that. And I’m happy to let you, uh, have it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. But that means I own every part of the land, not just the cottage. The ground, the sky—that must be why I can sense where to go. Because it is mine.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>My friend’s voice is a sigh of wonder. A loud sigh, which makes the chick on the table next to me chirp in alarm. I sit up at the odd cry and frown again, tickled by that same thought.</p>
<p>“This is one weird bird, though. I can feel it, but I’m afraid that even with my new…abilities…I can’t really tell what it is. Durene, what does it look like?”</p>
<p>I hear Durene get up anxiously and pace around the chick. She comes nearer to me and apparently bends over, because the chick pecks her nose.</p>
<p>“Ow!”</p>
<p>“Careful. It’s pretty violent for a baby. It <em>is</em> a baby, right?”</p>
<p>“It looks like it. It’s one week—no, maybe two weeks old? But it’s really big…I thought it was a fledgling at first, but like you said, it has no feathers.”</p>
<p>“A big bird…”</p>
<p>Sesame Street? No, focus, Laken. But now that I think of it, there might actually be land bound birds as tall as Big Bird in this world. Now <em>there’s</em> a terrifying thought.</p>
<p>“What else do you see?”</p>
<p>“Um. Well—it’s got a weird color. Sort of—well, dark grey. Almost greenish.”</p>
<p>“Green fuzz?”</p>
<p>Doesn’t mean much to me, although I don’t know any green birds. But chicks don’t look anything like their adult forms.</p>
<p>“Well, I found it on the ground. I think the nest it was in fell off the branch. Maybe the parent’s still around and we can return it.”</p>
<p>I get up and Durene and I leave the chick behind to go investigate the spot where I found it. I feel…amazingly happy to be able to walk that short distance without my cane. There’s no trepidation, no sense of unease as I walk. I know where everything is, and I don’t have to hesitate.</p>
<p>Thank you. I don’t know who or what brought me here, but just for a little while longer, can you let me feel like a—a normal person? Is this what it feels like? To walk and know that the ground is <em>there</em> and I am <em>here?</em></p>
<p>Then I come up to that blank spot where the world ends, and Durene gasps as she sees the nest.</p>
<p>“Bones! Look at all the tiny bones, Laken! And over there—oh no.”</p>
<p>She sees something past the spot I can sense and walks over. I wait, trying to piece together my own sensory inputs. I can tell there are bones in the nest, but I didn’t focus on the size until now. There’s still a difference between what Durene sees and what I comprehend.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I…found the parent, Laken. It—she? She’s dead.”</p>
<p>Durene comes back, holding a dead bird in her hands. I blink as it comes into my zone and I register the <em>size</em> of the bird. It’s almost a third as tall as I am!</p>
<p>“That’s no sparrow.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Half-troll she might be, but Durene has a heart that weeps for everything. She sounds upset as she tells me how it died.</p>
<p>“It must have died of the cold. See here—oh, sorry Laken. It was fighting something, but it got hurt bad. It was bleeding, and it must have lost all its warmth when it got cold.”</p>
<p>“I get it.”</p>
<p>I sigh as Durene and I pause, unexpectedly sad over the death of this bird. I’m about to ask if we should bury it, when I sense Durene plucking feathers off the corpse.</p>
<p>“…What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Oh—I thought we could eat it later. It’s still cold and nothing’s been chewing on it, so—”</p>
<p>Oh. Ah. Hm. Well, I’ve heard of people eating road kill, and at least the bird was well-preserved. Maybe I’ll let Durene have it, although I could use some meat myself…</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s put that aside for now. What about the nest? You say there are bones here, right? Little ones?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. They’re very small, but…I don’t know how any predator would have eaten the others and left the chick you found alive.”</p>
<p>“No, it wouldn’t do that.”</p>
<p>My mind jumps to an unfortunate conclusion. I bent down and touch at the bones with one gloveless hand. Yup. They’re picked clean.</p>
<p>“A predator didn’t kill the other babies. The chick did. It ate its brothers and sisters to survive.”</p>
<p>An unhappy sound. Durene didn’t want to come to that conclusion, but it’s the only one that makes sense. I straighten and sigh.</p>
<p>“Nature at its best. But I think I have a good idea who this mystery bird is. It’s an eagle, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“I think so. It could be a hawk—I’m not a [Hunter] so I can’t tell the difference. But it looks like one of the birds that sometimes tries to swoop down and carry off a lamb, baby piglets, and so on.”</p>
<p>“Carry off lambs? Seriously?”</p>
<p>I’d heard stories of eagles trying to carry off kids, but I thought that was just a popular myth. But Durene sounds serious.</p>
<p>“Oh yes. [Herders] and [Farmers] have to be careful. An eagle can swoop down and fly away with a lamb in seconds if they don’t keep an eye out. Normally we try to get people with bows to shoot the eagle first, but it’s hard unless someone’s got a high level.”</p>
<p>“Well, this baby eagle—I think they’re called eaglets, actually—isn’t going to be carrying off anything anytime soon. I think now’s the moment when we make a choice, Durene.”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>She sounds apprehensive. I make a rueful expression, or what I’ve been told is rueful.</p>
<p>“About whether we keep it or not.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean—we’d throw it out in the cold?”</p>
<p>She sounds horrified. I guess I’ve got my answer. We walk back to her cottage. Durene pauses to bury the dead bird in the snow rather than bring it inside and show the chick.</p>
<p>“I’m just thinking about the problems. A baby eagle needs attention, food—the attention bit’s not so hard, but I’m pretty sure it only eats meat.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>“Oh indeed.”</p>
<p>Here’s why this is a problem in this world. In mine, the biggest obstacle would be getting a permit to raise a baby eagle—they’re considered illegal to own in the United States, and I suspect other countries wouldn’t be too hot on them as a pet either. Housing would be another problem I guess, and training—</p>
<p>But here, meat is the issue. There’s not exactly a supermarket around here, and Durene’s not rich. I am, but Riverfarm isn’t, so I don’t know how far the gold coins I dug up would go down there anyways.</p>
<p>“I think we should take care of him.”</p>
<p>Durene’s voice interrupts me. I can tell she’s practically wringing her hands, and her voice is anxious.</p>
<p>“If we need to, I can get meat. I could try setting a trap or hunting. And I—I have pigs!”</p>
<p>It’s funny how she cares more for a chick I found than the pigs she’s raised for years. Then again, she must have to force herself to look at the pigs as food. I nod as I pick up the upset little bird and it pecks at my hands.</p>
<p>“Okay then. Hopefully it won’t come to that.”</p>
<p>“Do you really think we’ll be able to raise him?”</p>
<p>There’s a glimmer of hope in her tone. As it so often happens, I realize that this is something Durene might have dreamed about but could never realize. A pet. It sounds so simple, but for her, it might just have been a dream.</p>
<p>“We can try. But I have to warn you, Durene. The chick might die no matter what we do.”</p>
<p>“Oh no.”</p>
<p>Durene already sounds heartbroken as she hovers around the bird in my hands. I find her arm with a hand and pat it gently. But I don’t give her false hope. I’m under no illusions; I don’t know how to raise birds, and this young one was born too late. Or maybe birds in this world can’t tell when winter is about to arrive thanks to those…Winter Sprites, and so they can only hope.</p>
<p>With those thoughts in mind, I find myself constructing a more permanent nest for the chick. And that’s with the understanding that this nest isn’t going to be reused; the chick has already pooped quite extensively in Durene’s bowl.</p>
<p>“It should probably be pretty big. Yes—that’s about right.”</p>
<p>I smile to myself as Durene fusses over the chick, holding it gently and exclaiming as it pecks at her hands.</p>
<p>“Does it…have a name?”</p>
<p>“Not yet. Would you like to name it, Durene?”</p>
<p>“Oh—I couldn’t. Why don’t you, Laken? You found it, anyways.”</p>
<p>I nod and take the chick from Durene, it struggles a bit in my grip, but I have a good hold over its growing wings. I stare down at it and think for a second. And perhaps it’s another bit of whimsy, but I decide that if I’m going to take care of this bird, I might as well do it properly.</p>
<p>Straightening my back, I place the chick on the new nest, and put my hand solemnly on its head. It doesn’t move about much; I make my voice deeper as I speak to Durene and the world at large.</p>
<p>“It’s not often that I find a baby bird lying on the ground. But since you’re here and your mother—or father—is gone, it falls to me to take care of you. You—chick.”</p>
<p>The little bird pecks at the bottom of my hand.</p>
<p>“Stop that.”</p>
<p>Durene giggles. I smile, and think for a moment.</p>
<p>“Well then, I think I’ll name you Frostwing, because that sounds quite appropriate for a bird in a fantasy world. It sounds a bit silly, but maybe you’ll grow into it. And I accept you into my small empire as one of my loyal, if noisy, subjects.”</p>
<p>The bird goes still for a second, and then I sense it rustling under my hand. Durene makes cooing sounds of delight.</p>
<p>“Aw! It’s grooming itself, Laken!”</p>
<p>“I’ll take that as a ‘yes’. Okay, let’s finish this nest and figure out where it’s going to sleep. I don’t want it wandering off during the night.”</p>
<p>“Okay!”</p>
<p>And there we have it. Another little addition to the cottage. I’m not sure if I regret it; little Frostwing pecks at my fingers and it eats and defecates a bit too much for my comfort. It has a very sharp, curved beak. Plus, it has a rather shrill cry that can get on the nerves—</p>
<p>And yet, I can’t see any other way this encounter could have gone. Would I have left it there to die? No. There’s no way I would have. And I have to wonder as I go to sleep, Frostwing resting in its new nest in the kitchen. I have to wonder if it was like that for Durene with me. Perhaps I was a little bird she found in the forest. The thought makes me smile as I close my eyes and sleep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Emperor Level 5!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Beast Tamer Obtained!]</p>
<p>[Beast Tamer Level 1!]</p>
<p>[Skill – Lesser Bond: Frostwing obtained!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“…Oh you have got to be kidding me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 32</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is leveling up so easy? No, before that, why is gaining a new class so easy?</p>
<p>This is the thought that circles around in my head, nudging my brain every once in a while. I don’t really have the brain cells to allocate to the issue though; I’m so sleep deprived that I can barely think straight.</p>
<p>It’s been a long night, and a longer morning. Durene is asleep, and I’m on bird-feeding duty. Again. As it turns out, Frostwing, the noisy little eaglet, apparently needs to be fed on an hourly basis. Or at least that’s how it felt last night. And since Durene isn’t as nimble as I am, it fell to me to get out of the warm, comfortable bed and feed the squalling creature while avoiding its sharp beak.</p>
<p>Do I regret all of this? Yes and no. The class helps. It really does. Because now I can wonder—what does ‘lesser bond’ mean? What’s the benefit of this class? Will it just aid me in raising Frostwing? Or are there applicable benefits?</p>
<p>Right now the only benefit I can feel is knowing how much to feed Frostwing. It’s like intuition—I can tell if the bird needs another morsel, or if feeding it—her too much would result in her puking up her meal. That’s valuable info, as is her gender.</p>
<p>I can’t tell with my [Emperor] senses, and I’m not about to go probing with my fingers. But Durene checked, and this bird is indeed a female one. Good for her.</p>
<p>But back to my class. I get the [Beastmaster] class. It only makes sense that I’d get it. But why did I level up as an [Emperor]? Let’s think about that.</p>
<p>I poke Frostwing as she tears at a bit of meat. She pecks my finger. I rub at an eye and frown.</p>
<p>Intent. Intent and purpose. I was fully committed to keeping the eaglet—Frostwing alive. Not only that; I fulfilled some criteria for the [Emperor] class. It makes sense that gaining exp for an [Emperor] would involve growing my kingdom and recruiting new subjects somehow.</p>
<p>But seriously? One baby eagle is worth a level in [Emperor]? No—no, wait a second. Maybe it’s not just numbers, but something else. Durene was my first vassal, but she came with the class. This is the first time I’ve declared my sovereignty over another being, and after I’d rescued them from death within my sovereign territory, no less.</p>
<p>That’s the only explanation I can come up with. How confusing. If only there were an instruction manual, or a wiki page or something I could use. But assuming this is a game, or something similar, the fun would be in finding how the rules work. And exploiting any secrets you can find.</p>
<p><em>Poke. Peck. Poke. Peck.</em></p>
<p>I keep baiting Frostwing, letting her strike at my finger and pulling it away before she can tag me. It’s, well, pretty fun, although getting pecked isn’t. But it must be fun, because before I know it, Durene’s awake.</p>
<p>“Laken! Is your finger bleeding?”</p>
<p>“So it is. I guess I must have got lost in playing.”</p>
<p>“For how <em>long?</em>”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure. Hours? I fed her twice.”</p>
<p>“<em>Twice?</em>”</p>
<p>I’m not good with sleep deprivation. Not that I think anyone’s exactly proficient in that area. Once I’m more awake and I’ve had a cup of tea—and what I wouldn’t give for an espresso—Durene and I get about the business of business. We don’t always stay in the cottage, although it’s a tempting option in this cold weather.</p>
<p>Our goal for today is actually quite simple: in lieu of the practically gone sausage, Durene and I have to find something for Frostwing to eat. She doesn’t want to butcher one of her pigs and I can’t blame her. They’re not fully grown yet, and it would be a terrible waste, even if she and I eat some of it.</p>
<p>Plus, I don’t quite have the heart for it. What I do have the heart for, and what came to me as I was feeding Frostwing a bit more sausage was that my [Emperor] senses can be used for more than just navigation.</p>
<p>“Right here.”</p>
<p>I whisper to Durene as we stand next to a tree trunk. She’s silent for a second.</p>
<p>“Found it. It’s a small hole.”</p>
<p>“Want me to—?”</p>
<p>“No. I’ve got it.”</p>
<p>Durene takes a deep breath, and then I hear her reach into the hole in the tree trunk. There’s alarmed chattering and frantic movement as her hand enter the squirrel’s nest, then—</p>
<p>“Got one.”</p>
<p>I <em>heard</em> the crunch. I feel a bit sick, but I know it’s not over. There are—were—three squirrels nesting in the tree that I sensed. Durene grimly catches the other two and swiftly snaps their necks.</p>
<p>“It’s done, Laken. I’ll pull them out if you can hold them—”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>She might not like killing creatures, but she’s efficient when she does. I hold the surprisingly heavy creatures, wincing as I feel their dangling necks.</p>
<p>“I feel bad.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>It was an idea. If I can sense Frostwing, what about other creatures? Turns out I can at least find squirrel dens, if I concentrate. Is this fair? No. But we’re out of meat and Frostwing needs a meal. So this has to be done.</p>
<p>Once we’re finished, Durene and I walk back to the cottage. She actually took the acorns the squirrels had been hoarding as well; they can be ground up. Durene doesn’t waste any food.&nbsp; Then we’re in the kitchen, Frostwing cheeping with excitement. Three squirrels are ready to be skinned in moments, and I have to help with that grisly business. It wouldn’t be right otherwise.</p>
<p>“Um—I—I think we’ve got to—with the head—”</p>
<p>“I’ll do it.”</p>
<p>It’s grisly, and it involves sawing and hacking, neither of us being proficient in preparing animals. Durene is no hunter, and if she does find animals, she generally has someone in the village help her prepare it for a share of the food. She didn’t even manage to bring herself to eat Frostwing’s mother—after some debate we buried her half-plucked corpse just outside the garden.</p>
<p>At least I can’t see what I’m doing. Durene assures me that in this case, this is a good thing. Mind you, I don’t like the <em>squishing</em> and the—rest. But I’m not the one who has to stumble out of the cottage for a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>“Durene? I think I’m done.”</p>
<p>Quietly, Durene takes the fur and other inedible bits outside. I can tell she’s burying the pieces. She’s a bit snuffly when she comes back in, but determined to put a brave face on it.</p>
<p>“At least Frostwing gets to eat. That’s—it’s for her.”</p>
<p>I nod. The chick is already demanding a bloody piece of meat, and we can freeze the rest although we’ll have to watch out for scavengers. Hell, we could probably kill them.</p>
<p>Durene shudders a bit as I put the meat into a bowl. I clean my hands with water after I feed Frostwing and then go over to her.</p>
<p>“Did they bite your hand?”</p>
<p>“A bit. But—it’s fine. My skin’s tough and I did far worse to them.”</p>
<p>She sounds unhappy. And guilty. Carefully, I hold her hands, making sure they’re unharmed for myself. Thick skin. But such a terribly soft heart.</p>
<p>“You’re a gentle soul.”</p>
<p>I kiss Durene gently on the cheek. She blushes—I can feel it. And then of course one thing leads to another. At least Frostwing doesn’t interrupt us more than once.</p>
<p>What? It’s not like it’s hard to figure out what people in this world do in the winter. And Durene and I are new at this. But kissing her I could do forever. I could sit and talk with her long into the night. And I do. Other things happen of course, but sometimes it’s just worth sitting by someone you…</p>
<p>Love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Beast Tamer Level 2!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 34</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s funny. I’ve had pets, and it’s always flurry and new experiences those first few days. But after a while, even feeding an eaglet bloody pieces of meat you’ve butchered yourself gets normal.</p>
<p>That’s how I find myself sitting in the kitchen, playing poke-peck with Frostwing. I think she could use the exercise, and I myself have already gone for a brisk walk with Durene. But at this time of day I usually stay indoors while she works.</p>
<p>Yes, works. Durene’s job doesn’t end in the winter of course. In fact, there might even be more to do. She planted a number of crops that could be harvested in the winter, and aside from tending to them, she has to clear out snow every day as well. She also normally takes this time to fix up her cottage, repair any tools, and of course, chop firewood.</p>
<p>With me around I can at least fix her meals and help with some small-time repairs, but my job is mainly looking after the chick. I’m certainly not a [Lumberjack]. Truth be told, neither is Durene, but with her strength it doesn’t really matter. I asked her about it at one point; she has an old axe, but she claims she only uses it to hack up the tree when it’s felled. As to the felling, she says it’s easy.</p>
<p>“I mean, if it’s a small tree, I can just kick it or push it over.”</p>
<p>…So it sounds simple enough for her. At any rate, Durene gets paid a pittance for supplying Riverfarm village with firewood, so when she’s not with me and Frostwing, she’s out in the forest. Rather, I make her go. I’m now fully confident in myself thanks to my new Skill, and we can’t always be cramped together.</p>
<p>Not that that’s necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p>Anyways it’s just me and Frostwing, testing our reflexes. My attention’s completely focused on the game, until I feel a…sensation at the back of my mind and get distracted.</p>
<p>As I pull my finger back a bit too slowly, Frostwing hits me with a good peck and pierces my skin. I yelp and I hear what almost sounds like a cheep of apology from her. But I’m not paying attention to the bird. My head turns and I frown.</p>
<p>“Someone’s coming.”</p>
<p>By the time [Farmer] Prost stops outside the cottage, I’m already waiting for him, a smile on my lips. If he’s confused by my intuition, his voice doesn’t show any sign of it.</p>
<p>“Mister Laken, I’m glad to see you’re well this day.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad to meet you as well, Mister Prost. You’ll have to tell me if you’re well.”</p>
<p>A bit cold, I know. But I still remember how I last met the man. I hear a pause, and then a note of uncertainty in Prost’s voice.</p>
<p>“I’m well, Mister Laken. Thank you for asking.”</p>
<p>“And your wife? How is Yesel doing? And the kids?”</p>
<p>“All well, Mister Laken.”</p>
<p>Well, that’s enough pleasantries. I nod and smile again, cheerfully. And say nothing else. If he wants anything else he can just say it.</p>
<p>After another moment of uncertainty, Prost gets to the point.</p>
<p>“Not to be interrupting you, Mister Laken, but ah, I was wondering if I could have a word with you. About Durene.”</p>
<p>“Another word? Well, I suppose I have no choice but to hear you out. What’s wrong with Durene this time?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, sir. It’s just, well, I’d like to talk, that’s all.”</p>
<p>Oh? Talk? I see. I let Prost go on.</p>
<p>“Durene’s a good…girl. But she’s only a [Farmer], and I understand you’re not. She’s said as much when she came into the village a day ago. I’d hate to think she was getting involved with someone with other duties later on, if you understand me.”</p>
<p>Oh? Is it now ‘you’re too good for her’? What is with these people? My smile freezes a bit on my face. But I keep silent. Wait. Wait for him to keep going and then smack him in the face.</p>
<p>Metaphorically, of course.</p>
<p>“We, ah, understand—”</p>
<p>Now. I jump in, my voice as smooth as I can make it. Friendly. Open. I put honest confusion into my tone.</p>
<p>“Do excuse me, Mister Prost. I’m afraid I’m a bit off-balance. You see, I thought you were coming here for something else.”</p>
<p>“Oh? What’s that, Mister Laken?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s just that—and you may call me silly for thinking this—I was under the distinct impression that you were coming here to apologize.”</p>
<p>“Apologize…?”</p>
<p>“To Durene. For calling her a monster. Inhuman. A <em>freak.</em>”</p>
<p>I wish I could see his face. I can only tell the man is standing in front of me, but then I hear him shift in the snow. Uneasily.</p>
<p>“I, ah, regret the other day, Mister Laken. I do. But I only spoke the truth. It needed to be said. And even if Durene was—upset, it don’t change the facts. So I don’t think I need to say anything to anyone, if you understand me.”</p>
<p>Again I interrupt him. This time I don’t even try to keep the undertone of irritation and anger out of my voice.</p>
<p>“No, of course not. You’re a grown man and Durene’s only a young woman who looks up to you as an adult. Why should you apologize to her for telling the truth? Why should you feel guilty for hurting the feelings of a half-Troll? My mistake.”</p>
<p>Prost’s voice is rougher too, but he’s still determined to be polite. I wonder why? It’s not like I’d be able to beat him if he threw a punch. But maybe there’s more in him than just bigotry and prejudice. Maybe he knows I’m right.</p>
<p>“You seem to feel I should be talking to Durene, Mister Laken?”</p>
<p>“I would never tell a grown man what to do. But they’re so hard to find these days. No matter where <em>I </em>look, I can’t see any.”</p>
<p>Another shot, and I know it hits something. But Prost is a stubborn man, a farmer. He doesn’t roll over, he digs in and keeps going. Reasonable tone, conciliatory words. I can tell he wants me to agree with him, to give a bit. Not happening.</p>
<p>“Durene is—useful. Helpful. She cares, I know that Mister Laken. And we’re lucky to have her around some times. But she’s still a half-Troll. And that means she’s part monster. Not entirely Human. It makes us parents worry some nights. What can you say to that?”</p>
<p>Half-Troll. It’s as if all Durene is, is just a word. How can they not see? She is more than that. She’s a [Paladin]. What would he say if I mentioned that?</p>
<p>“She’s a person, Mister Prost. A person. Where I come from—well, some people judge others based on what they look like it’s true. But take it from a man who can’t see, there’s more than just sight that goes into people. If sight was all we judged by, why, wouldn’t I be as much of a—a monster as Durene?”</p>
<p>Pause. Did anything I said go through? I hear Prost move about in the snow again, and then he speaks.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to look at her and not be afraid, Mister Laken. Maybe if I had the courage to close my eyes I’d think differently when I spoke to her. But it’s hard to get past.”</p>
<p>“Hard, but necessary.”</p>
<p>“There’s some truth to what you say, sir. I know Durene and she’d never hurt a fly. Maybe—”</p>
<p>Maybe. Just maybe you’ve been wrong. I wait for more, but that’s it.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll give it some thought and let the others know what you’ve said. That’s all I can say, sir.”</p>
<p>“I’d appreciate that. And I will say that if one more person hints at Durene being not good enough or I hear that she’s a freak, I’ll start throwing things. And believe me, I have pretty good aim even if I can’t see.”</p>
<p>I could probably nail him with a snowball, at least around Durene’s cottage. But I won’t. He came here to talk to me about Durene, and I said my bit and he said his. If he changes, all for the better.</p>
<p>But Prost isn’t quite done. He stands there for a while longer, and I have the distinct feeling he’s looking me up and down. When he speaks next, he has that same odd note of respect in his voice. Why?</p>
<p>“You seem…taller, Mister Laken. Better than before, if you don’t mind me saying so.”</p>
<p>“Not at all. I’m glad I seem so healthy to you.”</p>
<p>Taller? What does he mean? But it’s clear Prost means more than just height. He’s about to leave when I hear Frostwing kicking up a fuss inside the cottage. Maybe she’s finally caught Prost’s scent, or she’s hungry again.</p>
<p>“What’s that sound?”</p>
<p>I shrug as Prost begins to sound nervous again.</p>
<p>“Oh, that? That’s a baby eagle I’m raising.”</p>
<p>“A baby—”</p>
<p>He chokes on the words.</p>
<p>“You’re just full of surprises, aren’t you Mister Laken? Where’d you find a baby eagle?”</p>
<p>“In the snow, just like everyone else.”</p>
<p>“And you’re going to raise it?”</p>
<p>“If I can keep trapping animals. Eagles only eat meat, which is sort of tough for me and Durene.”</p>
<p>I have a sudden thought.</p>
<p>“Say, Mister Prost, would you consider selling me some food? I’d be willing to pay you a good price for anything you can spare out of your larder.”</p>
<p>Prost sounds vaguely surprised at my offer. I guess he really only came up here to chat.</p>
<p>“Food, sir? I don’t know. It’s awfully dear at this time of year, and the harvest was good, but not so much that I’d want to let anything go for cheap.”</p>
<p>“How would a gold coin sound?”</p>
<p>An intake of breath. I wait patiently, face straight. Yes, I have quite a lot of money, don’t I? I’d nearly forgotten with Frostwing, but hey, if you’ve got it, why not spend it? And it’s not like I can eat gold.</p>
<p>Prost murmurs to himself in surprise. He seems to take for granted the fact that I have a gold coin—from what Durene says every family might have one gold coin’s worth in savings, but probably not more than that unless they work a more profitable job. It’s more hand-to-mouth around here.</p>
<p>“A gold coin? I’m not sure we can spare…”</p>
<p>“What about the other villagers? I don’t need much, but I’d like more eggs than Durene’s chickens provide, and I’d love to have enough meat to go round.”</p>
<p>“The villagers might ah, go for that. But a gold coin—at this time of year—well, I’d have to think about it.”</p>
<p>I nod seriously, as if I’m considering Prost’s words carefully. Then I rub my hand over my mouth as if in serious thought.</p>
<p>“How does this sound, then? One gold coin—for whatever dried meat, eggs, and so on you feel you can trade. If the rest of the village will add a bit from their stock, I’ll make it two gold coins. You can take the money, Mister Prost, and change it however you feel is right. And then you can bring me whatever my money’s worth.”</p>
<p>Credit to him, the other man’s voice sounds only slightly strangled as he replies.</p>
<p>“That’s—very generous of you, sir.”</p>
<p>I shrug, slightly.</p>
<p>“I have a bit of money saved up, and mouths to feed. And I’d like to repay Durene back for all the help she’s been to me. You understand that, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“I do indeed, sir. Well then, if you’re sure I’d happily accept.”</p>
<p>I hold out a hand, and Prost takes it and gives me a firm shake. His hand is callused and cold. Somehow rougher than Durene’s, even though she has harder skin.</p>
<p>“Give me one second to get the coin.”</p>
<p>I love my Skill. Instead of having to search around desperately for the bag of coins and money, I find it in an instant. Durene hid it behind a sack, as if there were thieves lurking around the cottage. Then again, I suppose it would have been bad if Prost had entered the cottage and seen the bag lying around.</p>
<p>I take two gold coins out and come back to Prost in less than ten seconds.</p>
<p>“You’re awfully fast for a blind man, if you don’t mind my saying so, Mister Laken.”</p>
<p>“Blind doesn’t mean slow, Mister Prost.”</p>
<p>“Of course not.”</p>
<p>I give him the heavy coins and he promises to bring some food the next day. I have the distinct feeling he’s going to take as much of a cut as he can before paying the other villagers, but that’s pretty much why I made the offer in the first place. And if it means food—all the better.</p>
<p>Trade negotiations for the Empire of Laken or perhaps the Blind Empire have been concluded. All that’s left is to wait for Durene and give her the good news. She’s astounded of course, and a bit worried.</p>
<p>“Isn’t spending that much money—”</p>
<p>“Please, Durene. I found this bag by accident and there’s a hundred times what I just spent in here, easily. If it means we can feed this greedy sack of feathers, I’m all for it.”</p>
<p>I poke at Frostwing again, noting that she still does not, in fact, have feathers. Durene makes a noise which could be in agreement.</p>
<p>“How do you think I did in bargaining with Prost, though? Did I pay him too much?”</p>
<p>Durene thinks about this for a second.</p>
<p>“A gold coin? That’s…fair? A big, big basket full of meat and food would probably be a gold coin. Two is expensive, but it <em>is</em> winter.”</p>
<p>“And it’s enough to provide for another mouth and us comfortably throughout the winter. The villagers are happy, and so are we.”</p>
<p>Durene nods, or at least, I feel her do something as I sit next to her, sharing the blanket.</p>
<p>“It’s just—that’s a lot of money, Laken. I’ve never even seen more than three gold coins at once, and that’s how much the [Merchant] that visited had.”</p>
<p>Three gold coins? That makes me smile, but sadly. I have a bag full of wealth beyond Durene’s imagination. And I? I have no sense of what it means to her. In a very real way, I don’t deserve it. But I will try to treat it seriously. After all, if I wasted the gift I was given, that would be even worse than not getting it at all.</p>
<p>“I think two gold coins is fine, Durene. We could use the food, and this way we’ll be able to eat more than just pottage every night. Moreover, it pays to be a bit generous, but not too much. Especially if they start asking how much money I have.”</p>
<p>Not that I think they’d risk Durene’s wrath. But the image of the angry mob haunts the back of my mind, and I think, Durene’s. Conversation sort of trails off after that, but I can’t help but feel it was a decent day’s work. Maybe Prost won’t change, but at the very least, I can pay him to feed us. That’s got to be worth something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Emperor Level 6!]</p>
<p>[Skill – Intimidating Glare obtained!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You have <em>got</em> to be kidding me.”</p>
<p>“Hmm…? Laken?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. Go back to sleep, Durene. And you too, Frostwing.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 38</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He did apologize to Durene, I think. I didn’t hear it myself, and reading between the lines of what Durene said, it was a briefer apology than I would have liked.</p>
<p>But it was something.</p>
<p>And we got the food! I think the basket containing the dried ham, eggs, cheeses, and other delicious goods was enough for Durene. I could practically hear her stomach growling as I took it from Prost. And by all accounts, the villagers were happy to give up some food for good coin. So we also earned a bit of goodwill. Score one for generosity.</p>
<p>Frostwing certainly appreciated the meat. She eats more day by day, and she’s bigger than she was before—substantially. I can feel her getting restless and moving about more, and I wonder how big she’ll get before she’s able to fly.</p>
<p>Moreover, why was her nest so low to the ground, and in a tree no less? I thought eagles made their roosts high up. There’s something about her—not to mention the fact that even after we’ve washed her, Durene says Frostwing’s fuzz is <em>definitely </em>green.</p>
<p>I don’t know. I’ll have to wait and see. I’ve managed to train Frostwing a bit—she now knows not to poop in the nest and instead do it in another bowl nearby. Plus, she’s stopped waking me up in my sleep! By this point, I’m a Level 4 [Beast Tamer], the product of much work and pecked fingers. No new Skills, but I consider my new friend a gift enough.</p>
<p>Durene’s out helping clear snow in the village, and I’m sitting outside, Frostwing huddled in a scarf on my lap. I’m not sure if that’s smart, but my bond with her will tell me when she’s too cold, and I don’t want her to just breathe stale air.</p>
<p>The air is crisp, but I’m warm and my stomach is full. It’s a nice day. And then I feel it. Something enters the area around the cottage, swooping in from high above. Not something—some<em>things.</em> I pause, warily, and Frostwing screeches in alarm. Then I hear the voice.</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Look! Look, sisters! I’ve found him! The one who rules over this small place!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What the—? Did I just hear a voice? I turn my head as I hear laughter and feel something flying around me! A bug? A…bird? No. It has a voice! But there’s no person standing around the cottage. I would feel it. Yet there is <em>something</em> in the air.</p>
<p>“Who’s there?”</p>
<p>Laughter. A voice that sounds like falling snow and pure ice rings out, up and to the left, as if the speaker is flying. She calls to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Can you not hear us, oh Emperor? We are here, Frost Faeries of the Winter Court to meet you! Are you not honored?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Frost Faeries?”</p>
<p>What’s going on? Are there really <em>faeries </em>flying around my head? My first instinct is to disbelieve, but my sensible brain overrides that.</p>
<p>Okay, faeries. Durene tells me there’s magic, so why not faeries? Wait, didn’t she mention that name to me—</p>
<p>“You’re Winter Sprites?”</p>
<p>More laughter from above me. Frostwing is squirming in my lap, making sounds of distress. I think she’s afraid of these Frost Faeries, and that makes <em>me</em> wary. Already I can remember legends of the <em>sidhe</em>, and how they can be very, very dangerous. I try to remember what to do.</p>
<p>Be polite, be courteous. Offer them hospitality? Don’t tell them my name or make promises.</p>
<p>I decide to roll with it. It’s probably the best thing to do, but I throw in some healthy skepticism just to be on the safe side.</p>
<p>“Greetings, faeries. If that’s who you really are.”</p>
<p>Above me, I hear a mix of voices speak at once, a few outraged, some intrigued and playful. My god, it does sound like they’re flying around me!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“You question us?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“He does! Look! He cannot see us, only hear us!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“He sees naught!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Aye, but he rules over this place nonetheless. Emperor of the Unseen!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s both terrifying and amazing. But when they mention that title I freeze in my seat.</p>
<p>“How do you know I called myself that?”</p>
<p>It was just a joke, said to Durene in the privacy of my cottage weeks ago. The faeries laugh and I feel something colder than freezing in front of my face. Is it right in front of me? I make no move.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“We heard your words. How could we not? Ye claimed this land to the world and all living in it!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heard my words? How?</p>
<p>“Well…I suppose I’m flattered that you’re taking such notice of me. But what do faeries have to do with me?”</p>
<p>A tinkling laugh, like icicles breaking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“We have come here to bear witness to you, of course!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Bear witness? Why?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Art thou not an [Emperor]?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The faerie makes it sound as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world. And I start to get it. Faeries, kings—they’re tied together, like how the faeries blessed Briar Rose in the original tale. And they’ve come to visit me?</p>
<p>“I’m honored, of course. But have you come to simply see and acknowledge me, or do you have some other reason? And shouldn’t you be bowing? I <em>am</em> an [Emperor].”</p>
<p>I’m playing a dangerous and probably stupid game. But the faerie in front of me laughs again, apparently taken with my boldness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Hah! We bow to no mortal sovereign. You may claim the land, but we are far more than mere dirt and plant. Your authority has no sway over we.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“And yet you acknowledge it exists.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Of course! What churls do you think we are?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“We came to bear witness!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“To see an Emperor of this small place!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“And because we had nothing better to do!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well then, it sounds to me like these faeries came here because they were bored. Which means they’re capricious. Better to get on their good side. But how? I don’t know if offering them food is any good—I’d have to make some, and all of Durene’s cooking utensils are made of iron.</p>
<p>“Well then, in the name of the Unseen Empire, I bid you welcome. You are all honored guests, although I regret that my master chef and seneschal is out chopping wood. Please, make yourselves at home.”</p>
<p>The faeries seem delighted at this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Oho!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“He is polite, this one! He knows how to treat us: with respect!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Not like those other fools!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder who they’re talking about. I sense the faeries flying lower, and inquire politely.</p>
<p>“Do you have any business here besides meeting me? I wouldn’t want to keep you from your duties.”</p>
<p>A chorus of denials greets me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Nae, we have time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Until the spring comes, we are free!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Free to do as we please, and not follow one stupid mortal!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Aye! So we came here to meet you! ‘Twas worth it to be greeted with respect.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another voice chimes in, high and excited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Plus, we wanted to see ye before it was too late.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Shh! Don’t tell him that!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Wait, <em>what?</em>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Idiot!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hear a light smack and I have to guess one of the faeries hit the other. I hold Frostwing in my hands, although she’s barely moving, heart suddenly beating out of my chest. Faeries. Beings that can see and predict fate.</p>
<p>“There’s something bad about to happen? Please, tell me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Well—”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Shh! Be <em>quiet!</em>”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“No. Forget what you heard, mortal!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The faeries flutter around me. They start arguing, and I hear a few of them saying they should tell me. But most of them are in favor of not. A few fly up, and I raise my voice desperately.</p>
<p>“Wait, hold on! I entreat you, please, stay and let us talk.”</p>
<p>A pause, and then I sense them flying close to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Very well. For your words of hospitality, we will listen. Speak, oh Emperor, Protector of Durene’s Cottage.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No time to laugh, and no time to question. I clear my throat.</p>
<p>“It seems to me that you…wise and noble faeries are aware of some impending danger to me and my empire that I am not aware of.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Perhaps.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Indeed, and I would <em>never</em> ask you to reveal a secret. But perhaps I could persuade you to help me avert the tragedy that is yet to come? Or at the very least, reveal the danger to me.”</p>
<p>The faeries murmur at this. I hold my breath—I’m trying to sound formal, but I have no idea how to actually talk to the fae. A bargain with them sounds like a bad idea, but this disaster—</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Intriguing. What do you propose, mortal?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yatzhee! I keep my face composed as I nod in what I hope is a dignified manner.</p>
<p>“Well, I cannot offer you land or a marriage to my house—”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“—Hah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Shh!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“—But what would you say to mortal riches? I have gold and jewels to compliment your radiance. Would you accept that?”</p>
<p>The faeries confer, whispering loudly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Mm…<em>maybe.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Hah! He seeks to flatter us. He calls us ‘radiant’, he who cannot see!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Ah, but we <em>are</em> radiant, are we not sisters? Any mortal can tell that, even without sight.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“True! But gold is so <em>heavy.</em> And it <em>is </em>a secret.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, they fly back down to me, probably shaking their tiny heads. I can only imagine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“No, oh Emperor. It is not enough. Mortal wealth has little luster for us. Have you nothing else to offer?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing. Damn it, nothing. Only a bit of food, and I can’t feed all of them! If only I had an actual empire. But my [Emperor] title is just for show. I can only—</p>
<p>Wait. Emperor. Empire. What about—</p>
<p>I clear my throat.</p>
<p>“What if I gave you a noble title?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Are you serious, mortal?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I? Yes.</p>
<p>“Only naturally. I would offer entrance into my noble court to any friend of my kingdom. You, for instance—”</p>
<p>I point in the direction of the voice of the faerie that just spoke.</p>
<p>“For your aid, would you accept a title? That of, say, Comtesse?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Ooh! I like that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“What about us?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I want to be a Comtesse!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Nay, I!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“We cannot all be Comtesses! What of the rest of us, mortal?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeez, do I have to bribe all of them? I think quickly.</p>
<p>“I could make you…<em>noblesse uterine</em> if you wanted.”</p>
<p>Not exactly a flattering name. The tiny voices confer, and then dissent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Nay! Another title!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Marchioness, then? Or—how about <em>Herzogin</em>?”</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Ooh! I like that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I want to be that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“No, me!”</span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>They’re like children, squabbling over titles I just made up. And yet—maybe there’s more to it than that. It might sound funny, but I am an Emperor, and I do have the power to make the nobility.</p>
<p>…Still, I can’t help but feel glad that no one’s watching me as I come outside and address one of the faeries who kneels in the air in front of me.</p>
<p>“Very well. I dub thee Comtesse of the Soup Spoon.”</p>
<p>So saying, I hand her a wooden spoon. The other faeries <em>ooh</em> and applaud, and the faerie seizes the spoon from my hand and crows in triumph. That position was heavily sought after, but the other titles are equally as important. I turn to the next faerie.</p>
<p>“If you would be a <em>Reichsgräfin</em> in my empire—”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Aye, I would!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Then I grant you that position for as long as my empire exists. To the end of time, an Emperor’s word on it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Hah! I will hold you to your word, mortal!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s what worries me. But I have no time to reflect on my actions. I go down the line of faeries. A Comtesse, several Ladies, a Duchess and a Viscount—I dub a score of them <em>Blumenritter,</em> and make one a Baron. I asked her if she wanted to be a Baroness, but she preferred Baron.</p>
<p>And then it’s over. I breathe out and feel the assembled peerage of my empire flying before me. I bow to them regally, and hear them laugh in delight. The sound warms my heart even in this chill, but I am still afraid.</p>
<p>“So now will you tell me what fate waits for my empire?”</p>
<p>The faeries pause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“We cannot say.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really? After all this? I only cross my arms and frown. The faeries hurry on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“We cannot! It is a secret and not our place to tell. But since ye have given us an Emperor’s gift, we shall return your kindness. I swear to you, oh mortal ruler, this fate shall not befall your land or your people.”</span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Is that a good thing or a bad thing? No—it’s good. And I know better than to question it. Instead, I nod my head regally.</p>
<p>“My thanks to you. You and your kind are welcome in my land. Know this.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Aye, and we shall treasure your gifts to us, mortal!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“You shall be safe, we promise!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“You aren’t bad—for an Emperor!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The faeries cry out as they laugh and fly away from me. I listen to them go, worried and relieved and happy in turns. Faeries. My god.</p>
<p>Durene finds me sitting in the snow, about an hour later. I hear her exclaim and then come running over.</p>
<p>“<em>Laken!</em> What’s wrong? Why are you out here? You’re so <em>cold!</em>”</p>
<p>I just laugh at her, which makes her even more confused and upset. I let her carry me inside and fuss over me. I barely know where to begin. How can I even explain what happened? I do my best, but she can hardly believe me herself. But there is one thing I now know, with dreadful certainty.</p>
<p>“Something bad is about to happen, Durene.”</p>
<p>It might avoid us, according to the faeries. But I cannot help but wonder and worry. It may be mortal folly, but I am mortal. And I worry. But that is only half of me. The other half wonders and dreams of magic.</p>
<p>I saw faeries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Emperor Level 7!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 41</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three days later it happened. I was just waking up, in that blissful moment between waking and sleeping. I was about to feed Frostwing some cold meat when I heard a <em>roar </em>like thunder. But unlike thunder, the sound did not diminish. Rather, it grew louder.</p>
<p>“<em>Durene!</em>”</p>
<p>Maybe I was expecting it. But the reality of the ground <em>shaking</em> around me and Durene’s pottery clattering and breaking on the shelves is far more horrific than anything I could have dreamed. I hear Frostwing screeching, and Durene shouting for me.</p>
<p>We meet in the center of the cottage as the rumbling oblivion of noise crescendos around us. It feels like the world is ending, and all I can do is hold Durene to me. I feel her squeezing me hard, and close my eyes.</p>
<p>And then, as quick as the terror has begun, it’s over. I open my eyes slowly, for the first time in ages. Of course I see nothing, but I do it all the same. It feels like I <em>should</em> see something, for the world has changed.</p>
<p>I know it, even if the cottage and the area around it that I can sense is the same. Durene is quivering in my arms. As she holds me and I hold her, I can hear Frostwing <em>shrieking</em> in alarm. At last I manage to let go of Durene and stagger up to her.</p>
<p>“Frostwing. Are you…?”</p>
<p>She’s alright. Just scared out of her wits. I check her with my hands just to be sure. They’re shaking. Then I hear Durene gasp.</p>
<p>“Durene. What is it?”</p>
<p>“The—the—”</p>
<p>She can’t even speak. I rush to her side, and feel her at the open door. But I can’t sense anything.</p>
<p>“Durene?”</p>
<p>“The <em>snow…</em>”</p>
<p>Her eyes see it. But it takes me a long time, an eternity, to coax her mouth into making sense for me. And then she speaks and I realize what’s happened.</p>
<p>The snow. The snow came down off of a distant mountain. The snow, triggered by snowfall of a sound or the faeries, turned into an avalanche that poured down, smashing everything in its way. It travelled miles, a vast distance, before expending the last of its energy here.</p>
<p>Even the last of its force is enough to destroy everything in its path. Trees were uprooted, a good swathe of the forest buried. But by some miracle—some magical help—the force of the avalanche split around the hut. Ours is the only unburied point as far as Durene can see.</p>
<p>“It’s a miracle.”</p>
<p>Durene hugs me again, shaking. I hug her back, even though I know that’s not entirely true. Not a miracle. A gift. Payment in kind.</p>
<p>I don’t know if I should thank the faeries or blame them. I settle for thanking them, and feel relief coursing through my veins. It’s over. We’re safe. If the faeries hadn’t diverted the avalanche, the cottage would have been buried or smashed to bits. I’m just glad we weren’t outside of the cottage or—</p>
<p>My heart stops in my chest. I realize with horror what must have happened. My sightless gaze turns to the road connecting Durene’s cottage with the rest of the world, now covered in snow.</p>
<p>“Oh no. The village.”</p>
<p>Durene gasps in horror. She lets go of me.</p>
<p>“It would’ve been right in the way of the avalanche! Laken, what should we do? We have to—do you think it missed them?”</p>
<p>No, no I don’t. I can just imagine what happened. The avalanche hit the village. I might’ve—the buildings are sturdy and this was the tail end of it. But what good is that against thousands of tons of snow?</p>
<p>Durene is panicking, and I’m rooted to one spot. We have to help. But how? It’s just me and Durene. Should I grab a shovel? No—food? What’s the best option? Where will the villagers go? Is it still dangerous there?</p>
<p>I don’t know what the right choice is here. I don’t know how to save the lives that might be at risk—or already gone.</p>
<p>Think, Laken. What can I <em>do?</em> What can we do?</p>
<p>What would an [Emperor] do?</p>

		<p>What do I do?</p>
<p>I’m no hero. I’m not even qualified to be a police officer, doctor, an emergency worker, or any job that requires sight.</p>
<p>And I’ve never been trained. I have no idea what to do.</p>
<p>So panic grips me as I stumble across the snowy ground, knees still shaking from the avalanche. Part of me doesn’t even really <em>believe</em> what’s happened. After all, the small area of land I can sense hasn’t changed much. But Durene tells me that everything around her cottage is just—gone.</p>
<p>‘I’ll have to see it to believe it.’ Ironic, but in my case I have to <em>feel</em> it, or at least hear it to believe. I walk to the edge of the place where the earth just fades away in my mind, and feel forwards.</p>
<p>Nothing. Well, it’s not as if there would be a wall of ice in front of me. But suddenly I notice the frozen pathway is gone. Instead, there’s only crunching snow underfoot. And as I walk forwards cautiously, feeling my way ahead, I start to stumble as I run into huge chunks of solid snow, torn up. And—dirt? I hit something hard and feel at it.</p>
<p>A tree trunk. Sideways. It’s lying on the ground.</p>
<p>“Oh no.”</p>
<p>It’s true. I trace my way to the base of the trunk—actually, it’s the top of the tree. I feel branches, and leaves. The avalanche pulled this tree up and tossed it like a twig. And if it could do this to a tree, what chance does a house stand?</p>
<p>The village. My mind goes back to it. What do I do? What <em>can</em> I do? I have to help; that’s the right choice. But what’s the best way? I don’t—</p>
<p>“<em>Laken!</em>”</p>
<p>A voice shouts my name and I hear thumping footsteps. Durene rushes after me, fright clear in her voice.</p>
<p>“It’s not safe!”</p>
<p>Rough hands drag me back. Durene is terrified, but she cares more about my safety in this moment than anything else. I let her pull me back into the radius of the cottage. There at least I can tell what’s around me. But instead of being reassured by my mastery of this small domain, I now feel like I’m holding a candle in a—a dark world. I don’t understand darkness that well, but I fear the place where my [Emperor]’s senses fade away and I have to rely solely on remaining senses.</p>
<p>The village. My heart is still pounding out of my chest. The world is too silent. I can hear thunder in my veins, but there is only silence in the air. Compared to the fury of a few seconds ago, this—</p>
<p>I hear shrieking. My head turns, but it’s only Frostwing. She’s scared out of her mind, and I can’t blame her. But her anxiety doesn’t matter—the village—</p>
<p>I can’t think. I’m hyperventilating, gasping for air. Durene trembles as she stops.</p>
<p>“Laken. What do we…? It’s all gone.”</p>
<p>We’re both in shock. I know that. But my mind keeps snapping back to the village. Riverfarm. They were hit. I have to do something.</p>
<p>And like that, the paralysis gripping me ends. It’s not that I’m not still petrified. But I start moving even so. I have to act. It’s either act or keep still, and there <em>is no time.</em></p>
<p>“Durene, we have to go to the village. The faeries didn’t protect Riverfarm. Who knows what’s happened to them?”</p>
<p>“What? Laken—”</p>
<p>Durene pauses. It’s not even complete thoughts she’s having. She’s not thinking, just reacting. But finally—and it feels like forever although it’s only been a minute or less—my brain begins working again.</p>
<p>Village. Help them. We have to go and check. Can’t stay here.</p>
<p>I feel cold. As if my skin and everything beneath it has frozen over. A chill made of fear is making me shake, but that same terror is electric. I don’t stop and think; I only know that I have to <em>move.</em></p>
<p>“We have to go! <em>Durene!</em>”</p>
<p>I snap at her. Durene jerks, and then she hesitates.</p>
<p>“It’s too dangerous for you! I’ll go. I’ll help. You stay here and—”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Laken—”</p>
<p>“You are a [Paladin].”</p>
<p>I feel like an idiot saying it, but I grab Durene’s protective hand and try to turn my head towards her face. My gentle giant is shivering with fear, but her being here reassures me enough to keep my voice steady.</p>
<p>“Durene. You are a Paladin. A protector of the weak and innocent. And you are also <em>my</em> guardian, my champion. You have to go. And I have to go. We have to help everyone we can.”</p>
<p>She hesitates, and then I feel a bit of strength return to her hand. She breathes in.</p>
<p>“Okay. Let’s go. I’ll clear a way. The road is—is gone. Follow me.”</p>
<p>She turns, and I hesitate. The village. What will we do there?</p>
<p>Think—it was an avalanche. Buried people, disaster area. Red Cross. Doctors Without Borders. What do they…?</p>
<p>“No—wait.”</p>
<p>Durene halts in bewilderment. I turn and point towards the cottage.</p>
<p>“A basket. We need all the food we can put in there, towels—clean fabric—um—”</p>
<p>I can’t think of anything else. Bandages, food, what else? The avalanche—</p>
<p>“A shovel.”</p>
<p>I run back towards the cottage, and Durene rushes into her tool shed for a shovel. I push open the door and hear Frostwing screaming at me. She’s tumbled out of her nest, but fortunately she’s okay. I scoop her up and put her and the nest on the floor. I talk to her as I scramble around the cottage, using the clear image of the cottage in my head to pick up everything we might need.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. It’s okay—shush! We’ll be back, okay?”</p>
<p>To my surprise, the eaglet shuts up. I don’t have time to dwell on that though—six more seconds and I’m kicking the door open. Durene grabs the food and cloth spilling out of my arms and stuffs it into a huge basket she uses to collect produce.</p>
<p>“Okay. Let’s go!”</p>
<p>I lead us both away from the cottage. It’s so easy to move around Durene’s cottage. I’ve seldom ever run—being blind means I’m used to running into things, and I know that I can seriously injure myself running into something sharp at high speed. But in this place I’m sure-footed, and I force my unaccustomed legs to move faster. Durene is right behind me, carrying the basket.</p>
<p>Two steps outside of the circle and I falter. The world disappears around me, my sense of it returning to nothing. It wouldn’t have bothered me, before. But it’s like going deaf or losing my sense of smell. Or going blind, I suppose. The new sense I had is gone, and I suddenly realize how inconvenient it is not to have it.</p>
<p>I stumble, and a hand catches me.</p>
<p>“This way. Follow me.”</p>
<p>I take hold of the bottom of Durene’s shirt and begin to follow her. That’s easy—I’ve done that countless times before. But this time, the landscape is totally different.</p>
<p>“So much snow…”</p>
<p>I can feel Durene’s shirt straining as she grunts and pushes ahead. The snow around my ankles rises and shifts, and as I follow in her steps I realize that the snow rapidly becomes waist-deep in places.</p>
<p>No time to stop and think. I try to follow directly in Durene’s footsteps. But even then, the snow is already filling in her steps, and I can’t tell what’s in front of me.</p>
<p>The snow is so <em>deep! </em>Durene wades through it, but I can’t. The second time I trip, something grabs my legs and back, pulling me off my feet. I jerk in surprise, but Durene lifts me into her arms, cradling me with ease.</p>
<p>“I’ll—carry you, Laken. It’s faster that way.”</p>
<p>My mouth opens to object. I’m not a child. But then I close my mouth instead. She’s right. Even if I had sight, this is probably faster.</p>
<p>“I’ll hold the basket. Give it to me.”</p>
<p>I hold the basket on my stomach as Durene carries me in her arms. It is <em>not</em> comfortable, especially since Durene’s running means I bounce around like a rag doll. But she moves far faster than I can, so I hang on to her with all my strength as I feel cold air blowing past my face.</p>
<p>Powdery flecks of ice keep hitting me. Durene is churning through the snow as if it’s not there. I can hear her breathing hard, but she doesn’t stop running.</p>
<p>Riverfarm is about ten minutes away from Durene’s cottage at walking speed. We get there in four minutes. My first instinct when Durene puts me down is to find the wounded. But my weak imagination isn’t enough to predict the reality of what awaits us.</p>
<p>For a few seconds after Durene puts me on the uneven earth, she can’t even speak. When she eventually finds her tongue, it’s still almost too much for her. She describes the scene for me, breathless. Horrified.</p>
<p>Riverfarm is <em>gone. </em>The avalanche poured through the tiny community in one horrific rush. The pounding snow covered entire houses and knocked the walls in on others. There’s so much packed snow that we’re standing several feet <em>above</em> where the ground is supposed to be.</p>
<p>“I can see the roof of Mister Prost’s house from here. It—oh, Laken! It’s all gone!”</p>
<p>“What about the people, Durene? Are they alive?”</p>
<p>I grab Durene’s arm, trying to keep her focused. My voice is urgent, and she starts as if coming out of a trance.</p>
<p>“A few. I can see some, but—”</p>
<p>Some of them are just standing around, motionless. Others wander aimlessly, and I can hear them calling. A few are trying to dig at the ground, but the snow isn’t loose. It’s been packed, and everything is buried. How would they even know where their families and friends are?</p>
<p>And no one’s really that coherent in the first place. Durene is experiencing it and so am I, to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>Shock. But I know—I have to fight through it. I can’t see, but I wasn’t caught up in that maelstrom of death. My head is the clearest right now.</p>
<p>“We have to start digging people out. Durene, where’s the nearest house?”</p>
<p>Again, Durene starts as if I’m waking her from a dream.</p>
<p>“Nearest? Over there—Mister Ballus and Miss Ven’s—”</p>
<p>“Let’s go to it.”</p>
<p>I push at her, and Durene moves forwards. I follow her until she stops.</p>
<p>“What does it look like? Do you see any of the family around here?”</p>
<p>“No—I—I don’t know. They could be over there. That looks like—it’s all buried, Laken. All of it.”</p>
<p>“How much is buried? The front? The back? Could we dig the door out—maybe they’re still inside?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. It’s <em>buried.</em>”</p>
<p>I clench my teeth in frustration. I can’t see, and Durene isn’t being helpful. I want to shout at her, but in the next instant I feel her moving.</p>
<p>“I’ll dig! Stand back, Laken!”</p>
<p>I take the basket and move back. At once I feel snow flying through the air and hear Durene grunting. Suddenly she’s all motion, and I hear her shouting, the first loud sound in the shocked silence of the village.</p>
<p>“Mister Ballus! Miss Ven! Cinney! Rober! Are you there!?”</p>
<p>The noise does something to the villagers not buried by the snow. After a few seconds I hear movement, and then someone runs over.</p>
<p>“<em>Durene!?</em> And – Mister Laken? You two are alive?”</p>
<p>“We are.”</p>
<p>I don’t recognize the name, but I feel someone rush over to me. A hand seizes mine, rough and callused.</p>
<p>“It’s me, Prost.”</p>
<p>“Mister Prost? Are you okay? Where’s your family?”</p>
<p>“I don’t see them. <em>I don’t—</em>”</p>
<p>Prost is trembling even worse than Durene was. He can barely hold on to me, but that he does, clutching at me like he’s holding on for dear life. I try to calm him down.</p>
<p>“Mister Prost. Listen to me. We have to start digging people out. Durene’s got a shovel. Can you help her? Find other people…?”</p>
<p>We need to get a group of people assembled. Even with Durene’s strength, every house in the village is drowned in snow. Prost nods, and then realizes I can’t see the motion even though I feel him doing it.</p>
<p>“I can do that. But—Durene! My house is over there!”</p>
<p>“Mister Prost?”</p>
<p>I feel the man let go, and then hear Durene’s voice. The sound of the shovel scraping the snow stops.</p>
<p>“My family—they were all inside when the avalanche hit! Help me dig them out!”</p>
<p>“But Mister Ballus and his family are—”</p>
<p>Oh no. I hear the two’s voices raised, and then it sounds like Prost tries to grab the shovel out of Durene’s hand. When that doesn’t work, he tries to drag her with him with the same amount of success.</p>
<p>“Please, you have to help. They’re trapped! I need—”</p>
<p>“<em>Durene!</em>”</p>
<p>This voice isn’t from a man. It’s female and cracks in desperation. I hear more running and then another villager is fighting with Prost for Durene’s attention.</p>
<p>“<em>Durene!</em>”</p>
<p>“Help me! My husband—”</p>
<p>“Help <em>us!</em>”</p>
<p>I can see nothing, but I don’t have to see to know that Prost shoves the other woman away. I hear her cry out, and then Durene’s voice.</p>
<p>“Stop fighting! Please! I’ll try to get everyone out. But if you could help me—”</p>
<p>“My family! Save them first!”</p>
<p>No, no, <em>no! </em>But I know even as the voices raise what’s going to happen. The villagers were still shocked when Durene and I arrived. But now that we’ve started moving, the confusion gripping the villagers has faded a bit.</p>
<p>But that only means they’re now desperate, and Durene is the only person that can help them. More people rush to her, an uninjured beacon of hope. But instead of working together, they begin fighting over her!</p>
<p>“Everyone! Please listen! We need to work together!”</p>
<p>I call out, shouting at them, but I can’t see a thing, and Durene is now trapped by the desperate men and women. They’re arguing, not listening to anything. And instantly, a scuffle begins. I even hear what sounds like a blow. Are they <em>hitting </em>each other? But it’s every villager for themselves.</p>
<p>“<em>Listen to me!</em>”</p>
<p>I shout desperately and even try to run towards the fight, but all that gets me is a hard shove as someone knocks me down. I fall onto the ice and hear a scream.</p>
<p>“Laken!”</p>
<p>Someone else shrieks, and then I hear the voice moving away. Durene runs towards me. She—<em>threw</em> a villager out of the way. They scatter as she anxiously helps me up.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“I am—but this is insanity, Durene!”</p>
<p>I’m already on my feet. But the sounds of chaos haven’t faded. If anything, they’ve gotten worse. Now the people are fighting over Durene’s shovel. She’s helpless as she looks at the scene and I try to make sense of it all.</p>
<p>“No one’s listening! What should I do, Laken?”</p>
<p>I don’t know. This is a nightmare—two nightmares at the same time! We need order, but no one’s listening. And I have no idea where the buried villagers are, or even how many are still alive. I yell at Durene.</p>
<p>“Just—just start digging! Try to get this house out first. We have to—”</p>
<p>What can I do? Nothing. I could dig, but I have no idea where everything is. And Durene’s the only person with any kind of tool! She moves into action, running back towards the building and I cup my hands to my mouth and shout.</p>
<p>But it does no good. No one will listen to me. Eventually, the fighting villagers stop and return to trying to dig their loved ones out. One helps Durene, and others try to get their friends to work together, but there’s no cohesion. And again, there’s only one shovel and the ice is like stone in places. And no one knows where any of the victims are!</p>
<p>We’re running out of time. People are suffocating down there. I try to think. What can I do? What can any of us do?</p>
<p>What if—I could see? I can’t, but what about my Skill? Yes, that’s right! I saw Durene’s cottage, and even the buried plants in the garden. What if—</p>
<p>I take a few deep breaths. No one is looking at me and Durene is still shouting as she digs. I don’t know what to do exactly, so I point to what the center of the village is. I try to put conviction into my words as I speak.</p>
<p>“I claim this village.”</p>
<p>Nothing happens. Of course not. Would it really be that simple? But then what do I do?</p>
<p>“I claim this village—in the name of [Emperor] Laken!”</p>
<p>“…This village is a Protectorate of the Unseen Empire!”</p>
<p>Nothing. I feel like the biggest fool in the world, and all around me people are screaming, calling for help. <em>Dying.</em></p>
<p>I have to do something. And this is it. Why can’t I claim this village? I could do it with Durene’s cottage. Think. Why?</p>
<p>Because she <em>let</em> me. Because she gave me the authority to do it. Instantly, I realize what I have to do.</p>
<p>“Durene? <em>Durene?</em>”</p>
<p>She’s by my side in an instant.</p>
<p>“What is it, Laken?”</p>
<p>“Where’s the village head?”</p>
<p>I know this village has its own mayor, or leader or something. It’s not a very important position—the villagers choose someone every year, but only to negotiate with other villagers, towns, and traders. But it is a leader.</p>
<p>“What? Mister Till? I don’t know. I don’t see him…”</p>
<p>“I need to find him. Or his family. Do you see anyone who knows where he might be?”</p>
<p>“N—I do! I see his wife!”</p>
<p>“Take me to her. Hurry!”</p>
<p>Durene abandons her efforts and leads me across the uneven ground. I keep stumbling, and at one point I hear a shout and feel the packed snow <em>shifting </em>underneath me.</p>
<p>“God.”</p>
<p>Is this what it’s like after an earthquake? I hear stories of natural disasters, but this—</p>
<p>I don’t know what it looks like. But to my mind, the world is in chaos. Nothing is the same as when I came here a few days ago. It’s like I’ve walked into another world again. A horrible world of death and fear.</p>
<p>“Miss Feya! Miss Feya!”</p>
<p>Someone’s in front of me. I hear sobbing, and then someone’s in front of me.</p>
<p>“Durene? Oh Durene—help me! My poor boy is down there somewhere!”</p>
<p>“I—I’ll try to find him!”</p>
<p>I hear the sounds of Durene digging with her hands. I reach out, and there’s a woman in front of me. My hand recoils as I touch her frozen skin and find sticky blood.</p>
<p>“Miss…Feya?”</p>
<p>“Who is—oh! You’re…”</p>
<p>“I’m Laken.”</p>
<p>There’s no time for niceties. I guide the trembling woman a bit away from Durene and then get straight to the point.</p>
<p>“Miss Feya, do you know where your husband is? He’s the village head, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>“My husband…?”</p>
<p>She’s in shock too. I want to shake her, but I just wait for her, prodding gently.</p>
<p>“I need to find him. Do you know where he is?”</p>
<p>Even if he can’t transfer ownership of the village to me, he might be able to rally the disorganized villagers. But I can already sense something’s wrong.</p>
<p>“He—he—”</p>
<p>Choked words. I reach out and feel her shaking. Miss Feya sobs and I know what’s happened.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>But there’s no time even for that. I hesitate. Would she be next in charge? I have to try.</p>
<p>“Feya. Miss Feya. I need you to give Riverfarm to me.”</p>
<p>An intake of breath.</p>
<p>“Give? What are you talking about? There’s nothing <em>left!</em>”</p>
<p>“I can’t explain everything, but—I have a Skill. It can help find people, even under the snow, I think. But I need to own this village to use it.”</p>
<p>“A Skill?”</p>
<p>I sound like a complete and absolute loon in my ears. But to Miss Feya, saying that might have been the best thing I could do. She understands Skills, even if she doesn’t know what I’m talking about. But she’s still hesitating, uncertain.</p>
<p>“You need the village?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Can you really save them?”</p>
<p>There’s hope in her voice as well as doubt. But the world’s collapsed around her, and this poor woman is reaching out for any shred of hope. I don’t want to lie to her, so I tell her the truth.</p>
<p>“I can try.”</p>
<p>One second goes by as she thinks. Two. But she has nothing to lose, and everything to gain.</p>
<p>“It’s yours. If you can do something, please, do it!”</p>
<p>I nod and step back from her. I still feel self-conscious, but this time I don’t waver. I raise my head and speak with all the confidence I can muster.</p>
<p>“I claim this village. I claim Riverfarm.”</p>
<p>Nothing. Again. I curse and hear Feya moan. What’s wrong?</p>
<p>Last time—it took a while before I realized that I could sense Durene’s cottage. Maybe there’s a waiting time? If so, I’m screwed. But maybe it didn’t work because Miss Feya isn’t the next village head. She wasn’t elected, and—does the village head have the ability to speak for an entire village anyways?</p>
<p>Damn it, there’s just so much I don’t <em>know!</em> I feel helpless, and angry as well. I have to do something! But nothing I’ve tried has worked and I can hear Durene. She’s&nbsp; barely excavated more than a few feet of snow, and it’s been over ten minutes since we got here. If anyone’s still alive—</p>
<p>No time. No way. The burning helplessness in my chest intensifies. And I hear the same whispering in my heart that I think everyone’s heard before.</p>
<p><em>Just give up. You can’t do anything.</em></p>
<p>It’s the same voice that used to talk to me on the worst nights. It’s the voice that told me a blind kid couldn’t ever do anything. It tries to drag me down.</p>
<p>I am an [Emperor]. But I’m not one, really. I just went through the motions. I’m an actor and I put on a good play, but in the end the genuine article is different from me.</p>
<p>Emperor Norton never questioned himself. Charlemagne, Peter the Great, Leopold—did any of these people ever act like I did? How would I know?</p>
<p><em>What would an [Emperor] do?</em></p>
<p>The little voice in my head mocks me as I listen to people cry out. More than anything, I want to help them. But how? I don’t own this village. There’s a wall in my way, a wall I can’t touch or feel or sense. I can’t break it down. And there’s a wall in the ground, a tomb of snow.</p>
<p>My doubts taunt me. But more than anything I want to act. The Emperor does not wait. He doesn’t hesitate. He does what an Emperor does because he <em>is</em> an Emperor. If Norton ever asked questions, he would never have become an Emperor.</p>
<p>And I—</p>
<p>I can’t let something silly like rules stop me. I don’t own this village? That’s not something a real [Emperor] would accept.</p>
<p>My heart is pounding. I don’t ask questions. I stop hesitating.</p>
<p>People are dying. I want to help them. Have to. Durene is doing her best, but for all her strength, she’s just one person. The villagers are disunited. There’s no one to lead them. No one but me.</p>
<p>So I draw the biting air into my chest and <em>scream.</em></p>
<p>“<em>My name is Laken Godart! I claim this village!</em>”</p>
<p>My voice cuts through the other noises, bringing quietus with it. I can tell everyone’s stopped to stare at me in astonishment. But I don’t falter. I don’t wait, either. I keep shouting, so that everyone can hear me.</p>
<p>“Riverfarm is under my protection! All those who live within it are part of my empire!”</p>
<p>What’s this? No one understands. Who’s this blind young man, shouting nonsense? They’re just words. Anyone can speak nonsense. Anyone can claim anything they want.</p>
<p>But who has the courage to shout it to the world? I do. So I shout and tell everyone that I <em>am</em> an Emperor, because it is true. I will make it true.</p>
<p>“I am Laken, Emperor of the Unseen! If anyone would challenge me, fight my champion, my [Paladin]. Durene!”</p>
<p>For a few seconds I think the villagers are too shocked to even respond. Then I hear a shout.</p>
<p>“Are you insane?”</p>
<p>Prost’s voice is angry. I can hear him moving towards me, but my attention isn’t on that. It’s on the snow under my feet. And the faint sense I have—</p>
<p>Below me is ice. Below that is timber. And then stone. A wall. And pressed up against that wall is a child. He barely moves, but he <em>does</em> move. He’s trapped against the wall and the snow is so constricting that he can only breathe and move a tiny bit. I see his chest rising and falling in my head.</p>
<p>“What nonsense are you shouting!?”</p>
<p>A hand grabs me. I hear an angry voice, and then more voices.</p>
<p>“You claim our village? By what right?”</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“We need help! Stop shouting and—<em>Durene!</em> Come here!”</p>
<p>The villagers have come to me. Of course they would. Here’s this crazy guy shouting at them as they’re in the middle of their grief and desperation. They want to unload their anger onto me. But I’m too busy to care.</p>
<p>“I am an [Emperor].”</p>
<p>They hear me, but who would believe that? They shout at me, and then I hear Durene’s voice.</p>
<p>“Let him go!”</p>
<p>A massive hand moves, and separates Prost from me with ease. He stumbles back, and I hear shouts.</p>
<p>“Durene! Come here!”</p>
<p>“<em>My children are down there! </em>Come with me!”</p>
<p>“You bastard—give me that shovel!”</p>
<p>Screaming. Fighting. Cries for help. I hear it all and see the boy breathing far below. Is this sight? It’s never been so clear to me. I breathe in and out and the world comes into focus.</p>
<p>This is mine. I claim it. It’s not sharp in my head; it’s not my village entirely. But I will have it.</p>
<p>The villagers are fighting. No one will get any work done. I’m angry at them. I know they’re afraid. So am I! But if they can’t work together everyone loses. Durene is shielding me with her body and shouting at them, but she’s no leader. Not yet.</p>
<p>But I am. I am an [Emperor]. I shout.</p>
<p><strong>“Silence!”</strong></p>
<p>And there is. Complete silence. My voice is thunder, and I feel that same sensation in my bones as I did once before, when I shouted at the group of children tormenting Durene, so long ago.</p>
<p>“I am an Emperor.”</p>
<p>My voice is the one sound in the empty world around me. I can feel people staring at me, but they are mute. I keep talking, my voice growing louder.</p>
<p>“Your families, your friends, are all trapped under the snow. I can find them. You will help me. Find something to dig with. We’ll start here. Give Durene her shovel back.”</p>
<p>No one moves. They’re in shock. I don’t have time for it. My hand raises. My voice grows deeper, and it echoes.</p>
<p>“You and you, find something to dig with. You! The shovel! The rest of you, start digging right <em>here.</em> <strong>Move!</strong>”</p>
<p>They move. They can’t help it. But they want to move as well; I’ve given them purpose. I’ve given them hope. I look down with my head and sense the small body beneath me. Growing colder. Growing weaker.</p>
<p>So many. So still. I sense tiny bodies and large ones, motionless beneath the snow. Some still move. Others lie at odd angles, in pieces.</p>
<p>There’s no time to grieve. I point and shout.</p>
<p>“Start digging there! And <em>there!</em>”</p>
<p>It’s like a game. An awful game where each second counts and the prize isn’t measured in points, but real lives. But there are ways to be more efficient.</p>
<p>“There are two shovels here. Dig them up!”</p>
<p>They’re nearest to the surface. If we have those, the villagers won’t have to use the branches and broken bits of wood. Durene is already clearing snow with her spade. I’ll have to stop her from hitting the boy when she gets close.</p>
<p>“Over there! She’s right beneath the snow! Dig with your hands and pull her out!”</p>
<p>I run, and people follow me. I shout, and they listen. There’s no little voice in my head. There’s only a screaming idiot, moving too fast to doubt himself. Every step I take in the snow is sure; my blood is electric. I dash over to the spot and people begin to dig.</p>
<p>“Follow me. Find something to dig with!”</p>
<p>Onwards. I let the villagers dig out their friends and run on.</p>
<p>I’m going to save everyone I can. This—</p>
<p>This is my village now. And I will protect it. I am an [Emperor].</p>
<p>I run and run, and forget that I’m blind. I forget everyone else. I reach down, and pull life out of the ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He only knew it hurt. He had tried screaming, but there was blackness all around him. Cold. It was so cold, and he knew he was buried. His head was full of pain and he knew he was bleeding. It was cold—</p>
<p>But also hot. The air in the small pocket where he was trapped was getting warmer, and every time he took a breath, his head spun.</p>
<p>He was dying.</p>
<p>He wanted to struggle, but he couldn’t even move. He cried and screamed, but no one had heard him. And now he was going to die.</p>
<p>That’s what he knew. He knew it even as he shouted for salvation. And then he heard the scraping.</p>
<p>Someone was digging! Towards him? He shouted desperately, barely daring to hope. But the sounds—they were coming from below him! They were going the wrong way! He screamed again, telling them to come back.</p>
<p>No! Had they missed him? The young man shouted desperately, and then realized the sound was getting louder, not softer! It was coming towards his head!</p>
<p>And then he realized something was off. Snow was breaking around his legs. He could move them! He wriggled with mad desperation, not caring if he hurt himself. He had to get out!</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ve got you.”</p>
<p>A voice pulled him out of the madness. The young man froze, and then realized what was happening.</p>
<p>“You’re upside down. Don’t move and we’ll dig you out.”</p>
<p>The world turned over. Suddenly, the pounding in his head made sense. He waited, unable to bear the waiting but waiting nonetheless, and then felt a warm hand on his leg.</p>
<p>“You’re safe. Hold on just for a second longer.”</p>
<p>He didn’t know the voice. He knew everyone in the village, but he didn’t know the voice. But the hand was warm, and the voice was full of so much confidence—</p>
<p>He cried like a child as the warm hands dug the snow away and then came for him. He was still sobbing as more hands righted him and he was pulled out of the snow and back into the world of color and light.</p>
<p>For a little while he couldn’t see. Tears made his vision blurry and he could only gulp in air, the sweetest, purest thing he’d ever felt in his life. He didn’t want to grow up anymore. He didn’t want to become a famous adventurer or leave this small village. He didn’t want to marry his childhood crush.</p>
<p>He just wanted to be alive. And he was. The young man wept and clutched at the cold ground, and then remembered his name.</p>
<p>Gamel.</p>
<p>When he could finally think again, Gamel looked around and saw what had become of his home. Ice and snow had buried Riverfarm, the only place he had ever known. His house, his father’s home that he had lived in and hated for being so small, was gone.</p>
<p>And so was the rest of the world. Gamel looked, but he couldn’t see anything familiar. Where was the forest? Where was the river? Where were the road and the other houses?</p>
<p>He saw nothing familiar, save for a few rooftops and broken wood. But then he saw the people.</p>
<p>The villagers of Riverfarm numbered little over a hundred. He knew all of them by name, if not as friends. He recognized over thirty of them now, digging up the snow in teams. But one person stood out among the frantic workers, one person Gamel didn’t recognize.</p>
<p>It was another young man, like Gamel. He had to be the blind man, the one who was staying at Durene’s cottage. The one who liked the half-Troll.</p>
<p>But then the blind man turned and pointed. His eyes were closed, but he seemed to know where things were. He shouted, and Gamel realized that he was the owner of the voice and the warm hands.</p>
<p>And when he heard the voice, Gamel stood up. He ran over to help, even before he quite knew what he was doing. And when he did know, he only ran faster. His friends were buried. His family! His love.</p>
<p>The blind young man had found a woman trying to excavate her house. Her hands were raw and bleeding from digging. But she still turned the snow crimson as she searched for any clue, any hint of her child.</p>
<p>“Miss.”</p>
<p>The young man pulled her away. She resisted, but two other villagers pulled her back. She was sobbing, crying out for her missing child. Gamel looked at the ground, but he could see nothing but packed snow. Where would you even begin searching for a missing kid? He could have been swept away, or buried in a pocket. You could dig for hours and not find him.</p>
<p>But the blind man only hesitated for one second. He seemed to search the ground and then pointed.</p>
<p>“There.”</p>
<p>Gamel stared. But men and women rushed forwards with hoes, shovels, even a board of wood, anything they could dig with. They began to send up flurries of snow where the blind man had pointed, digging with all their strength, totally confident in his prediction.</p>
<p>“Fifteen feet down. He isn’t moving.”</p>
<p>The blind man was supervising the work. He was also speaking to the mother. Gamel stared, and then saw two closed eyelids swing towards him. The not-gaze made him freeze. He couldn’t see him. But—</p>
<p>“You! Find something to dig with! Hurry!”</p>
<p>Gamel was running before he knew what had been said. He came back with a pitchfork someone had found. The tines could lift chunks of ice out. He began digging with the others, widening the hole.</p>
<p>“<em>Stop!</em>”</p>
<p>The voice halted them and everyone froze as one. The young man leapt into the hole. Without looking he seized a spade.</p>
<p>“He’s a foot down. Give me some room!”</p>
<p>Gamel stood back and watched. Carefully, quickly, the young man dug. He paused, and then shoved away more snow. Then he lifted something out of the ground.</p>
<p>“<em>Siccy!</em>”</p>
<p>Gamel recognized Sic, one of the boys who belonged to the mother. She rushed forwards, and then screamed again.</p>
<p>“He’s not breathing.”</p>
<p>The young man—Laken, that was his name—was calm. Or rather, he wasn’t panicking. He shouted at the woman.</p>
<p>“Move back! Get me a clear space above!”</p>
<p>Hands pulled him and the still boy out of the hole. Gamel watched, numb horror in his chest. The boy was dead. But Laken wasn’t done yet.</p>
<p>“Breathe into his mouth. Like this. Steady breaths.”</p>
<p>He was doing something, showing the woman something. Then he put his hands on the boy’s chest and began to pump, as if he was trying to push something back into the child.</p>
<p>“Compressions. Place your hand on his chest like this. Now—”</p>
<p>The woman breathed and Laken pressed on his chest. Gamel watched without hope. Nothing was going to happen. This was no spell or [Healer]’s Skill. It was just air and some weird motion. It couldn’t—</p>
<p>The boy <em>gasped</em>. He choked and his eyes flew open. The mother fell backwards, but then she <em>shrieked</em> and threw herself at her son. Gamel stared. His eyes stung as the boy breathed again.</p>
<p>“Give him air!”</p>
<p>Laken forced the mother back a bit. Then he stood up and ran to another body being pulled out of the snow. Gamel followed. Laken showed the rescuers what to do.</p>
<p>“Five minutes. If they don’t wake up by then—”</p>
<p>It didn’t work. Gamel stared at the cold body of the girl he’d always thought was too ugly to dance with and felt a hole open up in his chest. Laken moved on. The next body they brought up was cold as well, and Laken didn’t even bother with it. The next was also dead. The next was alive and the woman clung to Laken even as he shouted.</p>
<p>The dead couldn’t be brought back so easily. But the breathing and compressions—helped. It gave people hope and they tried it until Laken told them it was too late. It was a last-ditch effort he said; they were already dead. It was too late.</p>
<p>But it worked. Once, twice. Out of the many casualties, Gamel saw two cough up ice and snow and breathe again. A child, practically blue and still bleeding, opened her mouth and wailed after her breath had stopped. A young man inhaled, and nearly choked again as his family threw their arms around him.</p>
<p>And many who came out of the ground were still alive. They had clung to life, trapped in tiny places, hoping, begging silently for rescue. And it came, with precise accuracy and no shortage of willing hands. Gamel dug to save people trapped like him. He threw away the pitchfork and grabbed a proper shovel when one was found. He dug and pulled out his best friend, the [Blacksmith].</p>
<p>His father.</p>
<p>Gamel stared down at the empty gaze and snow-covered beard. Snow hadn’t filled his lungs like the others. But his neck had snapped as he had tumbled. It was twisted the wrong way.</p>
<p>The young man reached down with trembling hands. He had to fix it. He tried to turn his father’s head back the right way. Gently at first, and then with more strength. It was no good. He felt something <em>shifting</em> beneath his hands and stumbled away to vomit.</p>
<p>When he was choking and wiping at his mouth, someone touched his shoulder. Gamel spun, and looked into closed eyelids.</p>
<p>Laken only held his shoulder. He had never met Gamel’s father. He didn’t know the man. But he looked in Gamel’s eyes with his sightless ones and said only one thing:</p>
<p>“There are more people to save.”</p>
<p>So Gamel left his father on the ground. He dug and dug until his hands blistered and bled and pulled up more bodies. A little girl who’d always gotten on his nerves. Dead. A husband who everyone knew beat his wife. Alive. He was sobbing like Gamel had been and he dug with his bare hands to pull his living spouse out of the ground with their dead baby in her hands.</p>
<p>There was no sense to it. No justice. There were only places where the cold hand of fate had taken lives, and miracles where that boundary had not been crossed.</p>
<p>Yet with every second they spent under the snow, the villagers would have died. And there were so many. If the others had been digging with no idea where they were, how many would have died?</p>
<p>But Laken pointed and the villagers were found. Within the hour, everyone had been found, and for a miracle, the living outnumbered the dead. Those who were alive were injured yes, some badly. They were all close to or frostbitten in places, and many were exhausted from digging. They were homeless. Hungry.</p>
<p>But they were alive. And though Gamel’s hands bled, he held the girl who he’d dreamed of marrying as she cried and the [Midwife] bandaged her bleeding leg.</p>
<p>They were alive. Gamel had to keep wiping away tears, and his nose was stuffed. He didn’t care.</p>
<p>They were <em>alive. </em>After the last body had come up, the villagers just sat on the snow, crying, tending to injuries, hugging each other. Being alive.</p>
<p>Somehow, there was even food. The half-Tr—Durene had brought food with her at the blind man’s orders. And there was cloth to bandage wounds, even! As more and more hands were free, Laken directed them to dig up stores of food, buried in store rooms and cellars.</p>
<p>Gamel hadn’t seen Durene before now. He’d been too busy digging. But he saw her tossing a massive amount of snow as she continued to dig, tirelessly.</p>
<p>Part of him was afraid of her. Part of him could still remember the Troll and the way the adults had been so frightened of her. Part of him remembered throwing things at the Troll-girl when he saw her. He saw her dig up food to hand around and the countless people she had saved by herself, and part of him felt ashamed.</p>
<p>Laken didn’t just know where the bodies were. He found root cellars, and knew which ones were the most well-stocked. He had them dug up, and immediately had the food passed around to the starving people.</p>
<p>The food was meant to last a family the entire winter, but no one said a word, even if it was their stocks being opened and shared. Or rather, who would even think about something like that right now?</p>
<p>They were alive. That was all that mattered.</p>
<p>Gamel tore at some frozen bread someone had warmed up and saw there was a fire going. Someone was making a soup out of vegetables, but Gamel could have eaten the loaf with only snow and dirt as seasoning. He shared the frozen piece with the girl sitting next to him and stood up.</p>
<p>Laken was standing in the center of the village, still ordering people about. He wasn’t shouting—his voice was hoarse and raw and the—Durene was standing next to him anxiously. Gamel hesitated, and then brought Laken a bowl of soup when it was done.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>The blind man took the bowl and thanked Gamel. But that was all wrong. Gamel’s throat closed up. He had to say it.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>That was all he could say. What he had to say. Other villagers heard Gamel and came over. They said different things, used different words. Some hugged Laken. Other found more food, kissed him, just cried. They all meant the same thing.</p>
<p><em>Thank you.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I pulled up dead people. I pulled up living people. Now, I can barely move my arms to lift the spoon. But I eat because I have to. I have to keep going. There’s tragedy around me, but if I stop to stare at it I’ve made a mistake. My heart’s too busy beating to stop and weep. That’s how it should be.</p>
<p>“Anyone who can—we need houses.”</p>
<p>The snow is so <em>deep</em>. But I’m already thinking about tonight. The villagers—they’re all out, living and dead. And while the dead will keep for a while, the living are freezing. And it’s going to be dark and cold tonight. It’s barely mid morning despite the herculean efforts of the day, but we need to get as many houses out as possible.</p>
<p>“Durene, can you start clearing snow out over here? There’s a barn—if we empty it, we could have a place for everyone to sleep at least.”</p>
<p>I look at Durene, although I can’t see her. But I can sense her, and touch her, and feel her beside me. That’s more than enough. I know she has to be tired, but she doesn’t show any of her exhaustion.</p>
<p>“I can do that. If someone helps get rid of the snow…”</p>
<p>“Is there anything better than a shovel? Pickaxes, maybe?”</p>
<p>Do they even have those? A young man hovering by me—the one who gave me the bowl of soup—offers a suggestion.</p>
<p>“What about magic?”</p>
<p>“Magic?”</p>
<p>I’m caught totally off-guard. But as it turns out, the young man knows a very weak flame spell. And so do other people in the village! It’s a bit better than digging, but not by much.</p>
<p>“Hold off on it. Wait until we dig out a building and then you’ll defrost it.”</p>
<p>I keep ordering people about. They obey as if it’s natural and I don’t question it. They need a leader. And I’m the best choice.</p>
<p>Only I can sense the entire village. It’s almost all under the snow, but I can sense which houses are intact, which ones have valuable items, and most importantly, which are closest to the surface. It is like a game, and I organize people as best I can.</p>
<p>What’s the first and most important thing? The elements. There’s already a small fire going.</p>
<p>“Get someone with wood chopping skills and find some trees! I want two—no, four big fires going!”</p>
<p>Those with fire magic can light what wood we have. That’s not enough of course. I ask around and find who might have the most clothes. We get that excavated and blankets, clothing—all go to children and those with injuries first. Bandages come from recycled cloth first boiled and dried by a fire.</p>
<p>What else? While I’m doing that I wonder about animals. I look—but they’re all dead. We dug up the people first. Still, I know where they are. All of that is frozen food that can be retrieved later.</p>
<p>“Mister Laken? Emperor Laken?”</p>
<p>A voice. I turn. Prost is standing before me, humble.</p>
<p>“Emperor?”</p>
<p>I sense him bowing his head.</p>
<p>“Yes sir. Durene’s dug up a good part of the barn, but she says it’s not stable.”</p>
<p>“Damn.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell when it’s all buried.</p>
<p>“Can it be fixed? Who has skills in…carpentry?”</p>
<p>People around me provide answers. I choose three of the best builders to take a look at the building. Someone calls out to me. One of her sons—a teenager—was injured badly. His foot was broken. It needs to be set, but the [Midwife] has no potions.</p>
<p>I find some. By that point several people are telling me they need weapons. For Durene?</p>
<p>No. For wolves and monsters that might attack the injured. I find a sword buried deep and cast about. Broken bows…I find a few locations and have people start digging.</p>
<p>People ask me whether they should cook more soup. I ask and find out what the best recipes are. I direct them to a dead cow.</p>
<p>More work. It’s getting dark apparently—I can feel the chill on my skin and the feeling of sunlight is gone. People need light, but torches are in short supply. And the team working on the barn and other buildings don’t want the badly-directed torchlight to mess with their work.</p>
<p>I have an idea.</p>
<p>“Wait a second.”</p>
<p>I pull out a rectangle of metal. It’s always in my pocket although I haven’t turned it on until now. I push the power button.</p>
<p>“Siri? Turn on flashlight.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, but I’m not able to do that.”</p>
<p>People around me exclaim in awe, but I just scowl. I have to find the flashlight app buried among the various ones I’ve downloaded and press it manually. I <em>hate </em>doing that.</p>
<p>Then again, I don’t exactly need a flashlight app, do I? It was put on my iPhone as a joke by my best friend. After Zoe installed it on my iPhone she told me it would help other people if they got lost, since I can find my way around in the dark just like the light. It would make them feel better, she told me.</p>
<p>And now? My iPhone glows with light. I can’t tell, but people around me are shouting ‘magic’. I give it to Prost and show him how to use it.</p>
<p>“Can I really use an artifact like this?”</p>
<p>“Just don’t drop it.”</p>
<p>I smile and turn away. The iPhone’s batteries probably don’t have that much juice in them in this cold, but the light helps. Prost and the others find the fault they’re looking for and fix it.</p>
<p>“Laken.”</p>
<p>Durene has the iPhone in her hands. I turn from having more blankets dug up and take it back from her.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Durene.”</p>
<p>“Is that the ‘phone’ you were talking about?”</p>
<p>“It is. Does it look interesting to you?”</p>
<p>I can’t imagine how the screen and the display looks to someone who’s never seen a light bulb. There’s awe in Durene’s voice.</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s like a star is in your hands.”</p>
<p>A star? I smile.</p>
<p>“Would you like to use it?”</p>
<p>“Me? No! I would never dare. What if I broke it? I’ve never seen magic like that before.”</p>
<p>“This is no magic. Anyone can use it. Here.”</p>
<p>In the lull of the night as the immediate worries of the villagers are temporarily alleviated, I show Durene how to work the controls.</p>
<p>“You see that little triangle at the bottom? Press it. Now—”</p>
<p>Durene jumps as music begins to play from the iPhone. I take it from her and turn up the volume. Heads turn. I walk towards the villagers, holding a glowing star in my hands that sings with a woman’s voice. I walk among them, reassuring, checking on the wounded, finding things for those with energy to do. They’re warm, fed, alive. For some reason they still keep thanking me.</p>
<p>I keep walking, and a woman sings about love in French, a language none of the villagers know. But her haunting voice brings life to a frozen world. So the villagers listen to <em>L’hymne à l’amour </em>as their loved ones lie in the falling snow. And they cry although they don’t know what the song is about.</p>
<p>And at the same time, they know what the song is. The singer conveys all they need to know. When the song ends I check the battery. Durene sees a single digit and a red sliver of a bar. So I play one last song.</p>
<p>It’s not a song about love. It’s not even in French. It’s a song about family and home and regret. A man called Reinhard Mey sings in German, <em> Viertel vor Sieben, </em>a song never heard before in this world. And that too speaks to the villagers.</p>
<p>The last echoes of the song die out. I turn off the iPhone and find a place to sleep. There’s already a space cleared for me, and Durene as well to my surprise. We could have gone back to the cottage—we will, if only to pick up Frostwing. But for now I sit, and find once I’m sitting that I’m out of energy.</p>
<p>I put my head down and I’m out like a light in moments. I rest and the villagers around me live another night, crying themselves to sleep. And I am still an [Emperor] when I wake up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Emperor Level 9!]</p>
<p>[Skill – Empire: Blessing of the Hearth Obtained!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 42</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I woke up, I felt rested. Which is odd considering that I woke up just after six in the morning. I know I got substantially less than six hours of sleep considering how late I worked. But that was probably due to the Skill I received.</p>
<p>A skill for an empire. That’s the only way I can look at it. And the blessing—it’s powerful, I know that.</p>
<p>Most of the villagers did indeed sleep in the barn Durene helped dig up with the rest of the villagers. It was the best choice. And though my beautiful and courageous friend kept working after that, even Durene has her limits. A few more houses were uncovered and more bodies fit in there, but most slept in cramped conditions in a patched-up building surrounded by snow.</p>
<p>Under such conditions, where no fire could be lit and most of the heat came from blankets and body heat, you could normally expect a lot of discomfort. But that night the grieving slept like logs and woke up just as refreshed as me. And better—they were healed by their rest!</p>
<p>Somehow, minor cuts had scabbed over and healed almost overnight. The larger injuries weren’t gone—but neither were they as bad as yesterday.</p>
<p>“It’s totally overpowered.”</p>
<p>That was my only comment when Durene told me about the healed people. It must be that I can only have one blessing, or that only one empire skill will work at the same time. Or…maybe [Emperors] are just that powerful.</p>
<p>Regardless, everyone knows it was due to me. The villagers woke up and made breakfast—helped change bandages—they’re self-sufficient and intelligent. But they all look to me as I sit with Durene, eating some soup greasy with fat and chunks of meat.</p>
<p>Here’s an irony: because all the animals were killed in the avalanche, the villagers are now eating a meaty broth, a rare treat for them in the winter or any other time, really. The warm, rich food warms my chest.</p>
<p>I look around and find that eyes are on me. I can feel them, even if I can’t see them. Plus, Durene lets me know.</p>
<p>For once, the gazes aren’t filled with petty concerns about Durene. I haven’t heard a bad word for her since I took charge, and indeed, no one’s busy enough to get into quarrels over anything except how to do things more efficiently.</p>
<p>After some thought, I stand up. I don’t make a speech. I don’t talk about yesterday, or my class. People have heard what I said; word gets around even in a disaster situation. But I still don’t mention it.</p>
<p>I turn towards the doors. I know the bodies are still out there. And the houses are still buried in the snow. Scavengers are going to come soon, if they haven’t already. The dead need to be buried with respect, and I’m still worried about monster attacks.</p>
<p>“Let’s get to work.”</p>
<p>So saying, I walk towards the doors. And the villagers follow me without question. Durene’s walking by my side, and I’m comforted by her. She whispers to me.</p>
<p>“I leveled up. Five times!”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“And I got two Skills! <em>Two!</em>”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>I don’t smile. There’s still so much to do, and there’s been too much loss for that. But I keep walking forwards. Riverfarm needs all the help it can get. And it is mine now. My responsibility.</p>
<p>I feel sunlight on my skin. I look up, and know every inch and crevice of the village. I walk forwards, ignoring hands reached out to help me along. In this place I am even more sure-footed than people with sight. And it occurs to me, that despite all the things I’ve been through, I have been so lucky since I came to this world.</p>
<p>In little over a month I found someone to love. I found a way to see without seeing, I obtained a noisy pet, and I was in the right place to help save lives. I might have even changed a few minds about judging the girl who walks beside me.</p>
<p>Back home I was happy in my own way. But here I can see. Here I have a purpose. So as I walk and begin ordering people about, I wonder. Is this world meant for me? Is this destiny or chance? And is there any way I could possibly one day call this place…?</p>
<p>Home?</p>
<p>I don’t know. But I’ll take it all one day at a time. As I am. Not Laken, but Laken Godart, Emperor of the Unseen. Protector of Durene’s Cottage. Ruler of Riverfarm Village.</p>
<p>[Emperor].</p>

		<p>Maybe it’s the wine talking, but I don’t think Reynold the [Butler]’s such a bad guy. I mean, sure, he’s a bit uptight and he’s in the employ of a woman who might soon kill or torture me, but Reynold? He’s got class.</p>
<p>It’s probably the alcohol. But in my defense, I’ve downed over half a bottle by myself. Not much of a defense I’ll grant you, but my nerves are still shaking.</p>
<p>Almost literally. I sit at the head of Magnolia’s magical carriage, staring at the sleet and snow blasting around us and shudder again.</p>
<p>Goblins.</p>
<p>It feels like just a moment ago they were about to dice us up. In truth, it’s been more like twenty minutes. And I’m still not over it.</p>
<p>Neither is Reynold. The poor carriage driver sits hunched in his seat. The wine – courtesy of the empty bottle I tossed a while back – fortified us both. But neither of us are exactly happy.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why we chat a bit as we keep going towards Invrisil, and Magnolia Reinhart’s mansion. Not about anything in particular; we talk just to keep ourselves from thinking. But I do learn something really interesting, and so does he.</p>
<p>“You met Erin?”</p>
<p>“You know Miss Solstice, Miss Griffin?”</p>
<p>We stare at each other. I had no idea. I mean, I know Erin mentioned meeting Lady Magnolia. She told me a lot about her encounter and of course I grilled her on the details, but did she mention a [Butler]?</p>
<p>…Crap. I think she might have. But of course I wouldn’t have paid attention to that. And did she mention his name? Was it Reynold?</p>
<p>I have a bad feeling this might have been one of the things I ignored about her story. Idiot! But Reynold seems just as impressed in his way that I know Erin.</p>
<p>“She did mention you, Miss. I gather she was worried about your safety, but I hardly realized you two were on such good terms.”</p>
<p>“It’s odd, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>I sigh as I stare across the frozen landscape. God. I wish she was here. She met Magnolia Reinhart and came away without a scratch somehow. Erin might be annoying at times, thoughtless, but I’d rather have her as I’m about to enter the lair of the beast than not.</p>
<p>And when she told me all she’d been through—I clench my hand as I remember. She told me about Magnolia, and I flipped out at her. I got into a fight with her! True, I’d just lost some fingers, but I should have been more understanding.</p>
<p>Regrets. I ride on with Reynold and try to answer his questions as I think about what’s going to happen next. Will I die? Or will I get a chance to convince Lady Magnolia that—what? I’m on the same side as she is?</p>
<p>That’s what she told Erin. But I don’t know if I can believe that. I’m damn sure that I can’t trust her or anyone with the knowledge of how to make guns. But how do I get out of this with my skin intact?</p>
<p>I have a few ideas. The first of which is drinking from the second wine bottle I got Ressa to pass up to us. Ivolethe greedily slurps down the rich wine as she sits next to me. It’s actually sort of disgusting the more I look at her, but it’s one of those things I can’t take my eyes off of. She’s drunk at least three times her body weight already, I swear, but she doesn’t even seem daunted by the sheer physical impossibility of it. She just keeps drinking happily, and singing some song that might be in Celtic.</p>
<p>“Miss, I wonder if I could have a word?”</p>
<p>Reynold’s voice breaks me out of my thoughts. I look over to him.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>He hesitates, and casts a look back towards the carriage behind him. I look too—Ressa’s closed the hatch separating us. Reassured, Reynold speaks to me, but quietly, and I scoot over to listen.</p>
<p>“I know Lady Reinhart has requested your presence, just as she has the other…people from your world.”</p>
<p>Gods. He knows. But Reynold doesn’t seem bothered by that. He’s frowning, and I can tell he’s thinking something over. Anything to help me out. I listen as he comes to a decision.</p>
<p>“It’s true her methods may seem sudden to people who do not know her—”</p>
<p>I snort.</p>
<p>“That’s an understatement. Kidnapping me out of a city is normal, is it?”</p>
<p>To my surprise Reynold’s lips twitch.</p>
<p>“More than you might think. No one gainsays a member of the Five Families, least of all Magnolia Reinhart. And it’s true that Lady Reinhart demands much. I know you have your issues with her. But…”</p>
<p>“But?”</p>
<p>Reynold hesitates. He looks again back towards the carriage. Ressa hasn’t said anything since the Goblins. Reassured, he continues talking. Even so, he lowers his voice to a whisper. I practically have to put my ear to his lips to hear him over the rushing wind.</p>
<p>“She is not a bad woman, Miss Ryoka. Driven, yes, but she cares deeply for the fate of her servants and all those living on this continent. If you can create even one of the wonders the others from your world claim—”</p>
<p>“Reynold. Stop talking.”</p>
<p>Both Reynold and I jump in our seats. He twists in his seat, face pale. But the window into the carriage is still closed. I stare at the closed door in amazement. We’re still going at top speed, and the wind is blasting around us. It’s hard just to hear Reynold’s voice, but Ressa was <em>inside</em> the coach.</p>
<p>She heard that? Is it another [Ninja] skill? Or [Assassin]?</p>
<p>What is she?</p>
<p>I have no idea. But her words are enough to scare Reynold witless. He grips the reins of the carriage in a death grip and refuses to talk, no matter what I try. So the rest of the ride passes in silence. But the entire while I’m thinking.</p>
<p>Magnolia. What does she want? She claims not to want to use technology from my world. But I don’t believe her. So what should I do? Help her? Do I have a choice?</p>
<p>How do I get myself out of this one? I’ve got…one option? Two. Mm…maybe three. Three ways to get out of this mess.</p>
<p>Fighting isn’t one of those options. Aside from the fact that I’m pretty sure Ressa is a better fighter than I am, I know how influential Magnolia Reinhart is. Even if by some miracle I ran away, she could have every adventurer, city guardsman and assassin on the continent after me in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>No, I’ve got to talk my way out of this. I just wish I was confident in my ability to do so. So I sit in the cold, apprehensive, trying to bring out all the intelligence, all the wit I have.</p>
<p>But I am afraid. If I were the me of a month ago, I might be so cocksure and brave to think I can get out of this no matter what happens. But now—</p>
<p>The carriage slows. I sit up instantly and see something appear out of the white background. A mansion, guarded by high walls and a single gate.</p>
<p>“The manor of Magnolia Reinhart.”</p>
<p>That’s all Reynold says as he drives us through the gates. They swing open instantly as we approach, but I see no gatekeeper. Automatic magical gates?</p>
<p>Yeah. Why not? But then my cynicism is lost as I stare at the mansion.</p>
<p>“Oh wow.”</p>
<p>Erin told me a bit about Magnolia’s mansion, but I was mainly focusing on what Magnolia wanted of her and me. She told me about the magic—</p>
<p>But this is something else.</p>
<p>A whale swims across the front of the house, gliding across the stone as if it were a sea. A line of metal giants, suits of armor with empty visors, stand at attention, flanking the entrance. And a cloud floats through the suddenly clear skies overhead. Even the air is warmer, and as I step outside the coach, I suddenly feel warm in my clothes.</p>
<p>It’s suddenly spring again. A cool breeze blows, and I look around and find a group of men and women attired in servant’s clothing are standing with the Golems. I hop off the front of the carriage and feel my cramped legs protesting. I stare awkwardly at the servants. Well, what do I do? Reynold’s sitting in the front seat, quiet. But what about these other servants?</p>
<p>Are they a welcoming committee? For me? Is Magnolia Reinhart really—</p>
<p>“Welcome back, Miss Ressa.”</p>
<p><em>Fuck.</em> They scared the ever living <em>crap</em> out of me. All of the servants speak at once as they bow towards the carriage. I look back and see Ressa stepping down from the side of the carriage as Reynold holds the door open.</p>
<p>Now here’s a contrast. She’s dressed like a maid, but she descends and walks past me like a queen. Of course, I was taught proper posture and etiquette when I was young, but I didn’t take much to it.</p>
<p>But Ressa? Ressa could fill in for the Queen of England any time she wanted. I feel like an idiot as I watch her walk ahead of me. Ressa takes a look at the gathered household staff and begins giving orders like a general.</p>
<p>“Teresa, Bener, tell the others to prepare more refreshments for our guests. Ryoka Griffin will be meeting with Lady Magnolia at once. Eve, a pot of tea. Reynold—”</p>
<p>She turns to the [Butler] and I see him bowing his head.</p>
<p>“—Have the carriage inspected for damage. Then I want you to test the spell lattice. If the wards are damaged, schedule an appointment to have them recast. The [Invisibility Field] should not have cut out from a mere unenchanted bolt.”</p>
<p>“At once, Miss Ressa.”</p>
<p>Reynold hurries back to the coach as I stare. Wait, so that was an accident back there? I thought Rags just hit us to make us appear again, but something malfunctioned?</p>
<p>Ressa isn’t even slowing down. She keeps giving orders as people scurry away from us. I eye the imposing Golems. What are they for? To welcome her back? Or to restrain me?</p>
<p>It doesn’t look like I’m getting the red carpet welcome. I look at Ivolethe—she’s too busy flying into the suits of armor and laughing at them from the inside to pay attention.</p>
<p>“Pst. Ivolethe.”</p>
<p>The tiny faerie hears me. She flies back, opening her mouth to comment, but I shake my head at her warningly.</p>
<p>“Don’t speak. And don’t follow me into the manor. Just stay outside, okay? If you can, find out where I am. But don’t go inside. It’s dangerous—”</p>
<p>I break off and Ivolethe flies away from me as Ressa turns her head to stare at me. She doesn’t beckon, but I can tell she wants me to come over to her.</p>
<p>I fold my arms and wait. Like hell I’m taking orders from her. Ressa frowns slightly; then she looks up and sighs.</p>
<p>I look up too. I see only darkness overhead, and then a drop of water hits me right in the eye. As I curse I realize the cloud Erin told me about—the one normally circling Magnolia’s garden—is right overhead. And even as I think that, I feel the cloud open up overhead.</p>
<p>Rain begins pouring down on my head, instantly drenching me. And only me. The cloud seems determined to shower me, and I sprint towards the mansion, swearing a blue streak as I reach shelter.</p>
<p>Instantly, the rain stops. I stand, dripping, in the lush interior of a mansion that would put Versailles to shame, and see a gaggle of [Maids], [Manservants], [Butlers], and other staff staring wide-eyed at me.</p>
<p>I hear footsteps, and turn to see Ressa walk in behind me. There’s not a drop of water on her clothing. She looks down her nose at me as I drip onto the marble flagstones. As if it’s my fault I just got <em>rained on</em> in the <em>winter.</em></p>
<p>“Your damn Mistress did that, didn’t she?”</p>
<p>Ressa makes no response. But her lips do twitch as if she’s suppressing a smirk.</p>
<p>“A towel will be provided for you shortly. Lady Magnolia will see you personally. If you will follow me?”</p>
<p>Without another word she begins striding off down the corridor. I stare at her back, but I’ve got no choice. Either I follow her, or I bet something else happens. One of the Golems will start beating me to death, maybe.</p>
<p>I follow her, walking fast to keep up. A [Maid] appears by my side and offers me a towel. I snatch it, dry myself, and hurl it into the face of a passing [Butler]. He drops whatever he was holding and I storm on. If they’re not going to play nice, neither am I.</p>
<p>Okay, that last bit from me was an overreaction. That man didn’t deserve that, and the look I get from Ressa isn’t pleasant to say the least. But I’m only now realizing that this is happening.</p>
<p>I’m going to meet Lady Magnolia. Not a minute after I got out of the carriage. She’s not going to give me any time to collect myself or prepare. And she’s going to surprise me and try to catch me off guard any way she can to get the upper hand.</p>
<p>Like that just now. Seriously? Making a cloud rain on me? That’s juvenile. But as a way to keep me off balance, it definitely worked.</p>
<p>Ressa pauses and turns left down a large corridor. She stops before a set of double doors and looks at me reprovingly.</p>
<p>“Lady Magnolia awaits you, Ryoka Griffin.”</p>
<p>Just that? No warnings? No hints about what’s going to happen? I take a deep breath.</p>
<p>Crap. This isn’t good. I can tell my nerves are still rattled. And an internal check tells me I’m not only a bit drunk, but I could really use a catnap.</p>
<p>But there’s no helping it. I’m in the lion’s den. Or is it Dragon’s den? Bah. I’d rather go up against Teriarch in another riddle game than Magnolia.</p>
<p>And then Ressa pulls open the doors. She steps inside, and I follow her. I stare around an inordinately pink room, looking out over the main area of the manor. We’re on the second floor? When did we get up here?</p>
<p>It’s decorated sparsely for such a lavish room. Aside from the huge windows looking out, there are only two couches and a tea table in the center. I’m sure other furniture used to be here, but now the room is empty save for that. It makes everything feel larger, and somehow more oppressive at the same time.</p>
<p>My eyes find a small pot of steaming tea on the table. I see the empty couch, and then my eyes travel to look at the other occupant of the room, the woman whom Ressa now stands behind.</p>
<p>And then—there she is. Sitting on a plush couch in the center of the room. Poised, elegant, calm and collected. Holding a tea cup in one hand and staring directly at me.</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia.</p>
<p>My breath catches in my chest for a second. This is too sudden. I haven’t prepared, haven’t steeled myself—</p>
<p>But here she is. And it’s too late to slow down, because Magnolia comes out guns blazing.</p>
<p>“Ryoka! So good to see you again!”</p>
<p>Her bright, cheerful voice nearly gives me a heart attack. I’d almost forgotten—but now I remember. Lady Magnolia. For all you might hear of her wealth, power, and influence, in person she’s quite energetic.</p>
<p>Disarmingly so. Magnolia beckons me to the couch. I hesitate, but then walk over and take a seat. Across from me, the noblewoman beams, the very picture of delight. I keep my eyes on her face.</p>
<p>Remember, she’s not nearly as naïve and innocent as she seems. She acts like Erin, but she’s not. Be on your guard—</p>
<p>“Can I offer you anything? Tea? Biscuits? A knife to the throat? How would you feel most comfortable?”</p>
<p>What? I freeze in my seat. Magnolia laughs lightly as she studies my face. Her eyes are sharp; she watches me like a cat studying a mouse.</p>
<p>“Please, Miss Ryoka. You practically <em>ooze</em> wariness. Even if I did not have my [Sense Intentions] Skill—which I do and am quite adept at using—I would be able to tell how tense you are. Relax, my dear. You are not in danger. Yet.”</p>
<p>Mind games. Right off the bat. She’s not even pretending—not that I’d believe her—damn. I blink, try to catch my balance. What’s my response here?</p>
<p>“I’m not thirsty.”</p>
<p>Brilliant, Ryoka. You’re really showing off your debating skills right now. Dad would be so proud. I grit my teeth and stare at the tea pot. Magnolia raises her eyebrows. She glances up at Ressa, and shrugs.</p>
<p>“At least you weren’t foolish enough to ask if the tea is poisoned. Honestly, why would anyone waste good tea like that?”</p>
<p>“I can think of a few reasons.”</p>
<p>“Really? It must be terrible, being so paranoid so young. Don’t you think, Ressa?”</p>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>
<p>Behind Lady Magnolia, the maid nods briefly. I stare at her.</p>
<p>“Thanks for sending your maid to personally escort me. I was touched.”</p>
<p>“Think nothing of it, please. It would have been so inconvenient if you’d fled, and Ressa did manage to protect you from those Goblins, after all.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia chuckles about that, as if Goblin armies are a regular occurrence. Which…is actually not that far from the truth. I stare at her.</p>
<p>“And the rain cloud? Your handiwork as well?”</p>
<p>“A greeting. I know it was a naughty prank; I couldn’t resist. Do forgive me.”</p>
<p>And there’s no way to turn it on her. I could…what? Get angry? Pursue the issue? We haven’t even gotten down to the brass tacks yet. I move on.</p>
<p>“And you made time to see me right away. I must be <em>so </em>important.”</p>
<p>Across from me, Lady Magnolia sips from her tea and smiles.</p>
<p>“Well, some might think so. Myself, I was just bored of meeting stuffy dignitaries. I needed some entertainment, so I cancelled my discussion with one of my visitors to see you.”</p>
<p>“How…kind.”</p>
<p>She twinkles at me, all flowers and blades hidden in the petals.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it? I did consider letting you wait for a few hours while I attended to other business, but I feared you might run off again if I did.”</p>
<p>“No fear. I’m not stupid enough to run.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>And there it is again! The woman wears the most bland expression possible as she delivers a damn good retort. I just stare at her for a second. The Magnolia I’m used to dealing with did <em>not</em> act like this. Why is she taking the gloves off so early?</p>
<p>Regain the flow of the conversation. I glance at the tea pot. There’s an empty cup and saucer. I reach for it and pour myself a cup. Ressa and Magnolia watch me, one disapprovingly, the other amused.</p>
<p>“Thirsty? My dear, let Ressa do that for you. She <em>is</em> a [Maid].”</p>
<p>“And a [Ninja].”</p>
<p>I mutter as I fill my teacup. Magnolia laughs again.</p>
<p>“A [Ninja]? You think Ressa has a <em>[Ninja] </em>class?”</p>
<p>She sounds delighted. I stare at her as she turns and laughs in Ressa’s face.</p>
<p>“Ressa, did you hear that?”</p>
<p>“I did, milady.”</p>
<p>“A [Ninja]! Wouldn’t that be quite amazing to see? If I bought you some dark clothing, would you hang from the ceiling and jump out of the shadows to fill my cup?”</p>
<p>The Lady Reinhart practically chokes on her drink as she giggles. I just stare at her, and then realize Ressa’s giving me a death glare. Um. Looks like I was mistaken.</p>
<p>“So she’s <em>not</em> a ninja.”</p>
<p>“Oh please. Does Ressa look like an islander to you? [Assassins] are the class of choice here; a [Ninja] would be a completely different culture!”</p>
<p>Magnolia snorts as she takes a deep drink of tea. I cautiously do likewise. I’m pretty sure the cup isn’t poisoned—why bother if I’m here and she can just do whatever she wants by force? But—</p>
<p>The instant my tongue touches the tea, it practically goes numb. Poison? I nearly spit out the liquid before I realize what I’m tasting.</p>
<p>Sugar. It’s practically liquid <em>sugar</em>! I don’t know how many sugar cubes died to make the tea this sweet—all I know is that I’ve tasted sodas that weren’t nearly this bad for your health. Instantly I put the cup down.</p>
<p>“What <em>is</em> this filth?”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia frowns at me as I make a face and shove the tea cup back onto the table. Not gently either; a bit slops over the side at which point I’m sure it adhered to the table like glue.</p>
<p>“Well now, how rude! That is perfectly good tea, Miss Ryoka. And it is not poisonous in the slightest.”</p>
<p>I scrub at my tongue with my teeth before I reply.</p>
<p>“It might as well be poison. There’s way too much sugar in that pot!”</p>
<p>“She’s right about that.”</p>
<p>Ressa interjects, voice disapproving. Magnolia glances up at her in clear irritation and drinks from her own cup. It’s got to be the same tea—she’s drinking it like water! And pouring herself another cup!</p>
<p>“You two don’t understand my passions at all. You’re too much like Ressa, dear Ryoka.”</p>
<p>That’s an insult. Ressa and I exchange a glance and then I go back to staring at Magnolia. Once she’s done filling up her own cup, she sighs.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s enough mindless chatter for now.”</p>
<p>She looks at me suddenly, and it’s as if the mask she was wearing, the smiling noble [Lady]—suddenly falls off. All at once I feel pressure in the room, a hot, stifling gaze that sends a chill throughout my body fixing me in place.</p>
<p>This is the true face of Lady Magnolia. But she doesn’t leap at me and tear my eyes out. She just keeps speaking, in that calm, level voice.</p>
<p>“It has been a long time since we last saw each other, hasn’t it?”</p>
<p>It’s hard to speak, but I force my tongue to work.</p>
<p>“I guess. It’s only been about a month? Two?”</p>
<p>“Mm. But so much can happen in so short a time. As I’m sure you’re aware in your profession.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia nods at me. She extends a pinkie and points at my right hand with it.</p>
<p>“I see you have lost something.”</p>
<p>I blink at her and then remember. My fingers. They suddenly ache, and burn with the reminder of their absence. I realize I’m clenching my hand and relax it.</p>
<p>There’s something almost like sympathy in the other woman’s gaze as she looks at me.</p>
<p>“A harsh price to pay. Did you lose it on a delivery?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>She nods as there’s nothing more to say than that.</p>
<p>“You have gone through much, if what I suspect is correct. I know for a fact that you are richer—are you wiser as well, I wonder?”</p>
<p>I don’t respond. I just cross my arms—hiding my stumps under my other arm—and wait. She’s leading the conversation; I’ll let her get to the point.</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia doesn’t seem bothered by my silence. She taps her ring finger on the cup as she stares at me.</p>
<p>“I trust you’ve met Erin Solstice? She was quite a feisty young woman, but I was pleased to meet her, if only briefly.”</p>
<p>No response. I say not a word.</p>
<p>“And Teriarch? I do know you met him. How is the old fool doing? He did mention you to me, you know. Apparently you had a rather interesting conversation.”</p>
<p>Just wait. She’s trying to lure me into conversation. Magnolia eyes me again.</p>
<p>“So, do you have any theory as to why you are here? Any suspicions? Or am I simply the villain in your uncomplicated view of the world?”</p>
<p>My lips are sealed. Magnolia sighs, exasperated.</p>
<p>“Very well, I suppose I should spell it out for you. You are here because I wish to talk to you. And I sent Ressa because you have a habit of refusing to listen to other people. So you have come all this way to have a conversation, with me, Lady Magnolia.”</p>
<p>I just stare at her. I can keep silent. I’ve had teachers, principals, police officers, and my parents all shouting at me. I can stonewall.</p>
<p>Magnolia keeps chattering, though.</p>
<p>“I do enjoy talking. You see, when two people meet, it is customary for them to talk. I understand this may be difficult in your case, and perhaps it is an imposition on your limited mental faculties. However, the custom is that when one person says something—we call this a statement, the other person says something as well, usually in the same vein of topic. This is what we call a reply—”</p>
<p>“I get it. I’ll talk.”</p>
<p>I have a feeling she could do that all day if I didn’t interrupt. Magnolia stops talking and stares at me. Without saying another word.</p>
<p>Great, she’s waiting for me to reply. I roll my eyes, but now the full intensity of her stare is on me. Multiplied by Ressa’s death gaze. Great. I take a breath, and launch into things.</p>
<p>“I guess you’ve gotten the letter I sent you.”</p>
<p>“Letter?”</p>
<p>For a second Magnolia blinks, then her eyes widen.</p>
<p>“Oh, the letter! Yes, I’d nearly forgotten about that!”</p>
<p>“You did?”</p>
<p>That’s odd. I thought this all stemmed from the letter I sent Lady Magnolia by way of Valceif a while ago. I’d expected an immediate response back then, and I’d been prepared to negotiate—</p>
<p>But Lady Magnolia just waves her hand as if that’s ancient history.</p>
<p>“Oh yes, your cryptic little hint that was supposed to intrigue me enough to pursue you. I recall that. It was quite interesting—I wonder, what did you hope to gain from talking with me?”</p>
<p>I’m not sure. It was so long ago—so long and not so long ago. I hadn’t gotten to know the faeries, and I was desperate for something to help both me and Erin.</p>
<p>Magnolia watches my expression, and although I’m sure my face doesn’t change, I know she’s reading my thoughts through that skill of hers. But even if she can do that, there’s a way to beat that skill. Tell the truth.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure what I was thinking. But I was open to talking, back then.”</p>
<p>“Indeed? No doubt you had your own goals. Perhaps you were thinking of selling me some secrets.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps.”</p>
<p>Yeah, that was probably it. Magnolia smiles enigmatically.</p>
<p>“And perhaps I would have taken you up on that offer. But alas, by the time your letter reached me I had already found other people like you. Thus, I had no need to keep searching for you.”</p>
<p>And there it is. Part of the issue’s out in the open at last. I breathe out.</p>
<p>“Yeah. The others. Erin told me you have other people from my world here.”</p>
<p>Not a bat of an eyelid. Lady Magnolia smiles and shrugs.</p>
<p>“Oh yes. They are guests here, for as long as my patience allows. Pestilential, inconsiderate brats that they are, that might not be for too much longer.”</p>
<p>Wow. That’s something. I know Erin said Magnolia didn’t like the others, but—</p>
<p>“Okay, so you have people from my world. You know everything. Why am I here, then?”</p>
<p>“Dead gods. Here we go again.”</p>
<p>To my surprise, Lady Magnolia touches her eyes with one hand and sighs gustily. I stare at her. When she looks up, her irritation is suddenly plain across her face.</p>
<p>“She’s doing it, Ressa. I thought she wouldn’t—but she’s doing it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, milady.”</p>
<p>“First that girl Erin—are all young women from her world inbred, do you think?”</p>
<p>“Doing what?”</p>
<p>“There she goes again!”</p>
<p>Magnolia scowls at me and points accusingly at my chest as if I were some kind of monster.</p>
<p>“Stop asking thoughtless questions! I know you’re not that stupid, Miss Ryoka. Or at least, I hope you’re not because if I have to have <em>another</em> conversation like the one I had with Erin Solstice, I <em>will</em> throw this tea pot at you.”</p>
<p>What’s with her? It’s like a switch has flipped. Suddenly Magnolia Reinhart is all action and no pretense. She glares at me.</p>
<p>“A word of advice, Ryoka Griffin. Few things annoy me as much as feigned ignorance. Do not pretend you don’t know why you are here. You and I both know that I know almost everything. That you come from another world? Obvious. That your world has different technology and inventions? Of course! Your fellow travelers have told me all about the wondrous things of your world—phones, planes, guns, cars—and you know that I have a vested interest in such things.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia drinks more of the sugary liquid that vaguely resembles tea in her cup as she stares at me.</p>
<p>“I know everything. Everything except the details. You know, or you might have guessed that while your friends can chatter on to me about the wonders of guns and warfare as your world practices it, they are remarkably empty-headed when it comes to producing such miracles. It’s rather like having a boastful idiot claim to be able to fly without a shred of evidence to back it up. But you <em>do</em> know how to fly, don’t you, Ryoka Griffin?”</p>
<p>My lips clamp shut. Magnolia eyes me.</p>
<p>“Yes. You do. Or at least, you know more than the others. And you know that is why you are here, Ryoka. I want you to tell me what you know.”</p>
<p>The woman sighs, looking suddenly exhausted.</p>
<p>“So here we are. That skips—how much needless back-and-forth? Honestly, I was willing to play along for a while, but when you started acting like an idiot I lost my patience.”</p>
<p>I just look at her. This is Magnolia Reinhart? Is this her true face? Is she being honest with me for a reason or—</p>
<p>“Well? Say something!”</p>
<p>I barely see it coming. Magnolia flicks her wrist, and suddenly the saucer of the tea cup comes spinning at me. I catch it reflexively.</p>
<p>“What the—?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare ask what that was. It was a <em>saucer.</em> And I threw it at you because I am <em>irate.</em>”</p>
<p>I just stare at her. She’s <em>violent!</em> Is it the sugar working? No—this is a completely different approach. She’s doing this on purpose too! I’ll bet—she’s seized complete hold of the conversation.</p>
<p>Well—fine. Let’s just dive into this. No pretenses, no holds barred. I grit my teeth.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s assume you’re right about everything. In that case, at what point do you strap me to the rack and torture me for information?”</p>
<p>“Torture? Oh, please. Why would I need torture when I can just use magic? Or a Skill?”</p>
<p>Magnolia snorts at me, but she seems mollified by my response. She takes something out of the pocket of her dress and peers at me. For a second I’m thrown—I didn’t even see the cunning pocket sewn into her dress. Well now, she’s not obeying medieval fashion standards with that.</p>
<p>But in her hands—what is that? A monocle? I instantly have a bad feeling about it, and it gets worse when she puts it to her eyes and…studies me.</p>
<p>Yeah, she’s looking at me. And that monocle—</p>
<p>Oh no. Is she reading my mind?</p>
<p>No—she couldn’t be. Think. My mind races as Magnolia peers at me. I’m…pretty sure she can’t read minds, even with an artifact. If she could, she’d wear that thing all the time. It’s definitely for revealing some aspect about me—a lie detector?</p>
<p>Don’t get thrown by it. I fold my arms and wait. But Magnolia seems satisfied. She tucks the monocle back in her secret pocket.</p>
<p>“Hmf. Now, as to getting you to spill your much-vaunted secrets. Tell me, do you really think it would be that difficult for me?”</p>
<p>I hesitate.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Really? How arrogant of you.”</p>
<p>Magnolia rolls her eyes in exasperation. She stares at me with a bit of contempt, or is it disappointment?</p>
<p>“You astound me, Ryoka Griffin. For someone who appears so intelligent—could it be you’ve forgotten my Skills? Surely not.”</p>
<p>She smiles at me, and every hair on the back of my neck tingles.</p>
<p>“I’m curious. What would you do, if I, oh, <span style="color:#fb00ff;"><em>asked you to tell me everything you know?</em></span>”</p>
<p>It’s like lightning. Pink lightning. The words hit me and go inside my head, effortlessly opening the vault of my mind. My mouth opens. I should tell her everything, right? Isn’t that the best—</p>
<p><em>No.</em></p>
<p>I waver, grit my teeth. I’ve felt this before. This…is like Teriarch’s geas spell! God—I <em>did</em> forget she could do this!</p>
<p>Magnolia smiles at me, and puts more intensity into her silken voice.</p>
<p>“Come now. <span style="color:#fb00ff;">You know you want to.</span> This is quite simple for me—if you can’t even stop me from doing this, you are truly foolish. <span style="color:#fb00ff;">Tell me everything, Ryoka Griffin.</span>”</p>
<p>I want to tell her. My jaw is clamped shut, but I can feel the muscles spasming. It’s taking all I’ve got to hold still. Magnolia’s waiting for me to crack. But—I—</p>
<p><em>I’ve done this before!</em></p>
<p>My mouth opens. But what comes out is a wordless shout. I jump up, fist flashing towards Magnolia’s face—</p>
<p>And find myself tumbling backwards onto the couch, ears ringing, pain bursting from my chest and cheek. Ressa’s standing in front of Lady Magnolia, hands raised. I reel backwards and sit down <em>hard</em> on the sofa.</p>
<p>“Um. Well, that was surprising.”</p>
<p>The only sound in the room comes from Lady Magnolia. I can see her blinking at me from behind Ressa. She looks as surprised as I’ve ever seen her. I sit on the couch, staring up at Ressa. I didn’t even see her <em>move.</em> I’m tempted to try and hit her, but—</p>
<p>“Very well, Ressa, please step aside.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia’s hands push at Ressa. The surprised [Maid] moves sideways. Lady Magnolia blinks a few more times, and then looks down at her lap.</p>
<p>“Spilled tea. How wasteful.”</p>
<p>A small pool of tea is puddled in her dress. It’s ruining the expensive pink silk. But to my surprise, Magnolia just sighs and stands up. She shakes the dress—</p>
<p>And the tea slides off it and onto the carpet. I blink. Magnolia catches my eye and shrugs.</p>
<p>“Ward spells on the dress. Prevents staining. Too bad about the tea, though.”</p>
<p>Then she sits down as if nothing has happened and pours herself more tea. I rub at my cheek as Ressa takes a place behind Magnolia again. She’s staring at me hard, but I’m in no mood to fight.</p>
<p>Once there’s a fresh cup of tea in her hands, Magnolia looks at her maid and then at me.</p>
<p>“That was a bit too quick for my eyes, Ressa my dear. Am I right in thinking you stopped her from pummeling me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, milady.”</p>
<p>“I thought as much. Well, I seem to have misjudged you slightly, Ryoka my dear. I thought you might resist my Skill, but nothing as impressive as that. How did you do it, pray? You have no magical items on you—none for that purpose at any rate—and you have no Skills.”</p>
<p>So the monocle was looking at that? I just stare at Magnolia and shrug.</p>
<p>“That’s a secret.”</p>
<p>“Hmf. Well, I’m not too curious so I won’t pry. May I congratulate you, however? It isn’t often that someone has directly struck at me. The last person to do it was, well, your friend, Erin Solstice.”</p>
<p>Erin tried to hit Lady Magnolia? I just blink at her. Magnolia turns to Ressa.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you take a teapot to the face that time?”</p>
<p>“It was to the chest, and it was lukewarm tea.”</p>
<p>“Ah, of course.”</p>
<p>I eye Ressa. The maid eyes me. I definitely feel like the mouse if we’re in a cat and mouse relationship. She got in front of Magnolia from behind the couch before I could hit her. And she hit me in the cheek and chest in an instant.</p>
<p>“Your maid’s quite dedicated.”</p>
<p>That’s code for ‘what kind of freak of nature is your maid’? Magnolia just shrugs at me.</p>
<p>“Of course she is. Ressa possesses many skills, some of which include cleaning and pouring tea—others of which involve preventing people with blades from stabbing me.”</p>
<p>“And that’s normal for a [Maid]?”</p>
<p>“It’s normal for maids under <em>my</em> employ. Do you think I would carelessly walk around—even in my own home—and entertain guests without a bodyguard of some kind?”</p>
<p>“I suppose not.”</p>
<p>“But you didn’t think of it, did you? Really.”</p>
<p>Magnolia sighs and looks at her maid.</p>
<p>“They grow more simpleminded every year, it seems. Erin was like that, wasn’t she, Ressa? She was rather surprising in some ways, but she was as thoughtless as a rock in others.”</p>
<p>Okay, I feel like I should stand up for Erin even if what Magnolia’s saying is true. I grit my teeth and force myself to ignore the stinging pain in my chest and on my cheek.</p>
<p>“Erin is my friend.”</p>
<p>“How wonderful for you.”</p>
<p>Magnolia gives me a look that tells me she could care less. I keep going, ignoring her expression.</p>
<p>“She’s my friend. But I’ll admit she’s also an idiot in some ways. She doesn’t understand your goals. But I do. I know what you want, so let’s get to it.”</p>
<p>“Do you really?”</p>
<p>The other woman eyes me with more skepticism. She shrugs.</p>
<p>“Well then, go on. Enlighten me. What do I so desperately want from you?”</p>
<p>I open my mouth. Magnolia raises a finger.</p>
<p>“However—if you haven’t thought this through, Ressa will beat you <em>quite </em>black and blue.”</p>
<p>“What is your problem with stupid questions?”</p>
<p>I snap at Magnolia and barrel on before she can tell her maid to kick the crap out of me for that question.</p>
<p>“I know what you want. You know about my world by now. You’ve talked with people who’ve told you about guns, bombs, and all of our technology. I know you told Erin you don’t want that information spread, but there’s no way in hell you wouldn’t want to manufacture those kinds of weapons for yourself.”</p>
<p>“Really? And why is that?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it obvious? Fear. Even if no one in your world has weapons yet, what if you run into more people from my world? What if someone else creates guns in secret? If that happens, it’s too late. You <em>need</em> to make weapons or else you’ll be overwhelmed.”</p>
<p>I don’t know how Erin didn’t consider that. For all Magnolia says she can suppress that technology—that’s impossible. But to my surprise, Magnolia doesn’t even bat an eyelash at my answer. Instead, she laughs.</p>
<p>“Good answer! Unfortunately—you are wrong, my dear Ryoka. Right in one way, but terribly wrong in the other.”</p>
<p>What? I stare at Magnolia. She smiles at me, shaking her head.</p>
<p>“You really are new to this world, aren’t you? I sometimes forget—but you really know nothing.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>I’m right. I’m sure of it. But Magnolia clearly thinks I’m wrong. She puts down her tea cup and stretches her fingers out.</p>
<p>“I’m sure you’d say I’m being overconfident. But the truth is, Ryoka Griffin, guns are nothing to fear if it’s just a war we speak of. If one side has guns, they have an advantage, yes, but it does not mean they would necessarily win.”</p>
<p>“You—clearly don’t understand weapons from my world.”</p>
<p>I shake my head, trying to explain to Magnolia how insane her claim is. One side with swords and arrows taking on an army with guns? I suppose if it were guerilla attacks and attrition warfare—but no, she’s wrong!</p>
<p>“Oh? You disagree, Ryoka? Are guns really that fearsome?”</p>
<p>“Of course! They—”</p>
<p>I raise my voice in anger, trying to get Magnolia to understand, to be <em>wary</em> when I hear a slight knock. Instantly, I go silent. Magnolia frowns, and Ressa immediately turns her head to the door. Magnolia raises her voice and calls out.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>The door opens and a maid enters the room. She looks nervous, and nearly freezes up when she sees me, Ressa, and Lady Magnolia all staring at her. But she’s clearly more afraid of doing her job wrong in front of Ressa, so she speaks quickly and clearly while bobbing a curtsy.</p>
<p>“I am extremely sorry to bother you, Lady Reinhart. But your guest—the Great Mage Nemor—requests the pleasure of speaking with you forthwith.”</p>
<p>Great Mage? Is that a class? But Magnolia just frowns, looking irritated.</p>
<p>“Tell him to go away. I’m busy.”</p>
<p>The maid hesitates. But when Ressa glares she immediately bobs a curtsy and closes the door. Magnolia turns back to me, frowning.</p>
<p>“Great Mage Nemor? That’s hardly accurate.”</p>
<p>“Is that someone important?”</p>
<p>My mind’s still on Magnolia’s outrageous claim, but I ask just in case. Magnolia snorts in idle amusement.</p>
<p>“He’s useful, but hardly important—or entertaining. He will wait. Now, go on. You were going to tell me how the armies of your world would destroy mine in an instant. Let’s assume you had an army – or simply the technology from your world. What would make them so fearsome?”</p>
<p>I glare at her. She’s so damn cavalier. Fine. She wants an explanation?</p>
<p>“A tank.”</p>
<p>“A tank? Oh, the others did mention one of them. A metal moving box that fires another type of gun, aren’t they?”</p>
<p>It sounds so simple when Magnolia says it. I shake my head as I try to explain.</p>
<p>“If an army had a tank—just one!—it would be able to destroy thousands of soldiers. A tank has armor that can withstand any number of spells you throw at it. It can hurl an explosion miles away that can demolish a building—”</p>
<p>“A spell can do the same.”</p>
<p>I pause. Magnolia stares at me, one eyebrow raised.</p>
<p>“Your tanks sound slow and cumbersome. Can they really beat a mage hiding in the grass with a [Grand Fireball] spell?”</p>
<p>Grand fireball? Could that destroy a tank? I—hesitate.</p>
<p>“That’s not the point! That’s one tank. But an army could have hundreds. And a mage takes years, decades to train. A soldier with a gun can shoot countless people and he only takes a few days to train. While a mage—”</p>
<p>“Hm. Yes. I see your point.”</p>
<p>Magnolia waves me into silence, not looking daunted in the least. She taps a fingernail on her dress, talking as she does.</p>
<p>“An army of tanks and guns, you say? I still find it hard to imagine, but I am told a gun is like a crossbow that shoots hundreds of bolts per minute, farther than any normal bow. Is that right?”</p>
<p>Pretty much. I nod. Magnolia nods as well.</p>
<p>“Fearsome indeed. But these are just arrows, aren’t they? Excuse me, ‘bullets’. Nonmagical bits of iron. Your…wonderful armies from your world—they lack magic. And that is a crucial flaw. Let us say you have, oh, ten thousand soldiers with guns and several tanks. And any number of your aircrafts as well.”</p>
<p>Magnolia leans over the coffee table, eyes glittering. Her smile has teeth.</p>
<p>“I could destroy an army like that in less than ten minutes.”</p>
<p>I believe her. I stare into Magnolia’s eyes, and I believe she could do it. How? A spell? Enchanted armor? Would enchanted armor even suffer dents? Could you really send a few warriors in plate mail and take down tanks that easily?</p>
<p>“You really don’t fear guns?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say that.”</p>
<p>Magnolia frowns at me irately. She looks as if she’s considering tossing her tea cup at me and then shrugs and goes on.</p>
<p>“Anyone with half a brain knows that a gun is a dangerous weapon. But anyone with a full brain knows that even an army with guns is quite easy to destroy.”</p>
<p>“Oh really?”</p>
<p>“I will hit you, you know. Or rather, order Ressa to do it for me.”</p>
<p>Magnolia glares at me and sighs. She settles back into her seat.</p>
<p>“I can destroy two armies as easily as I can destroy one. That is not the issue.”</p>
<p>She raises one delicate finger.</p>
<p>“One gun, or even ten thousand will not change the world. But a million will.”</p>
<p>I think I get it. Magnolia nods as she goes on.</p>
<p>“I do not want to create guns and other such technologies. I do not want such secrets to spread either. And the reason for that is simple: while such devices might provide power to me in the short term, it will inevitably change the world for the worse. If every [Soldier] has a gun, then it is likely the larger army will prevail. If a child can kill a man in full plate armor, then levels lose much of their meaning.”</p>
<p>“And if anyone can field an army, then you lose your power.”</p>
<p>Magnolia eyes me sternly, as if I’ve missed the point.</p>
<p>“<em>Everyone</em> loses. Don’t you understand? If it becomes an issue of numbers, then the most numerous races will conquer the others. If the balance of power is upset so far, then it will be a war where guns become the only meaningful value. As it is, an army with guns would be a significant threat, but one any world power would be able to deal with.”</p>
<p>She sighs.</p>
<p>“But only if it were an army. If guns were commonplace? In time, guns would dominate everything. In time. A nation able to manufacture more arms of a better quality would inevitably defeat the others. It will lead to a war to end all wars, where the victor will stand upon the corpses of all.”</p>
<p>My blood goes cold as I think of that kind of war. That’s what I envisioned as well. True, there might be ways to change such a war, but in the end it would just be an arms race, and countless battles where people with guns fight people with swords. A bloodbath.</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia seems to agree. She shakes her head.</p>
<p>“What a pointless war. It will occur if word of this technology spreads. A war with your world is one thing; if it occurs it will be inevitable. But if I can, I will prevent this world from seizing such dangerous weapons.”</p>
<p>Can I trust her? I don’t know. But Magnolia seems to have thought this through. She looks at me, and I feel the weight of her gaze pressing down on me, trying to force me to tell the truth, to speak.</p>
<p>“So, here is my most pressing question, one which I believe you will answer. How long will it take for these dangerous weapons to be developed? If one of the people from your world were to cooperate—or give up such information to a powerful individual or nation, how long would it take for them to engineer such inventions?”</p>
<p>The question catches me off guard. For a second I’m not sure if I should answer it. But from what Magnolia’s said—I do some quick calculations. I’m obviously not an expert in firearms, but let’s think about it rationally. If someone needed to find all the ingredients of gunpowder, sulfur, saltpeter, charcoal—and secure them as a long-term resource…testing…building prototypes…</p>
<p>“You could probably have a prototype gun ready in less than a month if you had a kingdom’s worth of resources at your disposal. But a gun that’s ready for war? A proper gun? An army? That would take years.”</p>
<p>The more dangerous route would be a cannon. That’s easier to make, honestly. I share that with Magnolia and she nods thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“A cannon? Intriguing. But if that’s anything like a trebuchet, it’s not as much of a problem.”</p>
<p>She’s so…<em>calm</em> about this. I just stare at Magnolia, a woman unafraid of guns or cannons. She stares back.</p>
<p>“Well, a year is more than enough time for me to locate any signs of manufacturing. But just to be sure—name one of the components of this ‘gunpowder’ for me, if you would.”</p>
<p>Instantly, I shut my mouth. Magnolia just sighs loudly.</p>
<p>“Don’t be obstinate. I said <em>one</em> component. I am hardly inclined to go around searching for how to make the stuff if I could just torture it out of you. And since I am not going to…”</p>
<p>She’s right. I have to trust her. Reluctantly, I open my mouth.</p>
<p>“Sulfur.”</p>
<p>Both of Magnolia’s eyebrows shoot upwards. She exchanges a glance I can’t read with Ressa.</p>
<p>“Ah. <em>That’s</em> troubling.”</p>
<p>“What? Why’s that?”</p>
<p>The woman just stares at me and raises an eyebrow again.</p>
<p>“If I told you, could you even help? No? Then I won’t.”</p>
<p>That—she knows something, doesn’t she? Someone’s already making a move on sulfur! Does that mean the secret’s out? Can she stop it? My head’s racing, but the cooler part of me doesn’t panic. Magnolia’s right. I can’t do anything. I have to…trust her.</p>
<p>Trust that she’s telling the truth. So reluctantly I put that out of my mind and stare at Magnolia. Everything seems, well, good so far.</p>
<p>That’s worrying. I can’t have been called here just to talk about weapons and how useless they might be right now. No—there’s something else.</p>
<p>“Is that it? If you don’t want weapons, then why <em>am</em> I here?”</p>
<p>Magnolia pauses as she reaches for the tea pot. Ressa, gently pulling said pot <em>out </em>of Magnolia’s reach, meeting her mistress’s gaze.</p>
<p>“Was that a foolish question, do you think, Ressa?”</p>
<p>“It seems reasonable to me. She does not know you.”</p>
<p>“Ah, well, we’ll let it slide.”</p>
<p>Magnolia turns back to me and gives me a beaming smile.</p>
<p>“Of course you’re not here just to talk about weapons, my dear idiotic Ryoka. But I thought it would be best to set your mind at ease first.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to ignore that. Once.”</p>
<p>“How intelligent. Now, would you like to ask the obvious question? I promise I won’t order Ressa to hit you.”</p>
<p>“Fine. Why <em>am</em> I here? What do you want to know?”</p>
<p>Magnolia smiles at me. Her eyes sparkle, and she sits up, the very image of a dignified [Lady]. Her reply is quick, decisive, insane.</p>
<p>“Ice cream.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>There must have been something in the pot. That’s why Ressa’s engaged in a silent tug-of-war with Magnolia. Or else she just doesn’t want her boss’s teeth to fall out. But Magnolia abandons the tea pot to look seriously at me.</p>
<p>“I just want ice cream. And cake. We have some types of cake—not nearly as good as yours, mind you, but something similar to what I have heard described. But the other children tell me it is possible to make an ice cream <em>cake.</em> I would like to try that, and frosting. And whipped cream. And cotton candy.”</p>
<p>Oh my god. She’s got a <em>sweet tooth.</em> I mean, I knew that already. But she brought me—here—over four hundred miles—</p>
<p>I put my head in my hands. This can’t be happening. But it is. And when I think about it…</p>
<p>I look up sharply.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“No?”</p>
<p>Magnolia looks hurt, and offended.</p>
<p>“Whyever not? This is hardly a secret worth keeping, Ryoka Griffin. Compared to a gun, what is a mint, chocolate chip, cookies and cream, caramel ice cream sundae with sprinkles?”</p>
<p>I want to vomit just listening to her. But I read past her trite words to the deeper meaning below them.</p>
<p>“It’s not just ice cream and desserts you want, is it? It might start that way, but after you ask for recipes, you’ll ask me about other technologies from my world. Little inventions and innovations that can help everyone.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia pauses. She looks at me, sighs, and then looks at her maid.</p>
<p>“Ah. She figured it out.”</p>
<p>“She is not a complete idiot, milady.”</p>
<p>I stare at the two of them, filled with grim certainty all of a sudden. Now I get it. Their tones are light, but I know they’re watching me. Lady Magnolia still looks genuinely disappointed, though.</p>
<p>“You are correct, intelligent Miss Ryoka Griffin. In truth, I was going to have you explain to one of my [Chefs] how to make all kinds of treats before I got to the rest. I have a larder stocked with countless ingredients if you’d want to…? Ah, it’s too late. How tragic.”</p>
<p>She sighs dramatically.</p>
<p>“At least the other girls know how to make cake. But no one can tell me how cotton candy is made! But you are quite right. That would only be the start of what I ask of you.”</p>
<p>First comes cotton candy. Then comes steam engines, or crop rotation. Or the periodic table. Plastic, sporks, bicycles…</p>
<p>None of this is bad stuff. In fact, I think if I could introduce this kind of technology to the world I would. But not through her. Not through this woman.</p>
<p>There’s more than one kind of power. And giving Magnolia Reinhart a monopoly on every invention from the medieval ages to the modern one? It might even be worse than teaching her how to make a gun.</p>
<p>“You want me to help you become even richer than you already are, is that it?”</p>
<p>“Rich enough to buy a Walled City. That would be a nice start.”</p>
<p>Magnolia smiles at me, like a proud parent watching over a child. I want to kick her in the face, but Ressa’s watching me.</p>
<p>“You figured it out—well done! Guns are an unstable bit of technology, but it is hard to take over the world with—what did the others call it? Parfait? It sounds delicious, and I’m sure it will earn me tens of thousands of gold coins when one of them finally figures out how it is made.”</p>
<p>It’s sick. It’s stupid. It doesn’t sound right. But the scariest and most powerful person in this world right now isn’t a general with an army of tanks. It’s a business magnate who wants to orchestrate the biggest monopoly and buyout the world’s ever seen.</p>
<p>Money. If Magnolia Reinhart is known for one thing, it’s money. If she had unlimited funds—she could buy out every mercenary on the continent, fund unlimited armies. Money is power, and even if the power of money isn’t unlimited, it’s scary.</p>
<p>Now you know, Ryoka. You know her twisted, wicked, sugar-based schemes. Now how are you going to get out of this?</p>
<p>“I wonder. How indeed?”</p>
<p>It’s like she can read my mind. I stare at Magnolia, but her face is innocent. Did she really…?</p>
<p>No, she can sense my intentions. She can probably sense that I want to leave and extrapolated from there. But…that’s still really scary.</p>
<p>“And the worst part is, I am clearly an ally of sorts, aren’t I, Ryoka Griffin? I can stop the world from using guns. But as for the rest…”</p>
<p>I still can’t trust her. That’s my conclusion. I stare at Magnolia Reinhart and feel my heart begin to beat faster. It’s like a drum in my chest, thunder in my veins, a knock at the door—</p>
<p>“Again?”</p>
<p>Magnolia turns towards the door, frowning in genuine irritation. I stare at the door too, and see the same unfortunate maid poke her head in. She looks pale—and she goes ghostly when she sees Magnolia’s frown.</p>
<p>“I am so sorry—”</p>
<p>“Get to the point.”</p>
<p>Ressa snaps and the maid curtsies as if she were ducking a bullet.</p>
<p>“The mage—he’s demanding to see you, Lady Reinhart. He won’t take no for an answer—”</p>
<p>“Tell Nemor that if he does not sit still and wait for me to summon him, I will throw him out of my estate.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia’s voice is impatient, and she clearly means every word. The maid gulps, but takes one look at Ressa and clearly decides that arguing with a mage would be a lot more fun.</p>
<p>The door closes and Magnolia turns back to me with a sigh.</p>
<p>“I believe dear Nemor will regret that when we meet. In fact, I am sure of it. I don’t even know why he’s calling on me today.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you talk to him? I was just leaving…”</p>
<p>I stand up, making a show of dusting myself off. Lady Magnolia smiles at me.</p>
<p>“Oh no. <em>Sit.</em>”</p>
<p>It’s too fast for me. My legs fold up and I sit. I glare at the woman, but she just chuckles.</p>
<p>“You can’t get away that easily, Ryoka. And even if my Skill doesn’t work—there <em>are</em> truth spells and even potions, you know.”</p>
<p>This is bad. I eye Ressa, and remember the potions and bags on my belt. But those are good against enemies who can’t move faster than I can see. And I’m sitting in the mansion itself.</p>
<p>No—I knew fighting was a bad idea. I take a deep breath.</p>
<p>“You cannot keep me here.”</p>
<p>“Oh? That’s a bold statement to make.”</p>
<p>Don’t I know it. I meet Magnolia Reinhart’s gaze squarely. She studies me—not with arrogance and overconfidence like some helpful movie villain, but calculatingly.</p>
<p>“Hm. You have a plan, don’t you? Well, go on. I like to be entertained.”</p>
<p>“I won’t help you.”</p>
<p>“Even if all I want are inventions that will help everyone?”</p>
<p>“Even then. Because that would mean placing too much power in just your hands. Too much wealth.”</p>
<p>“And this is a bad thing because?”</p>
<p>“Absolute power corrupts absolutely. No one person should be entrusted with all that.”</p>
<p>“My power is hardly absolute.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia looks amused, but then her gaze sharpened. Her eyes prick at my skin like knives.</p>
<p>“But I take your point. You don’t trust me. But tell me, Ryoka Griffin. How will you <em>stop</em> me from doing what I please? I already have many travellers from your world who know of wondrous inventions. I only need you to fill in the gaps, and then my [Blacksmiths], [Carpenters], [Mages], and [Alchemists] will do the rest. I even know [Engineers].”</p>
<p>All the things she needs to reverse-engineer any number of gadgets. I swallow hard.</p>
<p>“But you need me. What if I’m not here?”</p>
<p>“Oh? And how will you stop me?”</p>
<p>Legit question. My eyes travel to the window. I have three ways to get out of here. Three bargaining chips. The first—</p>
<p>Is hovering outside, making faces at me. I grin.</p>
<p>“I’ve got friends who bow to no [Lord] or [Lady] or even [King].”</p>
<p>I point to the window. Magnolia and Ressa turn—and see Ivolethe. The tiny faerie waves at me, and taps her ears. She can hear us? Even better.</p>
<p>“Um.”</p>
<p>A voice interrupts me. I stare at Magnolia. She’s looking at the window and me with a blank expression.</p>
<p>“What is it exactly that I should be staring at?”</p>
<p>I open my mouth…and nearly swallow my tongue.</p>
<p>She can’t see Frost Faeries. Suddenly I feel like an idiot. But then Ressa’s eyes narrow, and she tucks a hand into her skirt.</p>
<p>“Magnolia, step back.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>To her credit Magnolia vacates the couch even as she says that. She stands behind Ressa, suddenly wary as the maid stares at the window.</p>
<p>“What is it, Ressa? Something invisible?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Ressa stares hard at a spot just to the left of Ivolethe. The faerie is just grinning, grinning at me. She’s got one hand raised and she points to Magnolia and Ressa. Then she draws a finger across her throat. Where’d she learn that? But for once I’m in full agreement. I nod slightly and she laughs outside the glass.</p>
<p>“There is a Winter Sprite outside the window.”</p>
<p>“A Frost Faerie? Really?”</p>
<p>Magnolia squints at the window and then gasps. Instantly she looks at me, eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“Now isn’t <em>that</em> interesting?”</p>
<p>I feel uneasy. She—shouldn’t be this calm. Ressa’s certainly treating Ivolethe like a threat. And for good reason.</p>
<p>My tiny friend has been flying around the glass, making faces only I can see. But after I gave her my plea for help, she acts. She flies up to the window around head height, and puts her hand on the glass pane.</p>
<p>Instantly, the window becomes frosty. Magnolia gasps—not really in alarm—and Ressa immediately tenses. But what can she do against a force of nature?</p>
<p>The frost from the window grows deeper, and suddenly ice begins to form, thickening on the pane. Slowly, it begins to spread into the room, and I feel the temperature drop like a stone. More ice begins to spread from the window. Is Ivolethe trying to trap Ressa and Magnolia? What about me? If the window breaks—could I jump for it?</p>
<p>I’m tense, my hand on the smoke bag Octavia made for me. I’m watching Ressa, ready to move. And she’s looking from the window to me. It’ll all be settled in a moment—</p>
<p>“That’s quite enough.”</p>
<p>Magnolia’s voice makes all of us pause in place. Even Ivolethe blinks as Magnolia steps out from behind Ressa. The taller woman moves to block her, but Magnolia just pushes her aside.</p>
<p>“I will handle this, Ressa.”</p>
<p>She steps up to the frozen window, where I can see Ivolethe reflected through the clear ice. Magnolia stares a bit past Ivolethe, but she shows not a tiny shred of fear in front of the faerie. But—she’s just a [Lady], right? And Ivolethe isn’t inside—</p>
<p>I tell myself Magnolia’s powerless. But I can’t help but feel uneasy. And there’s a twinge of uncertainty even on the faerie’s immortal face. She stares at Magnolia. Magnolia just sighs.</p>
<p>“How on earth did Ryoka meet a creature like you? Well, I’d love to chat, but I’m told on very good authority that you lot are troublemakers. I can’t have that right now. Kindly go away or I’ll have to make you leave.”</p>
<p>Ivolethe stares at Lady Magnolia incredulously. Possibly no one has ever talked to a Frost Faerie that way before—at least, not for long. She thinks for a second, then makes an unmistakable gesture and conjures a snowball.</p>
<p>Ressa seems to <em>blink</em> in front of Magnolia as the snowball smacks into the glass in front of the woman. But Magnolia doesn’t even flinch. She sighs, and then she raises her voice. Gone is the normal tone, her light and friendly air. Her eyes are filled with that same intensity, and her tone booms and cracks like distant thunder.</p>
<p>“I am Lady Magnolia. This mansion and the land around are mine. You are not welcome here. <em>Begone.</em>”</p>
<p>I feel her last word in my <em>bones</em>. The effect on Ivolethe is immediate. She flies <em>screaming</em> out of Magnolia’s courtyard as if she’s been set on fire. I see her faint azure form flitting high, high into the sky until it disappears. Magnolia watches until Ivolethe’s gone and then turns back to me.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s that. Did you have any other allies, or was that it?”</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>I—</p>
<p>Was that—?</p>
<p>Uh oh.</p>
<p>Ressa’s staring at me now too, and the look in her eyes says that she’s going to beat me into a pulp the first chance she gets. The ice Ivolethe conjured isn’t going away; rather, it’s beginning to melt off the walls.</p>
<p>“I do hope you had another plan. I’ll admit this one is novel, but it’s rather short-sighted, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Magnolia smiles at me, eyes still filled with that horrible authority. Part of me wants to give in or run just looking at her.</p>
<p>But the rest is resolute. This woman can’t have her way.</p>
<p>Trump card. Trump card. I take a breath and pray like hell what Erin told me was on a level. I open up with my second trump card to play.</p>
<p>“You can’t keep me here. I have something important to do.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Something important? Running deliveries? Delivering a birthday message and a ring? Helping Erin? Do tell.”</p>
<p>Oh, that smile. I smile back at Magnolia and notice hers wanes a tiny bit.</p>
<p>“Not Erin or adventurers. I have to convince the Antinium not to go to war.”</p>
<p>For a second—oh, for a lovely, wonderful second, I have the pleasure of watching Magnolia’s smile vanish. Her eyes widen, and she stares at me.</p>
<p>The one upside to verbally sparring with someone who can sense your intentions? They know when you’re not lying.</p>
<p>The glorious moment of seeing Magnolia Reinhart uncertain lasts for a heartbeat. Then she looks over my shoulder.</p>
<p>“Ressa.”</p>
<p>I don’t even see the woman. I don’t even get a chance to react. Her hand grabs mine and suddenly I’m in an arm-lock that’s an inch of force away from breaking my arm. I can <em>feel</em> my tendons tearing.</p>
<p>“Don’t break her arm yet, Ressa. But be wary.”</p>
<p>I barely hear Magnolia over the pain. Arm lock. I’m in—I know how to counter. But if I do—</p>
<p><em>Gah! </em>I don’t move. After a second that feels like forever I see Magnolia step back from me. I know she’s staring at me.</p>
<p>“Please explain that sentence, Ryoka Griffin.”</p>
<p>Arm is agony. Pain is—all consuming. But I force the words out, nearly choking on them.</p>
<p>“The Antinium are not your enemy.”</p>
<p>Pause. The pressure on my arm isn’t reduced. Can I hear my bones creaking?</p>
<p>“Go on.”</p>
<p>Maybe it’s the pain, but I let my mouth do the talking.</p>
<p>“What do you mean go on? I said, they’re not your enemy? Don’t you understand that you id—<em>argh!</em>”</p>
<p>Ressa twists my arm up a bit more. I shout in pain, but I’m afraid to move. Magnolia sighs.</p>
<p>“Ressa, she’s not lying. Let her go.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“I am. She’s not lying. And if she’s telling the truth—”</p>
<p>The pressure releases all at once. I stumble forwards, feeling at my arm. The pain isn’t gone. It’s—</p>
<p>I’ve got a potion at my belt. I wrench it out and unstopper it with one hand. Some goes on my shirt, the floor—the rest hits my arm. Instantly, the throbbing, burning pain ceases. I turn and stare at Ressa.</p>
<p>And…a dagger. She has one in her right hand. It looks very sharp. And magical. I’m assuming the green tint to the edge of the blade is magic. Maybe it’s poison. Poison magic?</p>
<p>“Put the blade away, Ressa.”</p>
<p>Magnolia sighs as she stares at both me and Ressa. Slowly, very slowly, the maid tucks the blade up the sleeve of her uniform. She stares at me. I watch her.</p>
<p>“I’m sitting down.”</p>
<p>Magnolia’s voice makes both of us start. She steps over to the couch and sits down in it. Then she swivels, and puts her feet up on the edge of the couch as if she’s on a therapist’s couch. She stares at me.</p>
<p>“Well? Explain.”</p>
<p>I don’t need to be told twice. Rubbing at my arm, I take a seat. Ressa silently walks behind Magnolia. Both women stare at me, waiting for me to speak.</p>
<p>“The Antinium aren’t your enemies. Not necessarily, at any rate.”</p>
<p>I look at them. Nothing. Well, they’re good listeners when things are serious. I take a deep breath.</p>
<p>“The shortest way to explain this is that the Antinium’s true enemy isn’t you. They fought two wars here, but to them, this is only a—a skirmish. A lull before the larger war. They don’t want this continent, I think. They’re just getting ready for their real enemy to emerge.”</p>
<p>“And what’s that?”</p>
<p>“A god.”</p>
<p>How easy it is to say. How…easy. And it slips off the tongue as if it means nothing. Perhaps it does to most people in this world. I can’t even begin to understand what it means myself. But Magnolia Reinhart hears this and the look on her face changes again. This time, I think I see fear.</p>
<p>“Impossible.”</p>
<p>Magnolia says that word flatly. Her eyes are locked on mine.</p>
<p>“The gods are dead.”</p>
<p>I shake my head.</p>
<p>“Tell that to the Antinium. Tell that to the Queens. They fled Rhir because they were fighting something they believed was a god. Or do you think the Antinium would run from any other opponent?”</p>
<p>Pause. Stare. Ressa’s looking at me now, not with hostility, but something approaching genuine worry. She looks at her mistress. Magnolia closes her eyes for seven seconds. What she thinks in that time I don’t know. But when she opens her eyes—</p>
<p>“How do you know? This must have come from a credible source. And I don’t believe the Queen would talk to you. If this came from a Worker—”</p>
<p>“No Worker.”</p>
<p>I shake my head.</p>
<p>“Klbkch. He’s a Prognugator in the Antinium Hive based in Liscor—”</p>
<p>“Klbkch the Slayer.”</p>
<p>The word escapes Magnolia’s lips. She sits up on the couch and stares at Ressa. Something unspoken passes between the two, and then they look back at me. Magnolia’s voice is serious when she speaks next.</p>
<p>“You have my full and undivided attention, Ryoka Griffin. For the moment I’ll believe everything you say. Do not waste this chance.”</p>
<p>“So you believe me?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes. At least, I believe you are telling the truth. And if it was Klbkch the Slayer who told you this…”</p>
<p>Magnolia’s voice trails off. Ressa looks at her, worried.</p>
<p>“Does this change the plans?”</p>
<p>The other woman nods, shortly. She even laughs, but not with any pleasure.</p>
<p>“Of course. It changes…everything. It changes the entire world.”</p>
<p>She looks back at me, about to ask another question. Then someone knocks. The door opens.</p>
<p>“Lady Reinhart? The [Mage]—”</p>
<p>This time Magnolia doesn’t wait. She grabs the tea pot and <em>hurls </em>it at the door.</p>
<p>“<em>Get out!</em>”</p>
<p>I see the tea pot shatter, but before the pieces even hit the floor, the maid has fled. Calmly, as if nothing happened, Magnolia turns back to me.</p>
<p>“You were saying Klbkch the Slayer told you this?”</p>
<p>“You know him?”</p>
<p>Magnolia’s face is grim as she nods.</p>
<p>“I know him. I have seen him on the battlefield. Perhaps before that, but we met for one brief moment during the Second Antinium War.”</p>
<p>“The Second Antinium War?”</p>
<p>I only read about the first one. Damn. The second one was mentioned, but I think I lost the book that talked about it. Magnolia frowns at me, and then looks at her maid.</p>
<p>“Ressa, fetch the book for me.”</p>
<p>It’s clear which one she means. Ressa walks out of the room, and Magnolia turns back to me.</p>
<p>“Tell me the rest.”</p>
<p>I do, as concisely as I can in the time it takes Ressa to return. Magnolia keeps interrupting me, but when her maid is standing by her side with a slim book in her hands, she sighs and accepts it. She looks at the book before handing it to me.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“The history of the Antinium, all the information known about their culture, and a history of both the first and second Antinium Wars.”</p>
<p>Magnolia taps the cover as I hold it in my hands. I read the title. <em>The Antinium: A Brief History by Krsysl Wordsmith.</em> The name is familiar to me.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t he the one who wrote about the First Antinium War?”</p>
<p>“He was.”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia nods as I tuck the book into the bag of holding at my side. She notes it, but makes no comment. I guess the Antinium really do trump all other concerns.</p>
<p>“I funded his research and the book. I would advise you to read it, the history of the Second Antinium War in particular, especially if you are going to be working with Klbkch.”</p>
<p>Huh. I look up at Magnolia, surprised.</p>
<p>“So you’re going to let me go?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t I say I hated stupid questions?”</p>
<p>The woman scowls at me, but weakly. Her heart’s not in it any longer. Ressa looks at her and Magnolia nods wearily.</p>
<p>“That’s right, Miss Ryoka who knows too much. You win. If there is a slight chance—however slight!—that there could be a way to avoid a war with the Antinium, I would take it. And the knowledge that there is dissent within the Hives—from a Prognugator no less? Invaluable. Even more invaluable is the knowledge of what the Antinium fear. If there is a god—”</p>
<p>She breaks off and shakes her head. Then she fixes me with a gaze like diamonds.</p>
<p>“You have changed everything I seek to do, Ryoka. Do you know that?”</p>
<p>I meet her gaze.</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“From this moment on, you and I must be allies. We must be, because I must pursue peace with the Antinium and find out more of what they know, and because you will not live with me as your enemy. I promise you that.”</p>
<p>Magnolia’s eyes are hard as she captures mine. I can’t help it. I swallow, but that’s all. I don’t look away.</p>
<p>“So, what should we do? As allies? I trust you won’t be keeping me here or extorting information against my will?”</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia smiles.</p>
<p>“On the contrary. If we’re allies you should be giving that to me for free. But we can…negotiate that later. For now, you are officially my guest. That means I feed you, in case you were wondering. I’ll even allow that Winter Sprite back on my estate, if you can find her. I would like to talk to her as well, if that is possible.”</p>
<p>Wow. Suddenly, everything’s changed. I shift in my seat. What should I explore first? Does this mean what I think it does? If I have an ally—</p>
<p>The wall explodes. Mortar and stone blast outwards in a single thunderous impact that sends the couches, tables, and me flying. I windmill through the air, trying to curl and reduce the impact. No good. I hit something hard and then I think the world stops for a second.</p>
<p>I don’t know. All I do know is that when the pain and shock stop long enough for thought to shakily resume, I’m pulling myself up. Something in my thigh. A fragment of stone. Deep. I don’t feel anything broken—but everything hurts.</p>
<p>“What…?”</p>
<p>I look around. The room is in ruins. The wall’s gone—and a huge stretch of corridor gapes at me. But what I see in the center of the room is more important.</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia and Ressa are standing in the center of the room. Untouched. Even their clothes aren’t ruffled. It’s like…the explosion didn’t hit them. I see a radiant nimbus around both of them.</p>
<p>Shield spell?</p>
<p>But someone else is standing there too. A man in robes. He’s…tall. I feel like throwing up. But magic shines around him, so strong I can see it. He blew up the wall.</p>
<p>And he’s talking. I hear his voice dimly over the ringing in my ears.</p>
<p>“Magnolia Reinhart. The Circle of Thorns seeks your life.”</p>
<p>He must be the Great Mage Nemor. I try to get up and collapse. My leg—</p>
<p>Magnolia Reinhart stares at the mage. She looks around at the destruction. Her eyes linger on me for a second, and then she stares back at the mage.</p>
<p>“Well.”</p>
<p>It’s just one word. She’s not afraid—rather, her eyes are full of cold fury. But aside from Ressa she is alone. And even as I watch I see a shadow move. An [Assassin] steps out of the darkness as if he’s a ghost. And more—they flit towards her. Surrounding…more…</p>
<p>I can’t breathe. I have to warn her. Ressa’s standing with her back to Magnolia, tense. But—there’s too many. And yet Magnolia is not afraid. She looks at the mage. Looks down at him.</p>
<p>“The Circle of Thorns? You have my full attention.”</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I think I have a concussion. The world is spinning and I want to puke. Then again, maybe that’s just how being thrown across a room by an explosion always feels.</p>
<p>I don’t know. I haven’t had much experience with that up until now. And I hope it never happens again.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>I try to move and just sort of flop over. I’m partially covered with bits of fallen masonry, so no one in the room notices me twitching. Which is good in this case, because it’s sort of <em>tense</em> right now.</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia and Ressa are standing in what used to be her sitting room, surrounded by assassins. Excuse me. [Assassins] and one assassin who happens to be a mage. He’s dressed up in colorful yellow robes with green slashes down the sides. He glows with magic. But the [Assassins]—</p>
<p>Shadows, some of them. Others just look like blurs and I’m sure there are more I can’t see. Only a few even look remotely humanoid. Best guess? They’re high level and they’ve got magical items as well.</p>
<p>And they’re all armed. I’m sure of that. They’re backing up the mage, but they haven’t attacked yet. The idiot—the Great Mage Nemor I think is his name—is talking. He’s actually gloating, like a movie villain.</p>
<p>“—Never thought I’d live to see the day when I would finally humble the arrogant Reinharts once and for all.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think you’ll live to see that day either. But one can always hope, I suppose.”</p>
<p>That’s Magnolia for you. Surrounded by death and she’s got more attitude than anyone I’ve ever met. It makes me almost like her.</p>
<p>I look groggily at the scene. Lots of badness over there. That’s my general assessment. I could…use a potion? Smokescreen bag? Flour bomb?</p>
<p>All of my instincts tell me that trying anything will get me instantly killed. So instead of doing anything stupid—like usual—I just lie on the ground and watch things play out*.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Yeah, not my most heroic moment. But in my defense, I did just get tossed into a wall. It hurt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“—Arrogance will do you little in the end.”</p>
<p>Oh, they’re still talking? Don’t assassins generally make less noise? But this Nemor guy seems to want to get the final word in. He juts out his chin—he’s got a small goatee which looks immaculately oiled and groomed. It suits his narrow, pointed face. He clearly wants to look like a great mage, but aside from the blowing stuff up part, he doesn’t really look that impressive.</p>
<p>Granted, that last bit does a lot for him, but even so. Words are not his strong point.</p>
<p>“Grovel, Reinhart. If you do, I may make your end quick.”</p>
<p>“Oh please.”</p>
<p>Magnolia rolls her eyes heavenwards.</p>
<p>“Do us all a favor and <em>shut up</em>, Nemor. You always were insufferable even when you were just casting ward spells for me. If you’re not going to tell me what this Circle of Thorns wants, kindly die without speaking, would you?”</p>
<p>The mage’s face turns red. He opens his mouth—but he never gets a chance to retort. One of the shadows standing in the ruined hallways moves. The [Assassin] charges at Lady Magnolia <em>fast—</em>faster than I could ever move. He’s got a dagger in his hand as he lunges as Magnolia’s chest.</p>
<p>But the blade never touches her. I see a blur, and then Ressa is in the way. She blocks the strike with her own unarmored chest. I nearly shout as I expect to see her body pierced by the thrust.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t happen. Instead, I see the shimmering aura around her body—the magical shield that protected both her and Lady Magnolia—brighten. I hear a man scream, and the [Assassin] suddenly stumbles back, clutching a stump of a hand already spurting blood.</p>
<p>What was that? His hand <em>vanished</em> as it approached Ressa’s body! And now Ressa moves—the unfortunate [Assassin] chokes as her fingers go <em>into</em> his neck. She pulls her hand back and he folds over. I feel my stomach heave as I see what happened. Part of his face is just gone, vaporized by whatever magical shield is on Ressa.</p>
<p>The other [Assassins] move even as the first one dies. Two lunge at Ressa, but she <em>blurs </em>and they retreat as I hear metal clashing. One tosses the remains of a blade to the ground—all but the handle is vaporized. The others attack from a safer distance. Darts, throwing stars, knives—they hurl them at both Ressa and Magnolia. All the projectiles vanish before they touch either woman’s body.</p>
<p>Ressa flicks her hand and I see dark blurs speed at the [Assassins]. At least one hits, but even the blurred shape I see stagger doesn’t fall. They blink backwards as Ressa immediately steps back to Magnolia, guarding her back.</p>
<p>Standoff again. The [Assassins] pause and then wait, as if nothing happened. Nemor stares at them, and his face only now goes red as his mind catches up to what just happened.</p>
<p>“You fools! Hold until I command it! I must bypass her protection spells first!”</p>
<p>He shouts at the others around him, not even seeming bothered by the magical disintegration field. Magnolia sighs calmly, not even ruffled by the sudden burst of violence.</p>
<p>“A proper mage would have done that first rather than sending that poor man to his death. But then again, a proper [Assassin] wouldn’t have attacked so recklessly to begin with.”</p>
<p>She points at one of the shadows, and they shift, as if they’re afraid to be directly addressed by her.</p>
<p>“You have some rather showy magical items and Skills, but none of you are master [Assassins]. Believe me, I can tell the difference. Who sent you to die here?”</p>
<p>No response. I just see the shadows and blurred figures flitting around Magnolia, as if suddenly unsure. She scowls at them, impatient and not afraid.</p>
<p>“Well? <span style="color:#fb00ff;"><em>Answer me.</em></span>”</p>
<p>“We were—”</p>
<p>The words come out of one of the shadows unwillingly. I hear a female voice, and then she <em>gurgles</em> as one of her fellows strikes her in the throat. She chokes and falls back, but says no more.</p>
<p>Magnolia scowls again. She points at Nemor, who’s gone red again with rage.</p>
<p>“Who ordered you to work with this fool? I was under the impression your Guild didn’t collaborate with amateurs.”</p>
<p>“Fool!? For the last time, you insult me. Magnolia—”</p>
<p>“<span style="color:#fb00ff;"><em>Be silent, Nemor.</em></span>”</p>
<p>I see the man recoil as if struck. Nemor’s hands go up to his throat and his face goes red, then purple. Calmly, Magnolia turns back to the [Assassins].</p>
<p>“Was it your Guildmaster? Or someone else? <span style="color:#fb00ff;">Tell me who sent you.</span>”</p>
<p>This time they’re ready. I see a few of the [Assassins] shift, but none of them speak. But the idiot—Great Mage, rather—sneers and answers instead. His face is regaining some of his color. Looks like he also shook off the charm spell. Damn. Is it really that easy?</p>
<p>“There are more factions that seek your life than you know, Reinhart.”</p>
<p>She pauses, and looks at him.</p>
<p>“Hm. So that means the Guild <em>didn’t </em>officially sanction this. Well, thank you for telling me, Nemor.”</p>
<p>Never before have I seen a man look so angry and worried at the same time. Nemor’s face turns amazingly maroon with rage. He hisses at Magnolia.</p>
<p>“I will see you suffer before you die.”</p>
<p>“And I see there’s little more to be learned here. Well then, shall we be about the business of the day?”</p>
<p>Magnolia turns to the [Assassins]. Immediately, I see them ready their weapons. But she doesn’t reach for a weapon. Rather, Magnolia folds her hands together. She’s not wearing gloves and her dress probably isn’t concealing a weapon. I just see a few rings on her bare hands. She looks around the room, as if searching for a spot to properly fight.</p>
<p>I tense as her eyes spot me lying on the ground, but Magnolia doesn’t even acknowledge my presence. Her gaze sweeps over me as if I’m not there. Magnolia shakes her head slightly as she turns and speaks casually to Nemor and the [Assassins].</p>
<p>“Not here, I think. There are too many valuable antiques that would need replacing. If you would follow me…?”</p>
<p>She doesn’t move, but her hand turns one of the rings on her fingers. I hear a curse—Nemor raises his hands and several [Assassins] have already thrown more weapons—but it’s too late. Magnolia and Ressa both vanish from sight in an instant.</p>
<p>“Teleportation!?”</p>
<p>Nemor exclaims in surprise. I see several shadows streak down the corridor in an instant, but the mage’s shout draws some of them back.</p>
<p>“No—wait.”</p>
<p>He points at the spot where Magnolia and Ressa have gone, thinking out loud.</p>
<p>“There’s no spell circle. And no one can teleport long distances so quickly. This fast—they must be headed to a prearranged destination. Spread out and find them!”</p>
<p>Way to state the obvious, genius. I get the impression that Nemor’s not actually in charge of these [Assassins], and that’s clearly for good reason. The other shadows just streak down the corridors—two run past me to the exposed opening. I hear another voice, a man’s, from one of the shadows.</p>
<p>“Outside.”</p>
<p>I don’t know how, but all of the [Assassin]’s silhouettes immediately return and make a beeline for the exposed opening. They disappear into the night air, leaping or vanishing over the edge. Nemor runs after them, cursing, and I see him jump off the broken ledge as well. His body glows, and he falls much more slowly than gravity should allow.</p>
<p>What’s happening? Is it safe? I don’t know. Part of me wants to stay here, but—I have to see what’s going on. Slowly, painfully, I crawl out of my lovely blanket of broken wall fragments.</p>
<p><em>Don’t stand.</em> <em>Just crawl</em>. I worm my way over to the void where the wall used to be, exposed by Nemor’s spell. And then I see her again.</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia.</p>
<p>She’s standing in the center of her courtyard, bold as you please. She didn’t even teleport more than a hundred feet! Ressa is by her side, and she’s—fighting?</p>
<p>It’s all a blur of motion in the darkness below. I see countless flickers of movement, and see flashes of light. The [Assassins] are going after Magnolia and Ressa with everything they have. Ressa is a blur around Magnolia, deflecting missiles, clashing with the [Assassins]—but there are too many. The only thing keeping both her and Magnolia alive is the bright aura around them that’s shielding them from harm.</p>
<p>But it’s growing weaker. I can see the glow fading, especially now that it’s the only contrast against the darkness outside. Each time a throwing star strikes Ressa’s shield it dims, and the [Assassins] are too smart to go hand-to-hand with Ressa. She catches one of them and kills him by striking his face—when she pulls her hand back half his head is gone. But the others just jump away and keep hurling weapons at her.</p>
<p>I stare down at the courtyard full of blurring shapes in shock. There’s a damn <em>war</em> going on down there! What do I do? I can’t just jump in—I doubt I’d even last a minute. And my potions and alchemist tricks aren’t going to work here.</p>
<p>But if I don’t, Magnolia will die. Right?</p>
<p>She has to be doing something. I see Magnolia’s hands moving in the courtyard, although I can’t tell if she’s holding anything amidst the fast movement. But she seems to be working on something—she doesn’t even look up as an [Assassin] closes on her and Ressa forces the killer back just in time.</p>
<p>What is she doing? Now she looks up. At what? A cloud?</p>
<p>The cloud? That wandering cloud from her garden? It’s right overhead. I stare at it. It’s roughly in the same place as when it rained at me. Magnolia looks up at it. But then her head turns.</p>
<p>Someone is striding across the courtyard, glowing with golden and sapphire light. Nemor’s entire body is wreathed in some kind of fantastic magical shield—it looks like water, filled with gold dust. He doesn’t even seem to notice as Ressa hurls two throwing stars at him—they sink into the barrier around him and disappear, as if they’ve fallen into a sea.</p>
<p>He points at Magnolia as he strides towards her. The [Assassins] charge with him, but Magnolia’s face is cool. She looks back up at the storm cloud and seems to sigh. I see something bright spark amidst the darkness of the cloud overhead.</p>
<p>“Reinhart! You will—”</p>
<p>Lightning strikes Nemor right in the chest. I see the world light up and go blind. I jerk backwards as I hear the <em>thwoom</em> of the sound and feel the impact a moment later. The sound is deafening, and the image of the coruscating bolt of electricity is burned into my retinas.</p>
<p>“Holy—”</p>
<p>The rest of my exclamation is drowned out by more flashes, and more thunder. I raise my head and peer over the edge to see lightning bolts shooting out of the rain cloud. And not just one or two.</p>
<p>A crackling storm of lightning blasts the earth around Magnolia and Ressa. They stand perfectly still as the cloud over their head turns from an innocent rain cloud into a flashing avatar of destruction. I see shapes fleeing from Magnolia in every direction, but the lightning is <em>alive.</em> It flashes down and curves towards the retreating [Assassins], blasting them to bits as they try to run.</p>
<p>In seconds, it’s over. All that remains are smouldering corpses, or pieces of them. I stare down at the courtyard as my vision slowly clears, spotting broken stone, scorched spots—and death.</p>
<p>They’re all dead. All, but two.</p>
<p>Nemor slowly stands back up, his magical shield crackling as the last burst of electricity earths itself around him. One of the [Assassins] who took cover behind the mage gets up as well. The shrouded figure—denuded now of it’s shadowy concealment—looks at Magnolia and Ressa. Without a word, it flees back towards the mansion.</p>
<p>“Coward! Come back!”</p>
<p>The mage shouts after the retreating [Assassin], but the figure pays no heed. I can’t blame them, either. After what I just saw, I’d run or surrender rather than fight the <em>sky.</em></p>
<p>But Nemor stands in front of Magnolia, no longer gloating but not fleeing either. Magic – a kaleidoscope of colors – swirls around his hands as he points at her.</p>
<p>“Your defenses might have killed the fodder sent to assist me. But I did not come here to fail, Reinhart!”</p>
<p>“Oh really? And who else do you have to die with you? More [Assassins]? I do believe I’ve cooked all of them, but I’ll happily do it to a few dozen more.”</p>
<p>I can hear Lady Magnolia’s voice, light and poised, from my position on the second floor. Nemor’s voice is filled with rage, but also confidence.</p>
<p>“Not just [Assassins], fool! Behold! Even your own tools are turned against you!”</p>
<p>He turns and points. I see movement in the darkness. The glint of light off of metal. Out of the darkness, ten Golems, the massive suits of plate armor armed with two-handed greatswords emerge. They take up positions behind Nemor as he laughs wildly.</p>
<p>“See how all is turned against you? The Circle of Thorns has roots in every place, even in your own home!”</p>
<p>“I see. Lightning wouldn’t work so well against them, would it?”</p>
<p>Magnolia sighs as she stares down at the Golems. I see Ressa take a blade out of her skirt, but Magnolia stops her with a hand on one arm.</p>
<p>“You know, those were a present for my sixteenth birthday. I’ll have to get rid of them now; once compromised there’s no trusting them. Couldn’t you have found some other target instead?”</p>
<p>“You seem to think you’ll still survive.”</p>
<p>Nemor sneers up at Magnolia. He raises a hand, and something bright flashes into being. I see a…blue fireball appear in the mage’s hands. It’s blue around the edges, and in the center I see a white-hot flame swirling.</p>
<p>“Your precious shield spell is nearly exhausted. Will it withstand my magic, and the Golems for more than a few seconds?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t have to. Once you’re dead the Golems will stop attacking as well. It’s very simple, Nemor.”</p>
<p>Magnolia lightly retorts. I see her raise her hands. She’s putting something on her index finger. I can’t see clearly what it is from this far away. Another ring?</p>
<p>Nemor doesn’t give Magnolia a chance to use it. He hurls the blue fireball, and the explosion engulfs the two women. I feel the blast from here—the air blows my hair and makes me cover my eyes. When I dare look again, I see Magnolia and Ressa, standing in the same spot.</p>
<p>What happened? Their shield must have absorbed the spell again. But it’s gone now, and Nemor has two more fireballs in each hand. He’s laughing.</p>
<p>“Well? Will you grovel now?”</p>
<p>“I still don’t see why I should.”</p>
<p>Magnolia’s tone cuts Nemor off. He snarls—and she continues, speaking over him.</p>
<p>“A powerful, if idiotic mage strong enough to bypass my wards, a group of [Assassins] to take down my mage, subverted control spells for my Golems—they even made sure to choose someone I trusted enough to let into my estate. This Circle really did manage to subvert all my outer defenses. For a first attempt, it was quite well done.”</p>
<p>“There won’t be a second time!”</p>
<p>Nemor roars in fury. He hurls another fireball at Magnolia, but this time Ressa moves. She draws something out of her skirt—a mirror?—and holds it up. The fireball is sucked into it. Nemor shouts.</p>
<p>“That cheap trick won’t work more than once!”</p>
<p>He points and the Golems lumber forward. But Ressa runs at them, hurling something onto the ground. Vines sprout up—a tripvine bag? Something like that, but these vines are huge, easily engulfing even the massive Golems and walling off the rest.</p>
<p>“You can’t protect yourself forever!”</p>
<p>The mage’s hands glow and he burns half the vines away in an instant with blue flame. He actually <em>melts</em> one of the Golems with his spell, but he doesn’t seem to care. He tries to catch Ressa, but she dodges backwards to Magnolia’s side.</p>
<p>“Your [Maid] can’t save you, Reinhart! She can’t breach my magics!”</p>
<p>“She doesn’t have to. Nemor, you are a fool.”</p>
<p>Magnolia’s finger glints with crimson light as she points at the mage. A thin line of light shoots from the ring she wears and spears the mage through the chest. My breath catches—but the light doesn’t seem to do anything. And yet—it goes straight through Nemor’s shield and out the back of his body. What is it?</p>
<p>Lady Magnolia’s voice is light and calm. I hear her in the sudden silence.</p>
<p>“If you had begged—no, even if you had, it is far too late. This is the price you pay for overconfidence, Nemor. And betrayal.”</p>
<p>The Great Mage Nemor pauses. For a second I think he didn’t even see the line of red light, so thin is it. But then he spots it and goes still.</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>He stares down at the thin red line pulsing in his chest. When he looks up at Lady Magnolia all his confidence is gone.</p>
<p>“Please. Have m—”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>That’s the only word I hear. What I see is the burning line suddenly expanding. The thin line becomes a beam of burning air—a pillar—Nemor’s form is engulfed in a column of fire and then it <em>flashes—</em></p>
<p>This time the impact knocks me backwards. I hear more masonry falling around me and instinctively curl up into a ball. Miraculously, Magnolia’s mansion doesn’t fall to bits around me.</p>
<p>My head is spinning. I’m still blind. I slowly uncurl, and gasp, remembering to breathe.</p>
<p>What? What was—</p>
<p>Was that a railgun? No—it was similar, but whatever that burning line was expanded. Some kind of explosion.</p>
<p>I raise my head up, although I really want to keep it down. What I see when I dare look back in the courtyard is simple: I see burning ground, the dark night, fallen bodies.</p>
<p>And Lady Magnolia, standing in the center of the courtyard, still pointing, her finger aimed straight at her enemy’s chest.</p>
<p>And where Nemor once stood? Nothing. A crater of black, smoking ash is all that remains. He is dead, and the Golems stand lifeless, some still tangled in the vines.</p>
<p>It’s over.</p>
<p>For a while, I just lie there, staring down at the courtyard. Lady Magnolia and Ressa look like they’re talking. My eyes are drawn to them—and then the devastation.</p>
<p>Gods. How many people just died down there? A bunch of [Assassins]—even if they weren’t ‘masters’, they had to be high-level. And that Nemor—what level was he?</p>
<p>I don’t know. I can’t even guess. I just witnessed a conflict that I’m far too inexperienced to even guess the magnitude of. It leaves me shaking.</p>
<p>Eventually, though, I stand up. I have to do—something. I wander back towards where the door used to be. I stare down the empty hallway, and then, finally, hear the other sounds.</p>
<p>Sound. It’s such an odd thing. As I lay watching the battle, I could only hear the clash of metal, Nemor’s voice, and the roar and boom of the magical spells. But now I hear other sounds.</p>
<p>Distant shouting. Crying. The voices of people. Who?</p>
<p>[Maids]. [Manservants]. The staff of the house, that’s who. As I slowly walk back into the non-destroyed parts of Magnolia’s estate, I suddenly remember them. And I see them, rushing about, tending to the wounded.</p>
<p>The wounded? Yes—the [Assassins] and Nemor didn’t just attack Magnolia. They struck the servants in her home first. I pass by multiple still bodies, stabbed or burnt practically to ash. But the few casualties of those unfortunate enough to get in the way are nothing compared to the wounded.</p>
<p>Several [Maids] are desperately trying to keep a man lying on the ground alive. He’s stabbed in the stomach—multiple times by the looks of it. But there are three shapes on the ground, all dressed in black clothing.</p>
<p>Assassins? They’re all dead. The servants must have fought them off. The maids look up at me and I—</p>
<p>Stab wound. They took the blade out, which is bad. The bleeding is severe. I grab the nearest cloth I can find—a dead [Maid]’s dress—and press it against the man’s stomach as hard as I can. I ignore his cries and get the other [Maids] to help.</p>
<p>I keep the dressing there, trying to stop blood from flowing, keep the man alive. Somehow, he holds on long enough for one of the [Maids] to dash back with a potion. She pours it on the wound and it heals instantly. The man sits up, gasping.</p>
<p>He lives.</p>
<p>I stand up and go. My hands are covered with blood, but I pay no attention. I feel like a dreamer, walking through Magnolia’s grand home, now filled with death and destruction.</p>
<p>I give aid one more time, helping bind a tourniquet until a potion can arrive, and then I find the last [Assassin]. The one who ran.</p>
<p>He lies on the ground, a hole in his chest, black clothing still smoking from where something burned away part of his leg. Two people are standing over him, a [Butler] and a [Maid].</p>
<p>I blink at Reynold. He and the maid both hold weapons in their hands. A shortsword and buckler in his hands, and a glowing wand in the [Maid]’s. They stare at me, first wary, then relaxing.</p>
<p>“Miss Ryoka. Are you unharmed?”</p>
<p>“Mm?”</p>
<p>I stare down at the [Assassin]. Filled by some unshakeable curiosity, I pull back his hood. I see not a man’s face as I’d assumed from his build, but a Gnoll’s. Dead.</p>
<p>“Miss Ryoka?”</p>
<p>I look back up at Reynold. He looks concerned for me. He moves his hand and I flinch, but he touches my head gently. He shows me…blood. On his fingertips.</p>
<p>“You’re hurt. I have a healing potion—please, hold still.”</p>
<p>I let him pour a bit on my temple. The pounding in my head stops. Huh. I didn’t even realize my head was throbbing until this moment. And I feel—a bit more steady.</p>
<p>I stare back down at the [Assassin]. Then I look back at Reynold. He looks grim, but he’s dealing with the situation better than I am at the moment. I hesitate, and then point at the dead Gnoll, grinning stupidly.</p>
<p>“Does this happen often as well?”</p>
<p>He just stares at me.</p>
<p>“Not in my lifetime. But I have heard stories of attempts made on one of the Five Families’ before.”</p>
<p>“Oh? And what comes next, then? What will Magnolia do?”</p>
<p>He looks at me as if it were obvious.</p>
<p>“She will go to war.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem with winning, Lady Magnolia reflected, was that the winner inevitably had to clean up. Oh, of course some fools might choose to let the dead lie where they were, but that was only an option on the battlefield, and in her experience, most battles took place outside of battlefields.</p>
<p>She stood in what remained of her lovely courtyard, sighing and staring at the dead bodies as Ressa barked orders by her side. Magnolia knew better than to interrupt—Ressa’s control over her staff didn’t have any room for her, so while Ressa coordinated her people, Magnolia chattered. She often did that in times of stress; and every other time as well. She didn’t like silence.</p>
<p>“Not a shred of warning. Not a <em>hint.</em> What good are all my informants and spies if they can’t warn me of an impending attack?”</p>
<p>“I believe that is why it is known as a ‘sneak’ attack.”</p>
<p>Her [Head Maid] paused in the act of ordering a group of servants to race through the mansion to distribute healing potions. Naturally, Magnolia’s estate had many potions and artifacts for emergencies, but it was one thing to be prepared and another to be ready for an actual attack. Magnolia’s heart ached as reports came in of the servants who had gotten in the way of the assassins and Nemor during the attack.</p>
<p>Something would have to be done. They would have to train the staff, not just those experienced in combat—especially if this was a forecast of things to come.</p>
<p>“Even so, the fact that not one person reported anything unusual happening is telling, isn’t it, Ressa? Our spies are compromised.”</p>
<p>Ressa nodded briefly. That much was as obvious to both women as the moon.</p>
<p>“Some will have been caught off-guard. Others were bribed or threatened. More were traitors to begin with. It will take a great deal of work discovering which is which.”</p>
<p>“However, if this <em>is</em> the Circle of Thorns and not some pretenders…this is very serious, Ressa.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>More people rushed up to the two women. Magnolia listened with one ear while she thought quietly. She stopped one maid, though.</p>
<p>“What was that about an [Assassin]? Was the last one found?”</p>
<p>Ressa nodded.</p>
<p>“Reynold and Sacra caught the last one as he was trying to flee. He is dead.”</p>
<p>“Dead?”</p>
<p>Magnolia’s tone was irate. She glared at Ressa, ignoring the [Maid] who fled from her presence.</p>
<p>“Couldn’t you have captured that one alive? I want at least one witness to interrogate. What good are dead bodies to me? I don’t know any [Necromancers]—at least, none that I trust!”</p>
<p>She knew she was being petty, but she was in a bad mood. Ressa clicked her tongue disapprovingly as she responded to her mistress.</p>
<p>“That would have been an unnecessary risk. These killers had unknown Skills and magical items. Killing the escaping one quickly was the correct decision for Reynold and Sacra to make and I stand by their decision.”</p>
<p>“You would.”</p>
<p>Magnolia grumbled, but she let the matter drop. She knew it would have probably been pointless anyways—[Assassins] were notorious for dying to protect their client’s secrets. She paused as she heard a voice in her head.</p>
<p><em>“Magnolia!”</em></p>
<p>“Oh, Ressa. I hear Teriarch. I’ll have to talk with him.”</p>
<p>Ressa nodded, and stepped away as Magnolia began to speak into the air.</p>
<p>“I’m here, Teriarch.”</p>
<p>The old Dragon’s voice was urgent in her mind.</p>
<p><em>“Magnolia! I received your signal. Are you—?”</em></p>
<p>“Fine. There was an attack. Assassins and a mage came to kill me.”</p>
<p><em>“Assassins? Are you sure you’re safe?”</em></p>
<p>“I’m fine, old fool.”</p>
<p>Magnolia’s tone was acerbic, but she relented a bit when she heard the genuine concern in Teriarch’s ‘voice’. She could almost picture the Dragon anxiously fanning his wings.</p>
<p><em>“If you think they might be around, I could be there in minutes. A spell or—I could fly!”</em></p>
<p>“You? Fly all the way here?”</p>
<p>The woman snorted, amused by the idea.</p>
<p>“If you want to come I’d welcome you. But Ressa tells me the place is secure, and she would know. I have my own [Mages] and artifacts who will be able to safeguard me, you know that.”</p>
<p>There was a pause as Teriarch considered Magnolia’s reply.</p>
<p><em>“If Ressa says so…tell me what happened!”</em></p>
<p>Briefly, Magnolia related the events to Teriarch.</p>
<p>“Will you come or not? I could use you here.”</p>
<p>She held her breath, but not much. Teriarch’s reply was everything she expected.</p>
<p><em>“Well…if you’re safe, then I hardly need to go out. Other mages can take care of the rest—but you should get rid of the Golems.”</em></p>
<p>“I know. But it’s such a waste. I got those for my birthday, you know.”</p>
<p><em>“Nevertheless. If one mage can seize control of them, they cannot be trusted. You need a better Golem anyways—how often have I told you not to rely on these shoddy animated suits of armor?”</em></p>
<p>“Oh? And what would you propose?”</p>
<p>Magnolia snapped at the empty air. Teriarch’s voice was arch as he replied.</p>
<p><em>“Any superior construct would do. A Gemstone Golem would have far more utility as you well know. Ivory Golems are too susceptible to interference via death magic of course, but if you would just buy a Magestone Golem—or even a Truestone Golem—”</em></p>
<p>“Not even you have a Truestone Construct lying around. And besides, I’m fairly certain those were outlawed in several nations.”</p>
<p><em>“Hmf. Wistram has one.”</em></p>
<p>“And she is not for sale. Believe me, I’ve asked and she is definite on that subject. Teriarch, I have work to do. If you aren’t coming—”</p>
<p><em>“Very well. I will contact you later. But if you need help—”</em></p>
<p>Magnolia’s voice was soft.</p>
<p>“I know. I will ask. But there’s only so much you can do in that cave.”</p>
<p>She heard no reply. Instead, she sensed the magical connection break. Magnolia turned back to Ressa, and found the woman was waiting for her.</p>
<p>“All done?”</p>
<p>“Things are stable for now.”</p>
<p>“Good. Then find me Ryoka Griffin. I only saw the girl sensibly had her head down after Nemor blasted through the wall. Do you know where she is? Is she hurt?”</p>
<p>Ressa shook her head.</p>
<p>“She is alive and mostly unharmed. At the moment she is helping tend to the wounded.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Really.”</p>
<p>Magnolia paused.</p>
<p>“Good. There may be some hope for her after all. Take me to her.”</p>
<p>The two began to walk into the mansion. Magnolia sighed as she looked at the injured, but she kept talking to Ressa as they walked.</p>
<p>“It’s begun, Ressa. It’s war, you know that, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Against the Circle of Thorns?”</p>
<p>“Wherever and whoever they may be. I have an idea of where to start, but—”</p>
<p>“The same problem as before?”</p>
<p>“If my great grandmother’s diary is right, it will be a nightmare. Still, we can’t let them do this again. I think you know what we have to do.”</p>
<p>Ressa waited. Magnolia made a face as she forced herself to say the words out loud.</p>
<p>“I’ll need to gather my flight of attendants. My allies, anyone who can be trusted—do you know where all my attendants are right now?”</p>
<p>“Right where you left them. The Reinhart estate in First Landing.”</p>
<p>“Damn. I hate that place.”</p>
<p>“When should we leave?”</p>
<p>“Tonight. Have Reynold get the coach ready. We can be back soon, but we have to move <em>now.</em>”</p>
<p>“And Ryoka?”</p>
<p>“Well, for the moment…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An hour ago I was talking about the fate of the world with Magnolia. Now I’m standing in the rubble of her mansion, helping pour healing potions on the wounded.</p>
<p>In fairness, there’s not that much rubble and no longer as many wounded. The wards on the Reinhart estate are sturdy, and Nemor only destroyed one room. But the air still feels tense, electric with fear and anxiety.</p>
<p>And grief. I stand up from tending to what used to be one man’s leg and turn to find Lady Magnolia and Ressa. They stare down at the [Manservant] as he tries to get up and fails.</p>
<p>“Stay there.”</p>
<p>Ressa’s voice is calm and imperious. But she kneels and inspects the man’s stump of a leg with gentle hands. The wound is healed, but his leg is gone. Burnt away. He shudders, but doesn’t cry out like he was doing earlier. He only looks up at Ressa and Lady Magnolia.</p>
<p>“I regret—I’m afraid I won’t be able to wait tables any longer, Miss Ressa.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that. Just rest.”</p>
<p>Ressa lies the man back and more servants come to lift him in a stretcher. I watch them take the man away, and see Ressa’s gaze follow him.</p>
<p>She does care about the other servants. She might act like a general from hell ordering them about, but she cares.</p>
<p>And Magnolia—</p>
<p>I glance at the other woman. Lady Magnolia Reinhart is standing in the corridor, coolly surveying the devastation. People rush around her, and occasionally she’ll direct someone, but for the most part she just lets Ressa work.</p>
<p>She’s not down there tending to people herself. But she is radiating calm authority like a lighthouse. That’s a type of leadership, and I can see it reassuring the people around her. They look to her.</p>
<p>“Ryoka Griffin.”</p>
<p>Now her eyes find me, and I shudder. I can’t take comfort in her presence. Not after what I saw. I nod to her to cover my unease.</p>
<p>“I saw what happened.”</p>
<p>“Hm. Well, I am relieved to see you weren’t hurt. I was almost afraid you’d jump into the fight.”</p>
<p>No fear of that. I stare at the one-legged man as he disappears down the corridor.</p>
<p>“What will happen to him?”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“The man…with the missing leg. What will happen to him after this?”</p>
<p>Magnolia blinks at me, surprised by my question.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Will he lose his job? He sounded like he was a waiter.”</p>
<p>“Of course he won’t lose his job! I will find a new one for him that he can fulfill with one leg. That is all that will happen. Why, did you think I would fire him?”</p>
<p>I can only shrug. Magnolia scowls. She seems genuinely annoyed with me.</p>
<p>“No one injured in my employ will ever face losing their job. I do not abandon my people.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Good.”</p>
<p>I turn my back and stare at the people hurrying around me. I can tell Magnolia is eying me balefully from behind.</p>
<p>“I trust you understand this complicates matters.”</p>
<p>“I kind of got that when all the [Assassins] appeared. What was the mage talking about? Who are the Circle of Thorns?”</p>
<p>Magnolia pretends she didn’t hear my question.</p>
<p>“Sadly, I have suddenly become far too busy to hound you on the matter of inventions from your world. I will do so at a later date, but for now I believe I will have to let you go.”</p>
<p>I turn and meet her eyes.</p>
<p>“Do you think I’m an idiot? I know this isn’t over.”</p>
<p>She rolls hers.</p>
<p>“Of course it isn’t. But by all means, attend to your own business. We are allies, so I shall make sure you meet with the best experts in Invrisil. Tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Experts? What experts?”</p>
<p>Another eye roll. Magnolia points at my side, at the bag of holding I’m carrying and snaps.</p>
<p>“<em>Magical</em> experts, idiot! I know your adventurer friends uncovered some relics. Well, I will have some meet with you. And then, when I am done attending to this—you and I will talk again.”</p>
<p>“Great.”</p>
<p>Magnolia raises an eyebrow, but that’s all I have to say on the matter. She sighs, loudly.</p>
<p>“You are an obnoxious child sometimes, you know that? You remind me of Ressa when she was young.”</p>
<p>Ahead of her, Ressa turns and glares at Magnolia. I do the same. Magnolia waves her hand at the two of us.</p>
<p>“You will sleep here tonight. Ressa will find you a room.”</p>
<p>And so she does. I stay awake long enough to see the mansion slowly settle back into some kind of normalcy—and then I go to the large, extravagantly adorned room that has been allotted to me. I lie on the bed, but I’m still far too awake to sleep.</p>
<p>I can still see the lightning, still see the line of fire engulf Nemor. I don’t know what it means, and I’m almost afraid to find out. But one thing I do know.</p>
<p>The sky is already beginning to brighten. I try to sleep, willing myself to rest for however long I can. I think I’ll need the energy. I’m not done here. Not by far.</p>
<p>Invrisil, the City of Adventurers, awaits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 45</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot can happen in a day. I mean, that’s a fairly obvious statement, but I find myself surprised, sometimes, at how much can happen.</p>
<p>Forty-five days. That’s how long I’ve been in this world. But although I had a lot of amazing, unforgettable experiences in these forty-five days, the last few have seen the most happen.</p>
<p>Especially three days ago. Three days ago I survived my first avalanche. I coordinated a rescue effort; I touched a dead person, and saved a life. More than one for both counts, if I’m honest.</p>
<p>But I choose to remember the living. And I have to keep moving forwards rather than dwell on the past; a lot more rests on my shoulders, now.</p>
<p>It’s a bit…ironic. A few days ago Durene and I were effectively outcasts living on the edge of Riverfarm, barely tolerated for who we were. Well, Durene was barely tolerated; I was more popular. But we were both shunned for our relationship.</p>
<p>And now? Now our little cottage is our hideaway from the rest of the world. At least if we stay there we can sleep in peace.</p>
<p>In three days, I went from being a blind man with an unhealthy obsession with half-Trolls in the eyes of the village to being an [Emperor]. Of course, I was always an [Emperor], but they didn’t know that.</p>
<p>They do now. True, I didn’t exactly advertise the fact, but everyone heard me when I first took control of the village. And word spreads fast.</p>
<p>How would you react to having an Emperor in your village? I’d imagine normally there would be a lot of questions and maybe even suspicion or hostility.</p>
<p>But in this case? There’s none. The villagers saw me running from spot to spot, finding people trapped in the snow. That earns you a lot of trust, not to mention gratitude. I am an [Emperor], and the villagers treat me as such.</p>
<p>Which brings me on to the downside of my current living situation: I’m an [Emperor]. And Riverfarm is now technically under my dominion.</p>
<p>Which, defacto, makes me their ruler. Which also makes me responsible for them. And makes them subservient to me.</p>
<p>And boy, do they take that role seriously.</p>
<p>“Are they still outside, Durene?”</p>
<p>I hear her rustle as she sits up and looks at the window.</p>
<p>“I think Gamel’s still out there.”</p>
<p>“Still?”</p>
<p>Or should I say, ‘already’? I frown as I sit up in bed next to Durene. It’s barely past dawn, and there’s someone out there?</p>
<p>“Did he camp out here?”</p>
<p>“I think so. He’s got a fire and everything.”</p>
<p>“We should have invited him in. Not that there’s space, but…”</p>
<p>I mutter to myself as I put on pants and a shirt and coat. I try to stay low; one of the downsides to being blind is that you can’t really tell where windows are or if doors are open. It means I’m somewhat paranoid about flashing someone by mistake.</p>
<p>“Why is he even out there? I told them I’d be back as soon as I woke up today.”</p>
<p>“I think they wanted to have someone here in case you needed anything.”</p>
<p>Durene answers cautiously as she readies some tea and rekindles the fire. She knows how I feel about suddenly being the ruler of Riverfarm, but I can tell from her voice that she’s pleased.</p>
<p>And can I blame her? She used to be the village laborer, the barely-tolerated half-monster girl. And now she’s the consort of an [Emperor], or my personal servant, or whatever. The point is that even though our relationship isn’t a secret, no one’s throwing rocks at Durene, and everyone treats her with almost as much deference as they treat me.</p>
<p>Part of that might also be her class. Durene is a Level 6 [Paladin] now. She gained the levels from helping save people and working to help the village. True, she didn’t slay monsters, but her doing good deeds fits with the idea of a [Paladin] in modern culture. And for her efforts, she gained not one, but two Skills.</p>
<p>[Weapon Proficiency: Shield] and [Graceful Step]. Now, the first Skill makes sense to me. It sounds like a classic feat out of any fantasy roleplaying game, but [Graceful Step]? Apparently, it allows Durene to move, well, gracefully. If I put it bluntly, she no longer sounds like an earthquake when she moves around her cottage, and she can even sneak up on me now!</p>
<p>It’s quite incredible to me, but it’s also odd. I mean, why would moving silently, or rather, gracefully, be that important to a [Paladin]? Is it because the class is taking from the original idea of a paladin being a member of Charlemagne’s court and being considered dignified characters? Or is it more broadly taken from the fact that paladins are supposed to be champions of justice, respected characters in the eyes of the many?</p>
<p>Perhaps there’s another set of guidelines I don’t know about entirely. All I do know is that Durene—</p>
<p><em>Squark.</em></p>
<p>I wince and hear Durene’s surprised exclamation.</p>
<p>“Oh good. Frostwing’s awake.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the noisy eaglet has awoken, and upon finding both Durene and I are awake, is stridently, nay, angrily <em>demanding </em>we feed her breakfast. I scowl as I find the bowl of half-frozen food by the kitchen counter and shove it at the bird.</p>
<p>“Eat, you ungrateful fowl. Stop complaining—I haven’t even had breakfast yet!”</p>
<p>Happily, Frostwing does just that. She’s gotten even bigger than she was three days ago, and now she can peck at the food herself. I can even feel a few feathers coming in, although I’ve been too preoccupied with the village to attend to her as much as I’d like.</p>
<p>Speaking of which—</p>
<p>As Durene puts some butter in the pan and I delight at hearing it sizzle, I open the door and walk out to Gamel. I know the young man—he’s been following me and Durene around since the day of the avalanche. And I can even ‘see’ him in my mind—he’s camped right at the boundary of where Durene’s cottage ends.</p>
<p>“Emperor Laken, sir!”</p>
<p>I hear his excited voice as I crunch through the snow. I make a face and stop before I’m too close to him.</p>
<p>“I told you, Mister Laken is fine.”</p>
<p>I’d prefer to do away with even that, to be honest. But the villagers insist on calling me something. And that’s way better than ‘Emperor’.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Mister Laken.”</p>
<p>He sounds <em>chastened.</em> I sigh.</p>
<p>“Never mind that. Durene and I were about to have breakfast. Can I invite you in?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t do that!”</p>
<p>He sounds horrified. I sigh again, but I knew Gamel would probably say that.</p>
<p>“You’re sure?”</p>
<p>“Yes sir. I’ve got some porridge and even some smoked bacon right here, sir. A feast!”</p>
<p>“Well, in that case we’ll be out soon. If you’re cold, the door’s open.”</p>
<p>“I won’t be cold. I will be waiting, sir!”</p>
<p>I shake my head to myself as I walk back to the cottage. How did it come to this?</p>
<p>I brighten up a bit when I push open the door and smell meat cooking. Durene’s poking at the pan, and I can tell there are some thick slabs of ham waiting to be eaten.</p>
<p>“Smells good.”</p>
<p>“It does, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>Durene sounds just as excited as I am as she flips the dripping slices onto a plate. She and I eat at a table—me ignoring Frostwing’s chirps as she tries to get me to feed her.</p>
<p>“You’re disgusting, you know that?”</p>
<p>“<em>Me?</em>”</p>
<p>“Not you, silly. Frostwing. Didn’t you just eat the entire bowl?”</p>
<p>“I dunno Laken, she looks hungry. She’s getting bigger—what if we gave her some?”</p>
<p>“Maybe later. There’s such a thing as overfeeding her, Durene.”</p>
<p>“Oh, right.”</p>
<p>“…You can feed her that one bit.”</p>
<p>“Okay!”</p>
<p>I smile to myself as Frostwing shrieks in delight and then begs for more. Who knew a bird could beg? But then my smile falters a bit as I bite into my own bit of fried ham. Yes, it’s delicious. But the mere fact that Durene and I are feasting on ham for breakfast is a concern.</p>
<p>We’re eating meat. And that might be normal in my world, but in Durene’s, or at least, in her village, that’s a luxury. And it’s happening because all the animals in Riverfarm are dead.</p>
<p>They were all buried in the avalanche, and unlike the people, we didn’t get to them in time. Chickens, pigs, cows—even if you ignore the people that died, this was a disaster in its own right. These animals are what Riverfarm depends on for food and coin, and they were all killed at once.</p>
<p>The one small mercy was that at least their bodies were frozen. It means that the villagers and Durene and I can eat the animals one by one and stretch out our food stocks that way. But still. This would cripple any village and make it that much harder to survive the winter in the best of times.</p>
<p>And after the avalanche, Riverfarm is certainly not going through the best of times. That’s why despite our big and delicious meal, Durene and I are out of the cottage in the next fifteen minutes, and we walk with Gamel trailing in our wake to Riverfarm in good time.</p>
<p>“Mister Laken!”</p>
<p>“Emperor Laken!”</p>
<p>“Emperor!”</p>
<p>“Sire!”</p>
<p>Countless voices greet me as I walk into the village. I smile and wave, and greet people by name. I’m used to the attention by now, at least enough so that I don’t get slowed down and get to the village center in good time. When I’m there, I immediately cast around the village with my [Emperor] senses.</p>
<p>Let’s see. What’s changed since yesterday? Some new houses are excavated—good. Nothing’s collapsed today, which is a relief. The dead animals—</p>
<p>—Are still frozen in the ground. But one of them looks…gnawed at? I frown.</p>
<p>“Mister Prost?”</p>
<p>With my senses I can tell the man jumps as I address him directly among the crowd. People still can’t quite believe I can sense things without seeing. But he hurries forwards as I call him.</p>
<p>“Yes, Mister Laken?”</p>
<p>“One of the dead cows—the one buried just past the barn—looks like it’s been partially eaten. Have animals found the body?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I’ll have someone check at once!”</p>
<p>Prost’s voice is filled with consternation and I hear him hurry off. In minutes he’s back with news.</p>
<p>“Animals did eat at the body, sir! Looks like foxes or something similar. They ate a good bit.”</p>
<p>“That’s not good.”</p>
<p>I sigh as I hear people around me mutter. Well, I suspected this would happen.</p>
<p>“Looks like wildlife is returning to the area after the avalanche. We’ll need to make sure they don’t get at any more of the dead animals before we can properly smoke them, salt them, or preserve them some other way.”</p>
<p>“That will be hard, sir.”</p>
<p>Prost sounds worried. I nod, but try to look for a better angle. There has to be something…</p>
<p>“What if we set traps for the foragers? We could catch a few animals—maybe more food for the pot?”</p>
<p>“That could work!”</p>
<p>The man brightens up and I hear voices sounding approving around me. Jeez. As if that was some brilliant idea. Any one of them could have come up with it—they’d probably be able to execute it far better than I could since they actually know how all of this works. But they let me do the thinking and deciding, because I am an [Emperor] after all, and don’t I know best?</p>
<p>This is how my day goes now. I coordinate with Prost about getting people to set traps up as Durene goes to help dig. She’s been doing it every day—we’ve nearly gotten all of the houses excavated, but there’s still tons of snow around the village that could be cleared out. And the fields—</p>
<p>“At the very least, we should focus on finding a place to store the dead animals. The barn perhaps. If we could close the doors and put the frozen bodies in the snow there, that might keep a lot of hungry animals at bay.”</p>
<p>“We can do that. Just give the word, Mister Laken.”</p>
<p>“I’m just worried larger predators will smell the dead bodies and come searching.”</p>
<p>“Aye, that’s true. The Emperor has a point. What if a bear scents out the carcasses?”</p>
<p>I hear a murmur of worry.</p>
<p>We’ll have to have eyes on the barn, then. But we can’t just let the bodies rot and keeping them buried is just asking for trouble. Let’s get to it.</p>
<p>Prost takes command of a few villagers, and I choose more people who either volunteer or who I know have good Skills for the job. No one complains. Everyone’s so full of this—this can-do attitude it almost makes my heart hurt.</p>
<p>Here they are, days after an avalanche that killed their family and friends, and they’re putting their lives back together. Without a word of complaint. Helping one another, sharing all they have. All they needed was a little nudge to do it.</p>
<p>“But it isn’t good enough.”</p>
<p>I mutter the words quietly as I sit in Prosts’s house, repurposed to act as a central hub I can work in.</p>
<p>“What’s that, sir?”</p>
<p>I shake my head at Gamel as he leans forwards to pay closer attention. It’s nothing.</p>
<p><em>Liar.</em> I know what the problem is, and I know I have to address it soon. Today. The villagers are working hard, I know that. They’ve excavated their village, repaired damage, worked together, buried the dead. They’ve performed a small miracle, but—</p>
<p>“But we don’t have enough food to last the winter. Nor are we ready for a monster attack.”</p>
<p>That’s the situation I lay out in front of Prost and the other older villagers later that day. I hear them talking amongst themselves, but they go quiet when I continue.</p>
<p>“We’ve got stores of food of course—plenty, in fact. And the harsh truth of it is that we’re benefited by having fewer mouths to feed. But—even so. We lost all the animals, and a number of cellars where the snow and ice smashed everything to bits. And there are other villages that were hit too—what if relatives come? People seeking aid, who weren’t as fortunate as us? What if there are more mouths to feed? And while we’re struggling to make ends meet, monsters could attack us at any time.”</p>
<p>I’ve never encountered a monster, but Durene and the others have told me stories, and they’re horrific. Monsters, especially smart ones like Goblins, love to attack when people are at their weakest. I’m sure Riverfarm is a lovely target for them, and the other villagers know I’m right.</p>
<p>“What should we do then, Mister Laken? Do you have a plan?”</p>
<p>That’s Prost’s voice again. He seems to speak for a lot of the villagers. I nod at him, trying to project confidence so he won’t be worried. Odd. A few days ago he was trying to tell me what to do. Now—</p>
<p>“I do. If we don’t have enough food here, and we need help, we might as well just buy it.”</p>
<p>“Buy it? You mean—from a city?”</p>
<p>Consternation fills the room. I wait for them to quiet, and then ask for opinions. Again, Prost is first up to bat.</p>
<p>“Pardon me, Mister Laken, but I’m afraid our village doesn’t have the coin to buy enough food—let alone hire adventurers to guard us. We never did. We could buy enough food for a few weeks maybe, or hire a few bronze-rank adventurers for the same amount of time if we pool our coin, but…”</p>
<p>He trails off helplessly. The other villagers mutter their agreement. It’s so—interesting. None of them want to tell me I’m wrong, even when they are telling me just that. It’s like they want to be proven wrong, to know I’ve always got something up my sleeve.</p>
<p>That’s unhealthy. I need to get them to stop thinking like that. Even if…they’re right in this case.</p>
<p>I clear my throat.</p>
<p>“Money will not be an issue, ladies and gentlemen. I happen to have quite enough coin to pay for whatever Riverfarm needs.”</p>
<p>“You do?”</p>
<p>I nod at Mister Prost.</p>
<p>“Remember the gold coin I traded you, Mister Prost? I have hundreds more like it.”</p>
<p>Is it risky telling a bunch of desperate villagers I’m rich? Maybe. And some would say that’s especially true since I’m blind. But I have a good read on these people. They’re honest, hardworking, loyal—even if they are a bit racist. And they look up to me.</p>
<p>My faith in them is not misplaced. If anything, I underestimate their spirit. After the shocked exclamations die down, one of the other villagers, a woman named Teriane, speaks up.</p>
<p>“Mister Laken, we can’t hardly have you paying for all of us! We’d never be able to repay you!”</p>
<p>The others mutter sadly in agreement. I just shake my head.</p>
<p>“Nonsense. No one needs to pay me back anything. I’m your [Emperor], so it’s only natural that I’d take care of my citizens.”</p>
<p>Also, I got the money practically for free. But when the villagers hear this, they’re moved to tears. Literally, in some cases. I feel bad—but I feel worse when they begin to cheer.</p>
<p>“Emperor Laken!”</p>
<p>“Long live Emperor Laken!”</p>
<p>“Emperor!”</p>
<p>Oh god. This is too much for me. Eventually I get them all to sit down and shut up, and I keep going with my plan.</p>
<p>“Okay, money isn’t an issue, but what <em>is</em> important is getting to a proper place to spend all of what I have. To that end…I’m going to Invrisil.”</p>
<p>“<em>What?</em>”</p>
<p>“It’s the only way!”</p>
<p>I talk over their exclamations. I explain as best I can.</p>
<p>“I’ll take Durene—and Frostwing too, I suppose. The three of us can move quickly, and go to the Adventurer’s Guild and marketplace to buy all we need.”</p>
<p>“But sir—you can’t! It’s too dangerous for you and—and especially Durene!”</p>
<p>Prost is the first to speak up. I can tell he’s agitated, and I understand why.</p>
<p>Durene. She’s always wanted to go to a city, and always been too scared of what treatment she might receive. But this—</p>
<p>“Durene is the only person who can guide me properly. I trust her, and she’s strong.”</p>
<p>“Then why not let one of us go instead?”</p>
<p>“Do you really think you’d be safe, Mister Prost? Even if I sent ten people—what if you were attacked by bandits? Or if someone tried to mug you for the gold?”</p>
<p>They can’t reply to that. I nod seriously.</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking this over. Durene might stand out, but she’s stronger than any thug, and I…I’m an [Emperor]. We’d stand more of a chance, and besides, who would try robbing a blind man and a half-Troll?”</p>
<p>Well, more people would try to rob me than Durene. But the villagers still don’t like the idea.</p>
<p>“What will happen when you’re gone, though? Emperor, sir, we need you!”</p>
<p>“You don’t need me.”</p>
<p>I scowl as I override their objections.</p>
<p>“No, be quiet! You don’t need me. You did perfectly well when I wasn’t here, and I’ll only be gone a few days at the most. And when I return, I’ll have everything we need.”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>I can hear part of their fear unspoken in their voices. It’s not just the dangers they worry about. It’s that I might abandon them. I mean, it’s not as if I didn’t think of it. What’s stopping me and Durene from just leaving Riverfarm to their fate?</p>
<p>My duty as an [Emperor], that’s what. And if not that, my soul.</p>
<p>“Mister Prost.”</p>
<p>I walk up to the man, and take him by the arm. He starts at my touch, but I look at him. My eyes are closed obviously, but this is as close as I can get to what it would be like if I could see.</p>
<p>“Mister Prost. I <em>will</em> come back. Riverfarm is my home, now. This is my empire. I will return. You have my word as an [Emperor] on it.”</p>
<p>I don’t know what Prost sees in my closed eyelids, but whatever I say, it works. In a moment he changes from arguing against me to arguing for me.</p>
<p>“Trust in Emperor Laken you lot! No—quiet Melpin! You don’t know what you’re talking about. If Emperor Laken say he’ll do it—he’ll do it!”</p>
<p>And that settles that. Oh, of course I had to reassure people and tell the others what was going to happen, but once I got the ball rolling, it couldn’t be stopped.</p>
<p>Not that there weren’t a few alterations, mind. In the end it was decided that we’d take a wagon. Durene would be able to pull me, Frostwing, and the gold and some travel supplies along. I objected of course, but Durene was the one who argued against me the most here.</p>
<p>“I can pull you all, Laken! Honest!”</p>
<p>Against my better judgment, I agreed to it, especially, as it turned out, because we’d be getting company. Gamel was chosen to accompany us—as a sort of helper to Durene and someone who could talk to guards and whatnot.</p>
<p>It made sense, and I couldn’t get the villagers to budge, so I let it all pass. That’s how we found ourselves getting ready long into the night, and I drew up some plans for the villagers to follow while we were gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 46</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>“The cart is loaded?”</p>
<p>“Yes sir!”</p>
<p>“Frostwing’s secure in her nest?”</p>
<p>I hear her shrill cry and nod.</p>
<p>“Durene? Are you sure about this?”</p>
<p>“Positive! Look, I can pull this so easily!”</p>
<p>Durene demonstrates and I wobbled and nearly lose my balance standing on the wagon.</p>
<p>“Oh! Sorry Laken!”</p>
<p>“Nevermind that. Okay, it’s time!”</p>
<p>I turn and wave to the villagers. They cheer and call out my name. Durene pulls the wagon, Gamel shouts and hollers back at his sweetheart, and we set out down the snow-covered road. The villagers worked all night to clear it so we can travel on, and the ride isn’t nearly as bumpy as I thought it would be.</p>
<p>I sit back down in the wagon and feel the comfy, warm blankets around me. The villagers really spared no expense giving me the luxury accommodations.</p>
<p>“Durene, just let me know when you get tired. If you can’t pull us all the way, I’m more than happy to get out and walk.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine, Laken! I could even pull Gamel!”</p>
<p>“That’s fine Durene. I like walking. I could—help pull if you need it.”</p>
<p>“No, I got it!”</p>
<p>We move onwards. I feel the fresh morning air in my face and sigh.</p>
<p>“This is so weird.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it exciting?”</p>
<p>Durene’s voice is filled with delight and apprehension in equal measures. I can just tell she’s twisting in place as she walks to stare up at me.</p>
<p>“I’m so nervous, Laken! We’re going to a city! Not just a city, <em>the city! </em>The City of Adventurers!”</p>
<p>“I’ve never been there myself. Is it amazing?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Both Durene and Gamel chorus at the same time. I grin.</p>
<p>“But neither of you have been there before, have you?”</p>
<p>Practically none of the villagers have. Invrisil is a huge city, and the people of Riverfarm trade with the local town rather than go all the way there. But the city is the dream of all young folk.</p>
<p>Including me, I guess.</p>
<p>“Laken?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Durene?”</p>
<p>I can hear the worry in her voice as she pauses before speaking.</p>
<p>“Do you really think it’ll be alright? I mean…for me?”</p>
<p>I take a while before I reply. That was my worry too. But…</p>
<p>“It’ll be okay.”</p>
<p>“You’re sure?”</p>
<p>“There might be some people who just look at you and judge you from first glance, but if there are, I’ll deal with them. I am an [Emperor], after all. And you are my lovely subject.”</p>
<p>“That makes me relieved. I mean, I’m just so nervous! We have a fortune in the wagon! What if someone finds out?”</p>
<p>Durene says it again, but I can tell she’s feeling better. I tease her as we go up a small slope that apparently leads out of the village.</p>
<p>“How will anyone find out? Unless you shout it to them, that is.”</p>
<p>“I’m just saying! There could be bandits, or monsters—”</p>
<p>“You’ll just have to defend me, then.”</p>
<p>“<em>Me!?</em>”</p>
<p>“Of course you! You’re my [Paladin], after all, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“I guess…”</p>
<p>“Oh come now. Don’t worry, Durene! What’s the worst that could go wrong?”</p>
<p>Frostwing squawks in my ear, and Durene giggles. I sit back as Gamel starts talking about being an adventurer and maybe even going to Wistram, and Durene excitedly asks him what magic he’d study, and turn my face up to the sky.</p>
<p>I can’t tell whether it’s cloudy or clear skies above me. And maybe that’s a good thing, because I can always imagine that there’s a blue, clear sky overhead and the sun is shining bright. I’ve never seen blue, but I imagine it’s the color of adventure, of a new day.</p>
<p>Of hope.</p>
<p>Of course, I’ve always thought green was a rather hopeful color as well. But who ever heard of a green sky? Ah well, it’s all the same to me.</p>
<p>The wagon rumbles on as I, Laken Godart, [Emperor], prepare to go to Invrisil, the City of Adventurers to save my poor village from starvation and monsters. I lie back, breath in. And at last—</p>
<p>I begin to explore this vast world.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Erin Solstice carefully flipped a fish on the frying pan she was holding over the fire. She watched the one golden-brown side of the fish turn over and land neatly on the oily surface of the pan. Instantly, the uncooked side began to sizzle.</p>
<p>“Mm. Fish.”</p>
<p>That was all she said for a while. There was nothing else that needed to be said. She just inhaled and smelled the fillet as it cooked. When it was done, she had a plate ready. She slid the still-juicy, crispy-golden fillet off the pan and looked at it.</p>
<p>It was a bit of perfection, at least for her. Back home, she’d never made anything nearly as good as this, not even close. The old Erin wouldn’t even have known where to begin, let alone mix up the batter that gave the fish such a nice, spicy taste.</p>
<p>And indeed, this fillet could have probably won her an award if she’d entered it in a local cooking competition. Erin knew it certainly could have gotten her a job at a local restaurant.</p>
<p>And it was all because she had a Skill. Erin stared at the fillet as it gently steamed on her pan. It really was a wonderful bit of food she’d created.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>Erin turned with the plate in her hands, and then dumped the fillet she’d just fried to perfection onto a cutting board. She diced the fillet in a few seconds with a cooking knife, and then shoved the remains into another pot.</p>
<p>This pot contained soup. To be more accurate, it contained blue soup, thick as molasses, with bits of green and some kind of yellow substance that looked like mutated pond scum bubbling to the surface. Erin mixed in what had been the wonderful fillet and sighed.</p>
<p>“It looks awful. But I <em>think</em> it will work.”</p>
<p>Compared to the fillet the soup looked about as appetizing as dirt. Undeterred, Erin poured some into a wooden bowl. Carefully, she took it out of the small kitchen and into the shop. There she stopped and called out.</p>
<p>“Octavia? I’ve got more soup for you to try!”</p>
<p>No one replied to her voice. Erin frowned and looked around. Octavia’s small shop, Stitchworks, was fairly big, but it felt cramped because of all the shelves full of potions and alchemy reagents stockpiled everywhere. Thus, she quickly found the dark-skinned girl with braids hiding under one of the tables.</p>
<p>“There you are! Come out and try the soup!”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to. You can’t make me!”</p>
<p>Octavia refused to budge, even when Erin put down the bowl of soup and poked her a few times in the side.</p>
<p>“Come on out. I promise it’s not going to be that bad this time.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to. <em>You</em> eat it!”</p>
<p>Erin put her hands on her hips and sighed.</p>
<p>“You’re the one with all the Skills that prevent you from being poisoned or dying, remember? And I don’t have a detachable stomach.”</p>
<p>“Just because I can eat it, doesn’t mean it tastes good! And I still feel the effects of what I eat! I was squatting over the toilet for hours after that last soup you made!”</p>
<p>“Aw, come on. You weren’t there <em>that</em> long…this time will be different, I promise! I didn’t add anything dangerous to the food this time.”</p>
<p>“No! Eat it yourself if you’re so confident!”</p>
<p>The girl hesitated, and stared at the bowl of soup on the table. It was probably safe. Her [Dangersense] wasn’t going off, at any rate. But she didn’t want to taste it, even so.</p>
<p>“Octavia…”</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>“I’ll pay you.”</p>
<p>There was silence. Octavia slowly poked her head out from underneath the table.</p>
<p>“How much?”</p>
<p>“Four silver coins?”</p>
<p>“Hah!”</p>
<p>The head withdrew. Erin thought quickly.</p>
<p>“Fine! Two gold coins! <em>If</em> it makes you sick or does anything bad to you. Deal?”</p>
<p>“Deal!”</p>
<p>Octavia was out from underneath the table in a second. Erin sighed, but there was something gratifying about how easy it was to just pay Octavia to do things. The Stitch Girl had a refreshingly simple way of looking at the world. If it was profitable, it was probably worth doing.</p>
<p>Even if the it in question involved eating another one of Erin’s soups. But then, Ryoka <em>had</em> paid Octavia quite handsomely to help Erin, so in that sense, Octavia was actually earning more for just doing her job.</p>
<p>Then again, even Erin had to admit she’d been feeding Octavia a lot of horrible stuff over the last few days. She would have actually volunteered to eat some of it herself, but without Octavia’s Skills that helped protect her against acid, burns, poisoning, and other nasty effects, the [Alchemist] would have been dead from eating some of what Erin had cooked up.</p>
<p>Instead, she’d just gotten horribly, sometimes violently, ill. Which explained her reluctance to sample any more of Erin’s experiments. However, Octavia loved gold even more than her health, so she didn’t look that put out as she stretched and looked at Erin.</p>
<p>“Alright. What horror am I supposed to be eating this time?”</p>
<p>Erin beamed as she showed Octavia the bowl. To her credit, the Stitch Girl didn’t even blink at the appearance of the soup. She sniffed at it cautiously as the human girl explained.</p>
<p>“It’s a variant of the last stew I made. This time I think it’s all mixed correctly.”</p>
<p>“Hmf.”</p>
<p>Octavia sniffed disparagingly; her nature as an [Alchemist] made her look down on all of what she called Erin’s ‘abominations of cooking and magic’.</p>
<p>“You found a way to stop the Stonelizard scales from mixing with the lemon juice and melting?”</p>
<p>Erin hesitated.</p>
<p>“I…think so. I kept the heat low and made sure to add a lot of mint. The soup hasn’t melted through the bottom of the bowl, so it probably worked.”</p>
<p>Octavia sighed. But she obediently picked up a spoon and gingerly spooned some of the blue glop into her mouth. She chewed a bit and swallowed as Erin held her breath—then Octavia made a face.</p>
<p>“It’s all <em>mushy!</em>”</p>
<p>“Eat!”</p>
<p>The girl did so, albeit reluctantly. Erin stared at the stitching around Octavia’s neck as the Stitch Girl slowly consumed the bowl of soup. It still seemed weird to her that Octavia was actually just cloth held together by string. Shouldn’t some of the soup leak out around the stitches, no matter how tightly it was sewn? But apparently, once Octavia’s cloth parts were connected, they acted like real flesh and blood.</p>
<p>The sound of the spoon scraping the bottom of the bowl made Erin look at Octavia sharply. The [Alchemist] sighed in relief as she put the spoon down and looked up at Erin.</p>
<p>“…Huh. It tasted pretty foul. Way too minty, and was that fish in there?”</p>
<p>Erin nodded, smiling.</p>
<p>“The pan frying and batter did the trick. The fish helped warm the soup without making it burn like last time.”</p>
<p>“Smart, I guess.”</p>
<p>Octavia looked grudgingly impressed. One of the biggest challenges Erin had had to overcome was the issue of heat. Octavia could regulate the temperature of her potions with ice and flame, but Erin had less options when it came to cooking. Just making the soup bubble in some cases could lead to dramatic—and dangerous—reactions.</p>
<p>“I think it might have worked.”</p>
<p>The [Alchemist] said this after a few minutes. She prodded at her stomach. Erin felt surprised, and immediately happy.</p>
<p>“You’re sure?”</p>
<p>“Pretty much. One of my Skills would have kicked in by now and I’d definitely be feeling the effects if anything harmful was in the soup. The only thing to test now is whether the effects were reproduced.”</p>
<p>“Oh. How are you going to test it? I could hit you—”</p>
<p>“No, thank you. I’ll use a pin instead.”</p>
<p>So saying, Octavia went up to her counter and rummaged around below it. She came up with a small box of pins, some scissors, and quite a few spools of thread. Erin guessed that was the equivalent of a first aid kit for Octavia.</p>
<p>“Alright, here goes.”</p>
<p>Octavia pulled out a rather long and sharp pin out of the box and extended her arm. Erin expected her to lightly poke at her flesh, so she was shocked when Octavia took the pin and pressed it straight into the center of her arm.</p>
<p>“Oh! <em>Ow!</em>”</p>
<p>“Hrgh.”</p>
<p>It looked as bad as it must have felt. The innkeeper winced as Octavia pushed the pin into her skin with all her strength, grimacing with pain as she did. Erin held her breath—it was almost hard to watch, but she had to know if the soup had worked.</p>
<p>“Well, would you look at that?”</p>
<p>Octavia’s grimaced expression changed to one of amazement. The Stitch Girl held up the pin, and Erin felt a jolt of elation in her stomach as she saw the pin was bent.</p>
<p>“It worked!”</p>
<p>“It did.”</p>
<p>Erin threw up her hands and shouted in delight. Octavia just stared down at the pin, blinking as if she couldn’t believe it. Once Erin had calmed down—she couldn’t really run around waving her arms in the shop without knocking over something delicate—she and Octavia sat together and discussed Erin’s latest creation.</p>
<p>“It really works, doesn’t it! Your skin is tougher—although it still hurt when you poked yourself with the pin, didn’t it?”</p>
<p>“A bit. I was more ready for the pain than anything else.”</p>
<p>Octavia studied the pot of blue sludge and Erin’s scrawled notes, shaking her head.</p>
<p>“This is—insane. It’s definitely a magical effect like you’d get from a potion, but how are you coming up with this stuff? First the strength stew and the Corusdeer soup that warms you up—now this?”</p>
<p>Erin beamed as she circled the particular combination of ingredients that had worked on the grubby piece of parchment.</p>
<p>“I’m on a roll. And you said it couldn’t be done!”</p>
<p>“I was wrong, clearly. That’s my mistake. Why does everything have to be a <em>soup</em>, though?”</p>
<p>Erin shrugged.</p>
<p>“Soup is easiest. I’ve tried batters, but I need to get all the ingredients right before I can use them. Now that I know the ingredients for this soup for instance—I could probably make a stir-fry or something out of it!”</p>
<p>“Huh.”</p>
<p>Octavia fell silent, drumming her fingers on the kitchen counter. Erin stopped and stared at the other girl.</p>
<p>It had been nearly a full day since Ryoka had run out of the city. It had been even longer since Erin had come to Celum—nearly a full week, in fact. And all that time she’d been splitting her time between Miss Agnes’ inn, the Frenzied Hare, and Octavia’s shop, Stitchworks. As a result, Erin was not only financially sound for the moment—Agnes had told her she was earning more in a week than she and her husband normally did in a month—but she’d managed to come up with some amazing new discoveries in Octavia’s shop!</p>
<p>Erin had been trying to cook with alchemical ingredients to create foods just as amazing as the soup she’d come up with that Ryoka kept using. And she’d made progress. Amazing progress, even Octavia had agreed. It was just that…</p>
<p>Some of Erin’s elation faded away as she stared at the soup in the pot. It had taken her nearly a hundred tries to mix this up, costing countless gold coins’ worth of ingredients. That wasn’t the issue, though.</p>
<p>Octavia didn’t seem to notice Erin’s feelings. She idly poked the pin into her hand as she stared at the soup.</p>
<p>“You know, if you want to try making the soup into an actual dish I wouldn’t mind trying it again.”</p>
<p>“Maybe later. I want to try and finish the other dishes, though.”</p>
<p>“More?”</p>
<p>The Stitch Girl frowned at Erin.</p>
<p>“How many more times are you going to come over and take over my shop? I do need to make potions myself, you know.”</p>
<p>Erin nodded absently.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but Ryoka bought out your time.”</p>
<p>“She did, but…”</p>
<p>Octavia waved her hands in the air, trying to express her displeasure.</p>
<p>“It’s been—how long? Nearly a week?”</p>
<p>“Something like that.”</p>
<p>Erin helped herself to her own bowl of soup now that she knew it probably wouldn’t kill her. She made a face as she tasted the horrible dish she’d made—the mint really was too powerful, but it was sour as well! She’d have to find some other way to combine all the ingredients—blend the mint into the fillet batter and keep the lemon juice out of it until the very end, or something.</p>
<p>But the dish <em>was</em> edible. Octavia shook her head as she stared at the small pot of soup Erin had brewed up.</p>
<p>“How am I supposed to deal with this? You’ve just created—what? A Thickskin potion? But you’ve used way less reagents than I usually do.”</p>
<p>“Mhm.”</p>
<p>Octavia glared at Erin, incensed by the bland response.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know how incredible that is? If you could do that with every potion I’ve made—just think of the savings! This is amazing! Revolutionary!”</p>
<p>“Yup. This really tastes bad.”</p>
<p>Erin made a face and Octavia made a sound of disgust.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll admit that you have some skill at this. But—and I’m asking again—how many more times are you going to use my kitchen and store?”</p>
<p>“Ten thousand times.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“Ten thousand times. That’s how many times I’m going to cook. If I can, that is.”</p>
<p>Erin suddenly felt very tired as she turned to Octavia. The dark-skinned girl’s mouth was open in shock, but her eyes were flittering left to right in sudden calculation.</p>
<p>“If you did that, I’d have to at least charge you—”</p>
<p>“I’m not being serious! Jeez!”</p>
<p>The Human girl scowled at Octavia. Octavia scowled back.</p>
<p>“You could have fooled me! I’m just giving you a price quote. Why ten thousand times, anyways?”</p>
<p>Erin sighed. But she felt like explaining, so she took a seat and spoke to Octavia between spoonfuls of the horrid soup.</p>
<p>“Back where I come from—there’s this guy who said that the best way to get good at something was to do it ten thousand times. Or something like that.”</p>
<p>Wasn’t it ten thousand hours spent practicing? Erin couldn’t actually remember that well.</p>
<p>“Anyways, the idea is that if you want to learn how to do something well—really well, I mean, you have to practice that much. You can be as talented as you want, but in the end you still need to practice.”</p>
<p>“Oh. So that’s why you’re trying to make all this stuff?”</p>
<p>“Sort of.”</p>
<p>Erin nodded, stretching her neck out a bit and wincing at the <em>cracks</em>. How long had she been cooking today? Already three hours, probably.</p>
<p>“I have a Skill—[Advanced Cooking]. It lets me cook really well without practice. But lots of people have that Skill. I’m an [Innkeeper], but there are a lot of people with higher levels than me, I bet. They have better inns, more Skills…I want to match them, somehow. So I decided to try to learn something new—even if this is boring.”</p>
<p>“Boring?”</p>
<p>“Boring. I think making all this alchemical stuff is boring. I know you don’t—”</p>
<p>Octavia’s outraged glare was proof enough of her feelings. Erin just shook her head tiredly.</p>
<p>“—But I don’t like wasting food, and making all this complex stuff. But it’s all that I can do.”</p>
<p>The other girl paused before she could give Erin a tongue-lashing.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I’m not like Ryoka. She can run around and do cool things—she’s even got Ivolethe as a friend.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>Erin ignored the question. She stared at the mostly empty bowl of soup and took another bite. It tasted awful. But it <em>was</em> magic.</p>
<p>“I can’t be a hero. I don’t like fighting, and I’m scared of getting eaten. Or stabbed. Or stabbed and eaten. All I can do is try and make my inn better. And if I had something magical to sell to my guests—no one would be able to copy that. That would make my inn unique. That’s why I’m doing all this.”</p>
<p>Even if it was hard. Even if it was exhausting. This was her big chance; Erin knew that. She raised her head and saw Octavia’s face. The girl didn’t look irate like she normally did around Erin. Instead, she looked impressed.</p>
<p>“That’s actually quite thoughtful for you.”</p>
<p>“Surprising, right?”</p>
<p>Octavia had to grin. Her teeth flashed in her dimly lit shop. Then she looked back at the bowl in Erin’s hands and her eyes narrowed in a calculating look that made Erin groan internally.</p>
<p>“You know—not that I’m trying to renegotiate the deal Ryoka made with me or anything—but you <em>have</em> benefited a lot from the recipes I’ve come up with. If you’d consider selling me them, I’d cut you in on a deal. In fact, why not let me sell them to other inns and taverns? Why, you’d earn a lot more if everyone was making this stuff and not just you. I’d only ask for a small commission on each sale—and I’m sure that the profits alone would—”</p>
<p>“It’s not going to work, Octavia.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know that! If you’d just listen to the rest of my idea—”</p>
<p>Erin shook her head, cutting the other girl off. She handed the recipe of the soup she’d just made to Octavia.</p>
<p>“Try making it yourself.”</p>
<p>The [Alchemist] was surprised, but she wasn’t one to turn down an opportunity to make something useful—and, Erin suspected, memorize the recipe. But although Octavia eagerly piled the ingredients into another pot and followed all of Erin’s instructions to the letter, her hands quickly slowed down as she frowned at the floating objects in the water of the pot.</p>
<p>“What’s happening? It—it’s not even reacting. It’s just sitting there. Like…”</p>
<p>“Like nothing is happening?”</p>
<p>Erin nodded and took the spoon from Octavia. As she began to stir, the soup began to change. Octavia’s eyes widened as she stared at the way the individual ingredients suddenly began to dissolve, mixing together.</p>
<p>“How are you doing that? A Skill?”</p>
<p>“Yup. It’s my Skill. Without it, no one else can make this stuff.”</p>
<p>Erin watched as the mixture slowly thickened, and continued following her instructions, although she knew how to make the soup by heart. She explained to Octavia as she reached for a glass of lemon juice she’d painstakingly squeezed earlier.</p>
<p>“I tried to show Agnes how to make the Corusdeer soup. She couldn’t do it, even when she copied me exactly.”</p>
<p>“What skill do you have? [Magical Cooking]? I know it can create magical dishes but this—this is different.”</p>
<p>“[Wondrous Fare]. That’s what I have.”</p>
<p>Erin didn’t tell Octavia how she’d gotten it, but she explained how she could make the faerie flower drink. True, alchemy ingredients weren’t the same as hallucinogenic faerie flowers, but Erin thought what she was doing still made sense. Octavia nodded, finger on her lips as she thought out loud.</p>
<p>“You’re probably bypassing one of the natural steps in the creation process. Perhaps you’re skipping the need for a particular reagent? There are some high-level [Alchemist] skills that can do the same. Some really save on costs since you can practically create lesser healing potions for free by skipping on the need to mix up the proper base first—”</p>
<p>She broke off, shrugging.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t really matter. But there goes my idea of marketing this stuff and making a fortune. Only you can make it, after all.”</p>
<p>Erin nodded, smiling a bit. But the smile slipped.</p>
<p>“It’s good. I’ve finally got something only I can make, and it’s useful. It’s just—I wish it wasn’t so boring, you know?”</p>
<p>“<em>Boring.</em>”</p>
<p>“Boring. Even though I worked this hard—there’s still so much more to do, Octavia.”</p>
<p>Erin stretched out on her seat, feeling her tendons snapping as she tried to shake off some of the tiredness that felt like it was in her bones.</p>
<p>“I’m just so—tired thinking about it. I’ll get back to my inn, and then I’ll start selling this stuff. But even though I’ll probably get more customers, I still need a new helper, to build up my inn, buy some magical runes—there’s just so much to do and I can only take one small step at a time. It’s exhausting.”</p>
<p>“So what? ”</p>
<p>Octavia just looked blank. Erin glared at her.</p>
<p>“Don’t you wish you could be more like Ryoka? She doesn’t have to do stuff like this. She just—runs. She can do amazing stuff. I wish I could do something cool so quickly.”</p>
<p>Erin sighed. She didn’t like fighting or anything like that. She wasn’t athletic as Ryoka was. She knew that. It was just that this was—well, it had been fun. But now she was just tired.</p>
<p>But Octavia just snorted in derision.</p>
<p>“Only adventurers and crazy people like Ryoka can become rich and famous quickly. Everyone else just has to work hard and gain as many levels at they can. I’m going to save every coin I can, level up and learn as many recipes as possible so I can expand my stores, make better potions, and do more business until I’m the highest-level [Alchemist] on the continent.”</p>
<p>She gestured around her small shop.</p>
<p>“I might not reach my dream for years, but it’s a lot safer than swinging a sword around. Well, safer when you’re not around, that is.”</p>
<p>“But that’s…”</p>
<p>She realized she didn’t really have anything to say against that. Erin let her voice trail off unhappily.</p>
<p>What Octavia was saying was right. She was taking the smart option. Even if being an [Alchemist] was slightly dangerous, it was nothing like being an adventurer. It was just so boring to think of, though. But part of Erin thought that was just what being an adult was like. It was thinking about the big picture. She knew that.</p>
<p>So then why did hearing it all laid out like that make her so depressed? Erin didn’t know, but she did come to one conclusion which made her sit up in her seat.</p>
<p>“I’m done cooking for the day.”</p>
<p>Both she and Octavia brightened up when she said it. Erin was fed up with making useless soup, and Octavia was tired of eating it.</p>
<p>“Good! I’ll just pour your horrible soup into a jar, shall I? I can probably sell it—at a markdown of course…I can give you a good split of the profits if you’d agree to oh, a vendor’s fee of—”</p>
<p>Erin left Stitchworks and Octavia behind mid-sentence, shaking her head. She didn’t mind Octavia—well, she did sometimes. But there were just some days when she needed some alone time. Or more precisely, not-Octavia time.</p>
<p>The sky was still gray and the streets were still snowy when Erin left the shop. She walked carefully so as not to slip as she wandered down the busy streets. Celum was always bustling, even if it was a smallish city. Erin walked past countless faces who didn’t seem that different from hers—Humans, going about their daily lives who didn’t give her a second glance.</p>
<p>That was reassuring, but also disheartening for some reason. Erin missed Liscor. She missed seeing Drakes and Gnolls, fantastic creatures going about their everyday lives. Celum was nice because it was reassuring, but it was also boring for the same reason.</p>
<p>Boring. That seemed to be the word of the day, didn’t it? Even though Erin had come up with an amazing discovery—she still felt the word in her soul.</p>
<p>Bored. She wanted to do something exciting. No—not just that. She wanted to be with someone exciting. She missed Ryoka already. And not just Ryoka. She missed all of her friends.</p>
<p>They were back in Liscor. And Erin was far from there. She kicked miserably at a patch of snow and then looked up. What about the Horns of Hammerad? That nice Runner guy had come by yesterday and told her Ryoka was going to see them. They were close by!</p>
<p>But just as she had that idea, Erin’s face fell. She could go meet them—Erin knew they were still probably in Ocre—but going there would be dangerous, wouldn’t it? Everyone was still talking about the Goblin attacks and besides, Ceria and the others would probably come here instead, if Ryoka had told them where Erin was.</p>
<p>All she had to do was wait. And practice her alchemical cooking while she still had time. Erin knew that.</p>
<p>But…she didn’t want to.</p>
<p>The sky was grey. The people wore thick clothing and walked briskly to get about their business as quickly as possible. Few people stopped to chat in the cold weather, and no one talked to Erin. She walked alone, staring at the city and feeling that this was all wrong.</p>
<p>This world was missing something.</p>
<p>Fun.</p>
<p>Octavia had said it: the people in this world didn’t really have much fun, did they? Back home, well, Erin knew there were crummy office jobs or backbreaking jobs with bad pay all over the place. But at least people could go back home and drive to a pool, or watch videos on the computer, or play videogames or—or do things.</p>
<p>But here? What did the people here have to do in their spare time? As far as Erin could tell, they just kept working. They worked hard to earn more levels, or to be rich, or to enjoy themselves. But that was always for ‘later’, never now.</p>
<p>There was just something so <em>wrong</em> about this idea that Erin couldn’t stand it. How could anyone live like this? Was this really what life had been like back in her world, back before the modern era?</p>
<p>What did people do for fun back in the Middle Ages? Erin couldn’t remember. Go to festivals? See jugglers and performers? Get drunk?</p>
<p>This wasn’t the Middle Ages of course—there was a lot more handy technology, not to mention magic. But magic seemed so far away in day-to-day life, even in Octavia’s shop. Oh, there were [Mages] around who cast spells like [Message] all day, but that wasn’t real <em>magic. </em>That was just more work.</p>
<p>If she’d been back home, what would Erin be doing right now? Thinking about college, or being in college no doubt. But if she’d just been back at home, she would have been practicing chess, debating calling one of her friends, watching a Youtube video, talking with her pare—</p>
<p>Nope! Can’t do that! Erin stopped in the street and slapped her cheeks hard enough for them to sting. She couldn’t think about home or friends or fa—</p>
<p>She couldn’t think about it. She’d done well so far, but being in a city full of Humans was making her nostalgic. And Erin didn’t need nostalgia right now. She needed…</p>
<p>“A distraction.”</p>
<p>So saying, Erin set off walking in a specific direction. She wasn’t far from where she wanted to go, so in a few minutes she was pushing open the door to the Frenzied Hare.</p>
<p>“Miss Erin!”</p>
<p>A welcoming voice instantly called out her name. Erin turned, smiling, to see Miss Agnes bustle up to her, all cheer and good humor.</p>
<p>“Why Erin, it’s a surprise to see you this early! Are you already done with your business at the [Alchemist]’s? Or—don’t tell me, Miss Octavia’s concocted some nasty brew that’s set her store on fire again?”</p>
<p>“Nothing like that Miss Agnes. I just finished up early. How’s Mister Jerom doing?”</p>
<p>Erin smiled at the older woman as she took a seat at the table. While it was true she was sort of the new boss around here—at least when it came to cooking—Miss Agnes was the one always running the inn, and Erin was gone outside of breakfast and dinner most days.</p>
<p>Miss Agnes smiled at Erin as she always did when Erin asked about her sick husband. Ryoka never asked, even though Erin kept reminding her to. Although…Erin wasn’t sure Ryoka even remembered Mister Jerom’s name, or Agnes’ some days.</p>
<p>“He’s doing as well as can be expected. Still feverish and he sleeps too much, but I’m hopeful the new alchemist’s potion we bought will sort him out. We have you to thank for that of course—we’d never have been able to spare the coin if you hadn’t come by.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s—I’m really glad I could help.”</p>
<p>Erin smiled and waved her hand. Agnes smiled at her, and then glanced at the kitchen.</p>
<p>“You know, if you’re done with work, I’m sure the morning crowd would love to sample your cooking—”</p>
<p>There it was again. Erin’s smile twisted a bit on her face. It was always work, work, work. Even here.</p>
<p>Agnes saw Erin’s expression and hurried to reassure her.</p>
<p>“We don’t have that many guests, and I’m sure if you’re not feeling up to it—”</p>
<p>“I’m just a bit tired today. Um, I was wondering if I could have some eggs?”</p>
<p>“Of course! Why, you must be tired—Maran! Some eggs for Miss Erin please!”</p>
<p>The [Barmaid] glanced up from one of the tables and waved at Erin in acknowledgement. Soon, she was back with the eggs, and she and Agnes sat with Erin and talked. The inn wasn’t at all crowded and Safry was cooking whatever was needed in the kitchen while she served the tables as well.</p>
<p>Erin chewed the decent eggs with a bit of pepper and salt added for flavoring and chatted with Maran and Agnes. They didn’t have much to say, to be honest. Business was good—but Erin knew that. Maran was dating another guy, a young [Cook] whom Agnes wanted to lure to the inn, but Maran wasn’t even sure if they were serious about each other—soon enough, Erin felt compelled to bring up the issue on her minds.</p>
<p>“Hey, I’ve been wondering…what do you guys do for fun?”</p>
<p>The two women exchanged a surprised glance.</p>
<p>“Well, what do you mean, Erin? If you’re asking about fun things to do on a date—Maran would know more about that.”</p>
<p>Erin shook her head.</p>
<p>“Not like that. I mean—what do you do for fun, when you have time, I mean? Read books?”</p>
<p>Agnes chuckled.</p>
<p>“Free time? There’s precious little of that here. And books? I’m sure Jerom and I don’t have the coin for that, even if I wanted to spend hours reading. No, that gives me a headache.”</p>
<p>“Then what do you do?”</p>
<p>Maran smiled.</p>
<p>“The other day I went shopping and bought a pair of earrings. The gemstones are just quartz—but they’re so beautiful and they sparkle in the light! I’ll show you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Okay. But…did you do anything else?”</p>
<p>The young woman blinked.</p>
<p>“Anything else? I didn’t have time to do anything else.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Well…what else do you do for fun?”</p>
<p>Maran and Agnes looked confused, but they told Erin what they did when they had a day off for whatever reason.</p>
<p>“I have been known to have a pint or two when the dinner rush is slow—usually with Jerom—”</p>
<p>“I’ll dance in any tavern, that is, if I haven’t been on my feet all day—”</p>
<p>“There’s a [Shepherd] who plays beautifully on a flute. He goes to other inns sometimes and plays—I wish I could have him here so we could listen to the music—”</p>
<p>Dance, drink, gamble, listen to music—Erin listened to the short list and felt the small hole in her heart grow wider. It wasn’t that any of it was bad, but it wasn’t interesting either. Her ears did perk up when she heard Maran mention a familiar word, though.</p>
<p>“Oh? You have holidays here too?”</p>
<p>“Of course! We have a few every year, and everyone looks forward to them.”</p>
<p>Apparently, even Agnes would close up her inn most of the day on such occasions. The entire city would celebrate special days in the year, a lot of them right around the time holidays were observed in Erin’s world.</p>
<p>“The real fun is during one of the festivals. There’s candied apples, games to play, entertainments bought by the city, and so much to do! The Winter Solstice is coming up—there’s always a good time to be had then.”</p>
<p>“And it’s such a romantic time as well.”</p>
<p>Maran sighed wistfully, and Erin suspected a certain [Cook] had been chosen to share that special day with. Agnes smiled mischievously.</p>
<p>“Of course, there’s another way some folks entertain themselves each night—”</p>
<p>“Miss Agnes!”</p>
<p>The [Barmaid] raised her voice in shocked outrage, and Agnes laughed. Both women looked at Erin—she looked just as unimpressed.</p>
<p>“Oh. Right.”</p>
<p>That’s it? Of course, Erin got the attraction, but besides festivals, was there really nothing else to do? Flummoxed by Erin’s indifference, Agnes and Maran tried to come up with other things that were fun to do.</p>
<p>“There’s always a good time when a [Troubadour], [Bard], [Tumbler], or some other person with a class like that visits. I always try and go see them if I have the time.”</p>
<p>“They wander from city to city?”</p>
<p>It made sense, but that was just as…well, at least they were some fun people who visited now and then. But still. It seemed like people in Celum just waited a long time for fun to occur. Erin sighed, even more melancholy than before.</p>
<p>Agnes looked a bit worried that Erin was so down.</p>
<p>“Are you well, Erin dear? Would you like to have a rest, maybe?”</p>
<p>“Nah. I’m not tired.”</p>
<p>Erin pushed her empty plate back and stood up. If there was no fun to be had here, at least she could see if…</p>
<p>“I’m going to go see Fuzzylips. I mean…yeah, him.”</p>
<p>“Who? Oh, you mean Wesle? You go visit him practically every day. Has he caught your eye?”</p>
<p>Maran and Agnes smiled knowingly at Erin. Erin gave them a blank look.</p>
<p>“Not really. I just want to know if he’s found my skeleton yet.”</p>
<p>“Your what?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Hey Wesle.”</p>
<p>The [Guardsman] had been napping, or maybe just resting his eyes, but he sat up in his wooden chair and looked attentive the moment he heard his name. He relaxed when he realized his superior wasn’t calling his name—and then he straightened up in his chair again when he realized Erin was standing in front of him.</p>
<p>“Oh, Miss Solstice! I didn’t realize—um, let me—would you like a seat?”</p>
<p>Fumbling at his words, blushing, Wesle stood up and offered Erin the only seat in the room. His. Erin just laughed at him until they left the small room which was meant for—well, probably napping [Guardsman]—and talked.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect you to be here so soon. Ah, what can I do for you, Miss Erin?”</p>
<p>“Any news about Toren?”</p>
<p>Wesle was ready for the question, because Erin asked it every day. He shook his head ruefully.</p>
<p>“You mean the skeleton? No, Miss Erin. I haven’t heard any of the cities reporting any sighting of the undead—and I did send out a request asking if any reports had been logged with the Adventurer’s Guilds as well.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Erin knew that was the response she’d likely get, but she sagged anyways. No one had seen Toren. Selys would have messaged her if he’d appeared around Liscor, but he hadn’t gone back there. And no one had mentioned seeing a walking skeleton around the cities either—it was like he’d disappeared.</p>
<p>Where was Toren now? And when she finally found him…would Erin really have to do what she was thinking? Maybe Pisces could help. But he wasn’t here yet.</p>
<p>Awkwardly, Wesle patted Erin on the shoulder. She smiled at him.</p>
<p>“That’s too bad. Thanks for looking, though.”</p>
<p>Wesle hesitated.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you won’t sit? You seem less spirited than usual, Miss Erin.”</p>
<p>“Really? I’m sorta…tired, I guess. You seem tired too.”</p>
<p>The [Guardsman] hesitated, and then nodded with a grimace.</p>
<p>“It’s Esthelm, Miss. Or rather, after that all the [Guardsmen] in every city are working around the clock.”</p>
<p>“In case the Goblins attack?”</p>
<p>“That, and trying to find out <em>when</em> they’ll attack, or at least, where they are.”</p>
<p>Wesle gestured to a large map that had been pinned to a wall of the City Watch barracks. It had a lot of colored pins in it, most of them centered around a red cross over what had been Esthelm. Erin’s stomach twisted a bit just looking at the map.</p>
<p>What about Rags? Another friend she couldn’t do anything for. She let Wesle explain the problem, hoping Rags wasn’t with any of the Goblins he was talking about.</p>
<p>“It’s not like there are Goblins everywhere now, but there are certainly more of them. Just the other day a village near Esthelm – Verdun – reported seeing a group of a hundred or so armed Goblins.”</p>
<p>The man showed Erin a small pin on the map. She stared at it and looked at how close it was to Liscor and Celum. A hundred Goblins? How many did Rags have…?</p>
<p>“These ones aren’t like the normal groups of Goblins. They all have weapons and armor—and they move and fight like they’re actual [Soldiers]. If the village didn’t have walls, I think they’d have been attacked. But the Goblins were moving north, and luckily no one was killed.”</p>
<p>“Are they attacking something?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s a war between Goblin tribes, Miss. It happens. Or—it could be this Goblin Lord we’ve been hearing rumors about.”</p>
<p>Wesle’s face was grim. Erin remembered that Goblin Lords were supposed to be really bad.</p>
<p>“You guys are working hard. Um. Do you work like this every day?”</p>
<p>“Well, most days we just arrest petty criminals and patrol, Miss. Or stand watch at the gate and check travelers coming in, like we did with you. It’s not always this exciting.”</p>
<p>The [Guardsman] gave Erin a faint grin. She nodded.</p>
<p>“And what about fun?”</p>
<p>“Fun, Miss?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Do you do…anything for fun in your free time?”</p>
<p>“Weeeell…”</p>
<p>Wesle looked uncomfortable. Suddenly encouraged, Erin grinned and nudged him.</p>
<p>“Come on. What do you do? Show me, please? I won’t tell.”</p>
<p>It took a bit of coaxing, but eventually Wesle led Erin behind the barracks and into the practice yard. It was for [Guardsmen] to swing a blade, but the bored men and women of the City Watch had installed an unauthorized addition to the place.</p>
<p>A horseshoe, rusted and battered from use, swung from Wesle’s hand. He tossed it across the snowy and muddy ground and landed it near, but not on the metal pole that had been hammered into the earth. He offered one to Erin, but she just stared at it. Erin looked at the horseshoe, and then at Wesle’s face.</p>
<p>“And this is what you do for fun?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Erin stared at the horseshoes. She stared at Wesle. Then she reached out and patted him gently on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“I’m <em>so</em> sorry.”</p>
<p>“Er, why?”</p>
<p>He never got an answer. Erin just walked away, shaking her head sadly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such a boring world. It actually amazed Erin that she could think that. But at times, it was true. Even here, there was boredom. Perhaps more boredom than back home.</p>
<p>Or—maybe it wasn’t the world that was boring, but some of the people living in it. Erin had never felt bored in Liscor, but she’d always had something to do. Here, she was just an observer, watching people live lives that—weren’t that interesting, to be honest.</p>
<p>Wesle was a [Guardsman]. Agnes was an [Innkeeper]. Octavia was an [Alchemist]. That was all they were and would be, and they leveled up and worked and lived, and that was all.</p>
<p>It wasn’t enough for Erin. She needed something else. But she had no idea of where to find it, so Erin just started walking. She walked out of the City Watch’s guardhouse and into the city, looking for something she wasn’t sure existed.</p>
<p>Where should she go? Erin came to a crossroads and turned left for no particular reason. She’d gone walking through the city before of course, but that was always with Ryoka. Today Erin walked down streets Ryoka would never turn.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that her friend was a snob—even though she sort of was. But it was that Ryoka always went from A to Z, and never bothered talking to H or exploring any places in between.</p>
<p>When she was in the city, Ryoka would just go to the marketplace—that was to say, the marketplace where people traded for gold and valuable items. She wouldn’t ever visit the stalls that sold Miss Agnes food, or venture into the poorer parts of the city.</p>
<p>Unless she was on a delivery. But most of Ryoka’s clients were rich, so she never ran down the streets Erin now walked down. The girl saw the way the buildings changed from stone to wood, the way their architecture became simpler, and the rare glass windows disappeared altogether.</p>
<p>And then—Erin was in a different world. She stared around at the faces of people who weren’t rich, or even close to it. She saw thin bodies, clothes that were badly patched or simply holey, and felt something different in her chest besides apathy.</p>
<p>These were poor people. Of course, it shouldn’t surprise Erin. Every world had poor people—people who couldn’t afford to eat. But she’d somehow forgotten that they existed here. Forgotten, because she’d never looked.</p>
<p>A girl passing by Erin looked like she could have used a few more meals. Erin tried not to stare, but she felt a…a kinship with the people who passed her by. She’d been like that, once. She’d had nothing, living in an empty inn that was falling apart.</p>
<p>And of course, there was no fun to be had here. Erin looked around and only saw misery mixed with desperation. Here were people who couldn’t even think about having fun. They lived on the edge.</p>
<p>It made her feel bad about complaining. Erin wavered, turned to go. She couldn’t feed these people, but maybe if she had scraps left over from cooking? But Maran and Safry took those back to their families. No one had too much. But was there something…?</p>
<p>Then Erin saw it. There were shops down this street as well, and the girl she’d passed had gone to one of them, to buy something at the stalls. But while she was waiting in the queue, a small shape moved furtively behind her. Erin recognized the young boy’s face at once. She’d seen him calling out to her when she’d entered the city, all innocence and smiles.</p>
<p>And now…he was picking a pocket. Or rather, cutting a purse. Erin saw him reaching for the young woman’s money pouch hidden just under her tunic and shouted.</p>
<p>“<em>Grev!</em>”</p>
<p>Every head turned, but the boy’s turned fastest. Grev’s eyes widened when he saw Erin, and then his face went dead white with recognition. The girl he’d been trying to rob turned and shrieked in horror when she saw the small knife in his hands, but it fell from nerveless fingers as Grev stared at Erin. Erin took one step towards him, and he ran.</p>
<p>“Oh no you don’t!<em> Get back here!</em>”</p>
<p>She ran after him, dashing past surprised people as Grev screamed and ran for his life. Erin didn’t know what she’d do when she caught him—hadn’t she threatened to shove a bee up his butt? She didn’t have any bees left, but she wasn’t too bothered by that. She was bored, and here was something to do.</p>
<p>Grev ran as if Carn Wolves were on his back, pushing past people, ignoring their curses. Erin ran a bit slower, dodging around people.</p>
<p>“Whoops! Sorry! Excuse me!”</p>
<p>She had Grev in her sights the entire time—until the boy turned down an alley! Erin skidded into it, wary for a second of an ambush, but she saw Grev turning around a corner. He was still running, so Erin gave chase.</p>
<p>Really, she had no idea why she was still running after him, but after five minutes of pursuit giving up was no longer an option. Erin <em>had</em> to catch Grev; it was a matter of pride.</p>
<p>Erin dashed down another poor street, practically unpaved and full of run down houses. Where was she? But there was Grev, trying to open a door!</p>
<p>“Gotcha!”</p>
<p>Before the frantic boy could open the door and get away, Erin seized him by one hand. He <em>shrieked</em> in fear and to Erin’s surprise, raised his other arm as he shrunk to the ground. As if he was afraid she would…hit…him…</p>
<p>She’d just processed that thought when Erin heard a voice.</p>
<p>“Stop, please!”</p>
<p>Someone grabbed her arm. The hand wasn’t big, but the touch was rough and whoever had grabbed her had <em>claws.</em> Erin jumped and let go of Grev. He ran behind his savior, a female Drake—</p>
<p>Erin blinked. She stared at the young Drake standing in front of her, holding a bundle of what looked like wet clothing in one claw while the other held Erin. The Drake let go of Erin and backed away instantly. She shielded Grev with her body as she spoke desperately to Erin.</p>
<p>“Please, Miss! Don’t hurt him! He’s just a child!”</p>
<p>“Wha?”</p>
<p>Why was a Drake in Celum? Erin hadn’t even seen one, but here was a Drake, standing in front of her. The Drake paused as she realized Erin wasn’t going to start hitting her. For a moment she and Erin just stared at each other while Grev hid behind her, sniveling.</p>
<p>“You’re a Drake.”</p>
<p>That was the brilliant opening Erin came up with. The female Drake hesitated, and then nodded. She bit at her lip, glaring at Erin as if that statement was a challenge.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I’m a Drake. But I live here, and the Watch knows about me.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry if Grev did anything—but he’s just a child! Please, whatever he did—”</p>
<p>“He was pickpocketing. I saw him.”</p>
<p>The Drake’s reaction was immediate, as was Grev’s. He immediately let go of her and piped up in denial.</p>
<p>“I never!”</p>
<p>“Oh Grev—”</p>
<p>She stared at him, clearly knowing he was lying. But instantly the Drake looked back at Erin, and now there was a genuine note of desperation in her voice.</p>
<p>“Please don’t report him, Miss. Please don’t. He’s only one crime away from being exiled from the city. And if that happens—it was just one mistake, Miss. It won’t happen again.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Erin propped her hands on her hips and stared at Grev as he tried to turn invisible.</p>
<p>“I happen to have met Grev before. He helped a bunch of thugs ambush me when I first came into the city.”</p>
<p>“<em>Grev!</em>”</p>
<p>The Drake turned. To Erin<em>’</em>s surprise, she dropped the clothing on the snowy cobblestones and grabbed Grev, lifting him up as he shouted.</p>
<p>“I—I—”</p>
<p>“<em>How dare you! </em>I’ll spank you until you won’t sit for two weeks! And you’re not having dinner! I should drag you to the City Watch myself. Do you want to be kicked out of the city? Because if you do—”</p>
<p>“I’m <em>sorry! I’msorryI’msorryI’m—</em>”</p>
<p>The Drake kept shaking Grev as he apologized frantically, shouting. Erin saw other doors opening and closing once the occupants saw what was going on, but no one came to see. She cleared her throat and the two stopped and stared at her.</p>
<p>Grev’s face was somewhere beyond white and going into ghostly. The Drake’s face was—well, her dark red scales couldn’t really change color like skin, but they were definitely looking more pink than red around her face. Both clearly expected the worst.</p>
<p>And why not? Erin wasn’t a huge, angry [Warrior], true, but she was dressed a lot better than they were, and she could easily summon the Watch. But to their surprise, the&nbsp; young woman didn’t shout or get angry. She just smiled a bit, and held out a hand.</p>
<p>“I’m Erin. Who are you?”</p>
<p>The Drake stared at the hand, and then dropped Grev. She gingerly took the hand.</p>
<p>“Jasi. My name is Jasi, Miss.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jasi the Drake was one of perhaps two or three Drakes in Celum.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. There was a [Merchant], but he might have left. And there’s a [Baker] who married a Human woman. But it’s not common, especially in small cities like this.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Jasi shifted in her seat. Erin was sitting in her home—hers and Grev’s. Apparently, they lived in a squalid hut—house was too grand a word for this place—next to the city walls. It had belong to their parents, both of whom were dead or had simply left. Erin hadn’t asked.</p>
<p>Now Erin sat on a rickety chair with a cup of boiled water in front of her. She hadn’t drunk from it. There were a few flecks in the water that she didn’t want in her stomach. Jasi sat across from her while Grev tried to listen to their conversation and hide in the other corner of the room.</p>
<p>Talking had happened. And spanking and apologizing and now explanations were currently occurring.</p>
<p>“You live pretty close to Liscor. I’d have thought more than one or two Drakes would live in cities, even Humans ones.”</p>
<p>“Well…people don’t like Drakes here. And I’ve heard that most Drakes don’t like Humans.”</p>
<p>Jasi looked uncomfortable as she spoke. She’d apologized a hundred times to Erin, but she was still clearly afraid Erin would go ballistic over Grev’s crimes, or, Erin realized, her being a Drake. She tried to reassure the young…woman.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry—I don’t mind Drakes. In fact, I live in Liscor where there are tons of them!”</p>
<p>“Liscor?”</p>
<p>Both Grev and Jasi exclaimed at the same time. Jasi looked at Erin with wide eyes.</p>
<p>“Really? But I heard Humans don’t live there. Unless—are you an adventurer, Miss?”</p>
<p>“Nope.”</p>
<p>“She is!”</p>
<p>Grev called out from one corner of the room. He was standing—as sitting would be very hard with his sore backside. He flinched when Erin and Jasi looked at him. But he piped up with the determination to be proved right.</p>
<p>“I saw her! She beat three big men by herself! She punched one of them so hard she broke his nose!”</p>
<p>“And whose fault is it she had to fight you <em>stupid—</em>”</p>
<p>Jasi raised her voice and nearly got up before Erin stopped her. She was all for punishing Grev, but he’d had enough, at least in her opinion.</p>
<p>“I’m not an adventurer. I’m an [Innkeeper]. I have an inn in Liscor and I happen to have a few combat Skills.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>“Did you come from Liscor?”</p>
<p>Jasi suddenly turned red, the scales around her face actually turning a lighter pink rather than darkening.</p>
<p>“Who me? No—I’ve actually never been to Liscor. Or…or anywhere with other Drakes, really.”</p>
<p>“What? Then how…?”</p>
<p>“It’s a long story, Miss.”</p>
<p>It came out as the cup of water in front of Erin slowly stopped steaming and went cold. It was cold in Jasi’s house, and it was her house. Erin had figured out some of the story just seeing how Jasi and Grev interacted, but the rest fell into place quickly enough.</p>
<p>Jasi was adopted. Or more accurately, she was a child that had been abandoned and found and raised by a Human father and mother. She’d lived in Celum all her life, but that life hadn’t been kind to her. Her parents—who’d taken care of her and taught her to live among Humans and then had Grev—had split up unhappily. The mother found another man, the father just…disappeared one day.</p>
<p>It was a sad story, the kind Erin had heard many times in her world. But to hear it here—was disheartening. But what Erin could admire throughout it was Jasi. She’d kept going even when her parents had gone. She’d found work, as a [Washer] although she only had a handful of levels, and she’d earned enough coin for her and Grev to survive.</p>
<p>The catch was that she couldn’t look after Grev and earn money at the same time. The street had raised him, and what Grev had learned was how to steal, and how to lure innocent people into ambushes. Jasi had known about the first part and done her best to stop that, but she hadn’t known about the muggings.</p>
<p>When Erin gave her the full recounting of what Grev had done when she’d first met him—and after she’d stopped threatening to bite Grev’s hands off, Jasi got down on her hands and knees and begged Erin for mercy.</p>
<p>“I swear to you, I’ll never let it happen again. <em>Please </em>don’t report him. He’s the only family I have left.”</p>
<p>What could Erin do but agree? Jasi made Grev apologize a hundred times, and promised to keep a better watch over him, but all Erin could wonder was when he’d be caught next, and what would happen then.</p>
<p>And from the look in Jasi’s eyes, she was thinking the same thing. That was how Erin found herself sitting in their grubby home, poking a finger into the very cold cup of water and watching as Jasi got back to her work.</p>
<p>She washed clothing for bronze coins, day in, day out. And she did it by using a tub of quite dirty water in the cold home and using lye soap and her claws to scrub the dirty fabrics as clean as she could.</p>
<p>It was hard, backbreaking work, especially since Jasi didn’t exactly have any racks to dry the clothes on, let alone a washer and dryer. Instead, she hung bits of rope from stands—chairs, the ceiling, and so on, letting the clothing drip-dry as the small fire she kept going in the fireplace added smoke to the cold room.</p>
<p>Erin didn’t know if she liked Jasi. She certainly felt bad for her, but that wasn’t the same as liking her. But she felt she couldn’t just walk out of the home. Not when she looked at Jasi’s hands, or rather, her claws.</p>
<p>Her scales were paler and—damaged around her claws. Some were even missing, revealing pale white skin underneath. It was clearly painful from the way the Drake girl avoided brushing up against the exposed parts where she could. Erin could only guess that her work washing clothes had scraped away her scales one at a time.</p>
<p>It was like…seeing how her life could have gone. Maybe. Jasi was a stranger in a city full of people who weren’t like her, and didn’t <em>like</em> her. And what was more, she had to take care of Grev. It was a thankless, soul crushing task. And Erin…</p>
<p>Erin felt at her belt pouch. She had gold coins and silver coins in there, courtesy of her work as an [Innkeeper] at Miss Agnes’ inn. She had more bronze coins than Jasi and Grev had together. If she gave them just one gold coin, what would happen?</p>
<p>Happiness, perhaps for a day? Then it would be back to normal. Maybe Jasi could buy something to help her with washing, but the place they were in wouldn’t change that much.</p>
<p>What about all the coins? They’d probably get robbed. And even then, when it ran out they’d still be poor. Erin was no social worker, no expert in charity and relief management, but she knew this wasn’t a good option.</p>
<p>But what else could be done? She could…walk out and leave them alone. But Erin rejected that as well. And yet—how many people were like Jasi? If Erin went next door, she was sure she’d probably feel the exact same way about the people living there.</p>
<p>But she knew Jasi, and Grev. She knew their names. That made things different. Just knowing their names meant it was so hard to walk away.</p>
<p>“Grev! Help me lift this, will you? And don’t drop it or I’ll have to wash it again!”</p>
<p>Jasi snapped at Grev as she struggled to lift some wet shirts up. Erin sat back down as Grev ran over. She watched them work.</p>
<p>Yes. If she helped them half-heartedly, she wouldn’t change much, would she? But if she gave them everything, what would happen to her?</p>
<p>What would Ryoka do? Would she come up with a brilliant solution, or would she just shake her head and say this is how the world was and walk away? Erin didn’t know.</p>
<p>She saw the female Drake wince as the clothing wrapped around a patch of exposed skin where the scales had been torn away. But she made no sound.</p>
<p>Erin looked at the windows. The shutters were closed—obviously they had no glass windows, but even the shutters had gaps in them, letting in the winter air. And the floor was filthy. When had they last cleaned? And the water in the tub—Jasi must have hauled it here, and when would she be able to replace it? Only when it became impossible to wash with, Erin bet.</p>
<p>So hard. Hard, and—and small. This was all they had, and even that was uncertain. Erin’s heart ached as she looked at Grev, reluctantly helping Jasi hang up clothes to dry by the fire. She thought, and came to a decision, even though it might have been the wrong one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Miss Erin…what’s this?”</p>
<p>That was what Agnes said when Erin brought Jasi and Grev to the inn. They stared at the bustling place, wide-eyed and disbelieving, an expression that was mirrored on Agnes’s face when Erin told her what she intended.</p>
<p>“You want to hire her as a [Barmaid]? Well of course we could use the help but—does she have any levels in the class? And what about the boy?”</p>
<p>“Grev can stay here. He can’t work, but he can sleep here. I don’t know what he’ll do every day—I’ll think of something to keep him out of trouble.”</p>
<p>Jasi bobbed a nervous curtsy to Miss Agnes.</p>
<p>“I’ll work hard, Miss. If you need me to haul things or clean up—I can do that. Anything you need.”</p>
<p>“I—well—we’ll see.”</p>
<p>Agnes looked helplessly at Erin. She gave the uncertain Jasi and Grev a big smile and had them sit at a table.</p>
<p>“We’ll—have Safry bring you some food. You two look like you could use some. Safry! And then we’ll put you to work, Miss Jasi.”</p>
<p>As the two sat and Safry came over, Agnes drew Erin aside and spoke to her in a troubled voice.</p>
<p>“I hate to question you, but—do you know what you’re doing, Erin? This seems…sudden. Have you thought all this through?”</p>
<p>“No. Not really.”</p>
<p>Miss Agnes looked somewhat dismayed by Erin’s honest response. But the truth of it was that Erin herself was uncertain. When she’d stood up and announced that Jasi could work at her inn, it had felt right. But now—</p>
<p>“I know you come from Liscor where Drakes are common—but here Drakes are—well, there’s history—”</p>
<p>“I know, Miss Agnes. But I had to do something.”</p>
<p>“You have a kind heart, Erin. I know that.”</p>
<p><em>But you made a mistake. </em>Erin heard it unspoken in Agnes’ voice. She ignored it.</p>
<p>“For now just have Jasi wait tables. That’s easy. And Grev can eat and sit in a corner.”</p>
<p>So passed the first night. Erin kept an eye on Jasi, and especially Grev. But Grev was meek and even grateful for the food, eating a huge amount until Erin thought he would be sick. But he eventually just passed out in a minor food coma at his table.</p>
<p>As for Jasi, she still seemed stunned to work at such as busy inn. She was constantly serving tables, bringing the food Erin cooked out of the kitchen. And even if she got quite a few glances, Erin heard no audible comments, at least, not while she was in the common room.</p>
<p>She cooked, fried, and served food in her own world of anxiety. Then, when the last of the guests had eaten, Erin found a small room for Jasi and Grev to sleep in.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how to thank you, Miss Erin. Are you sure it’s alright for us to be sleeping here? We have a house—”</p>
<p>“I’m sure. And this way you can help in the morning.”</p>
<p>Erin smiled at Jasi and Grev, keeping her emotions inside of her until they’d closed the door. Then she went to her own room and sat on her bed and put her head in her hands.</p>
<p>“Was that a mistake?”</p>
<p>It felt like it. Erin hated to say it out loud, but she wasn’t sure. What had she just done? It had been so sudden, an impulse decision.</p>
<p>“But what was I <em>thinking?</em>”</p>
<p>Making Jasi a [Barmaid]? Offering her a job? It had seemed like the only option Erin could take. The obvious choice. But now that she was here—</p>
<p>It wasn’t a good fit. Jasi would work hard, but Erin had seen the looks the patrons of the inn gave her. She was a Drake, and unpopular. Plus, she would have to start at Level 1 and work her way up as a [Barmaid]. Agnes had expressed her doubts, and no wonder. Did Agnes even like Jasi? What about Maran and Safry? Would they be afraid Jasi would take their jobs or steal their wages since Erin had hired her? What about when Erin was gone? Would Agnes fire Jasi then and there?</p>
<p>And when Erin left…could she take Jasi with her? Would the Drake be willing to go back to Liscor? What about Grev? He wouldn’t be happy in that city, and the Liscorian City Watch was hard on crime, especially by Humans.</p>
<p>Especially after Lyonette.</p>
<p>Erin tossed and turned in her bed. She knew she’d made a bad choice. But could she just leave them there? But now—she’d taken then out of their home. What could she do? Jasi might have lost her job since Erin had taken her away! Could Erin just give her money and tell her to go back if things didn’t work out?</p>
<p>She didn’t know. Erin lay sleepless in her bed, trying to figure out what the right answer was. But she was only sure of one thing. One simple thing: of all the things she could have done, the worst thing would have been nothing.</p>
<p>She’d made her choice. Now she would help Jasi—and Grev—as much as she could. That was all she could do.</p>
<p>Exhausted, but knowing she had to sleep, Erin finally closed her eyes. She mumbled to herself as sleep finally overwhelmed her stressed brain.</p>
<p>“At the very least…I have something to do.”</p>
<p>She closed her eyes and slept.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>She wished she had an iPod. That’s what Erin thought when she woke up in her small bed on the second floor of Miss Agnes’ inn. It was probably because she’d made the mistake of thinking about home yesterday.</p>
<p>Ryoka had her iPhone. She’d kept it even though she’d gone to a whole new world. Whereas Erin hadn’t. True, she didn’t usually bring her phone on bathroom breaks, but if she ever got back she’d take one everywhere she went. And she’d bring an emergency backpack of everything—</p>
<p>If she ever went back. Erin slapped her head.</p>
<p>“Stop!”</p>
<p>Nothing good happened when she thought about home. The only thing that ever happened was—well, weeping and moping and crippling desperation. That’s why Erin had stopped thinking about it on purpose, starting all those days ago when she’d cried herself to sleep in a broken inn in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>She was here, and she had to survive. Erin got up and dressed herself blearily. She couldn’t smile—she felt weighed down by heavy thoughts. And she felt even more tired when she remembered her new employee.</p>
<p>“What do I do? What did you do, stupid Erin?”</p>
<p>She gently thumped her head against a wall. Someone grunted in the next room and Erin winced.</p>
<p>“Oops.”</p>
<p>There was no going back. She could only do what was right. And what was right was—</p>
<p>Erin came down the stairs with a determined smile on her face. She’d find something Jasi could do. She’d help her succeed as a [Barmaid]—or do something else. Because even if Erin couldn’t help everyone, she would never leave the Drake and her brother alone. If she did, she wouldn’t be Erin Solstice.</p>
<p>And yet—not everyone was like her. That was why Erin’s smiled twisted the instant she walked down into the common room of the inn and saw what was happening.</p>
<p>“Oh, Erin, my dear!”</p>
<p>Miss Agnes looked up from the table where she was sitting with Jasi. Across the room, Erin saw Safry cleaning the tables before the day started and the one or two early guests waiting for breakfast. Erin looked around the room as she descended the steps. Grev was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>“Miss Agnes. And Jasi. What’s happening? And where’s Grev?”</p>
<p>Jasi gave Erin a warm, but—uncomfortable—smile. She was sitting somewhat tensely in front of Miss Agnes, and Erin could tell the other [Innkeeper] was—</p>
<p>“What’s all this?”</p>
<p>Miss Agnes didn’t seem to notice the edge in Erin’s tone. She smiled at Erin, beamed, rather, like she always did.</p>
<p>“Well, I was just having a chat with Jasi about her future.”</p>
<p>“Her future? What do you mean, Miss Agnes?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I was thinking about it all night. And I had a chat with Jerom—you did a wonderful thing, helping Jasi and Grev. But although I’m sure she’d be a wonderful [Barmaid], I thought we could explore all her options. After all, Jasi’s so young—I wouldn’t want her to level up in a class that didn’t fit her perfectly, would I?”</p>
<p>For two seconds, because she’d had a bad time waking up and because she’d been hanging out with Ryoka too long, Erin thought about punching Miss Agnes in the face. But she suppressed that instinct at once.</p>
<p>“I see. You want to help Jasi find a job. Another job.”</p>
<p>“Well, I was just thinking how nice it would be if she could find a class she really liked. Being a [Barmaid] isn’t for everyone, and if we can find something that suits her better…”</p>
<p>Miss Agnes met Erin’s eyes innocently. But the message was clear. And it was infuriating to Erin.</p>
<p>Jasi hadn’t even been here one whole day, and Miss Agnes had decided that her inn was not for the Drake. And better yet—she’d talked it over with Mister Jerom, her husband, had she? Erin had visited the sick [Innkeeper] and she knew any conversation Agnes had with him was completely one-sided. She probably just chattered on to him as he groaned in bed and coughed up phlegm.</p>
<p>“So you’ve been helping Jasi since you woke up? That was kind of you.”</p>
<p>“Well, I had time. And I was waiting for you to be up so we could start with breakfast—you really have a talent for cooking, my dear!”</p>
<p>“You mean a Skill. Where’s Grev?”</p>
<p>Normally Erin met most things with a good attitude. But this morning she wasn’t in the mood for niceness. Agnes blinked at her.</p>
<p>“Oh. I sent him outside to play. I’m sure he’ll be back when he’s hungry. Young boys always live by their stomachs.”</p>
<p>And how would Miss Agnes know that? <em>She’d</em> never had a kid. Of course, Erin hadn’t ever had one either, but there was just something about the other innkeeper that was rubbing Erin the wrong way today.</p>
<p>It was just that she’d decided to kick Jasi out. The Drake clearly understood what the [Innkeeper]’s intentions were, no matter how much she smiled, and she looked justifiably upset. Erin glanced across the room and saw Safry glance at her and then quickly away. Safry knew what was going on. Did Maran? Had this been agreed on by all three women or just Agnes?</p>
<p>Who knew? Erin could only move forwards, and so she smiled at Agnes and Jasi.</p>
<p>“Well, I’d love to help with that.”</p>
<p>“But breakfast—”</p>
<p>Miss Agnes coughed delicately and Erin frowned.</p>
<p>“It can wait. Or better yet, this can wait.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s no trouble my dear. I’m perfectly willing to help young Jasi out while you cook.”</p>
<p>Erin gritted her teeth. There was an…air about Agnes. It was almost written on her face ‘let’s help the children find what they’re good at so I won’t have to deal with them!’&nbsp; It made her upset, and even angrier that Agnes was deliberately sending Erin into the kitchen to cook.</p>
<p>She wanted to object. Erin opened her mouth, but the problem was—Agnes was right. Erin needed to make breakfast for the hungry masses who’d soon be coming here for her good cooking. And yet—she didn’t want to leave Jasi alone with Agnes.</p>
<p>But was it really a problem? Erin thought about that for a moment. It wasn’t as if Agnes was kicking Jasi out this moment. She was going to work with Jasi—even if it was selfish. Would it be that bad to let her help?</p>
<p>Well…yes and no. Agnes would certainly help because it meant Jasi and Grev would be out of her hair. But she’d probably not look for the best class to suit them—she’d probably compromise instantly and choose whatever they were good at without exploring all the options.</p>
<p>But she would help. It just meant Erin would have to make sure Agnes didn’t rush things along. And it meant that Miss Agnes wasn’t the person Erin had thought she was.</p>
<p>She was just a woman. Good to her friends and family, but no better than that. It wasn’t a crushing realization, but it just made Erin’s heart hurt a bit.</p>
<p>She let none of that show on her face as she smiled at Agnes.</p>
<p>“Good idea. I’ll make breakfast, and then come back and help Jasi. I hope you’re hungry.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Are you planning on making something special today?”</p>
<p>Agnes smiled at Erin. Erin smiled back.</p>
<p>“Mm. I think I’ll make some crepes and French toast. And bacon.”</p>
<p>Miss Agnes hesitated. Erin had chosen one of the most popular breakfasts for today—mainly because it was a new form of cooking. It certainly brought in customers, but it was a very work-intensive meal for the staff to serve, as customers would regularly order second or even third helpings.</p>
<p>“Oh. Well, Maran isn’t here today—”</p>
<p>“No problem! You and Jasi can help if Safry needs it. That’s why she’s here, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“I—well—”</p>
<p>Erin walked into the kitchen. There she deliberately cooked the best crepes she could and made sure the <em>sizzle</em> and smell of cooking bacon would wake up even the most reluctant sleeper. She derived no small amount of pleasure from making Agnes’ inn the most profitable and busy building in the city that morning, and felt not a bit bad as Agnes, Safry, and Jasi hurried to fill orders.</p>
<p>It was all about food. Food was one of the things that was popular in any world. Erin reflected on that as she flipped a crepe into the air and onto a plate. She put it aside to cool, and then changed her mind and speared a piece of it with a fork and popped it into her mouth, ignoring the heat. Breakfast for Erin was usually in the middle of her cooking process.</p>
<p>“Five more crepes, Miss Erin!”</p>
<p>Safry poked her head into the kitchen, looking distressed. Erin could hear the voices in the common room, lots of them.</p>
<p>“Coming up!”</p>
<p>She poured and flipped, barely paying attention to what she was doing. Crepes. Now, weren’t crepes interesting?</p>
<p>The people of this world knew about pancakes, but crepes were new to them. But why did they pull in huge crowds even a week after Erin had introduced them to Celum? The answer was simple: they were new.</p>
<p>Yes, crepes had all the ingredients of a pancake except for baking powder. But it was what you did with the crepes—folding them and pouring syrup over them, or filling them with whipped cream or other savory and sweet things that made them so special. In that way, an old thing seemed practically brand new, and people flocked to the Frenzied Hare to try this wonderful food Erin made.</p>
<p>By now, Erin knew other inns and restaurants across the city were copying her recipe. It was human nature—and Drake and Gnoll nature as well. In time, she knew crepes would lose their hold over the stomachs of people and they’d just become one more item in a menu. But right now they were hot.</p>
<p>“Literally. Safry! Crepes are done!”</p>
<p>Because they were new. Erin let Safry take the plates as she placed some bacon on a plate next to eggs. People liked new things. Like her hamburgers. When they first came to Liscor, it was like they were the greatest food in the world. Because no one had tried them before. As soon as everyone started copying her recipe, hamburgers became, well, hamburgers. Some people loved them and they were tasty, but no one was lining up for them.</p>
<p>But new food was fun. That was the point. New <em>things</em> were fun. Erin remembered the impromptu concert she’d held outside her inn and smiled. Music from her world was so new and amazing to the citizens of Liscor she’d pulled in the gold coins with a rake.</p>
<p>Because it was new. Because it wasn’t stale and mundane and boring. That was the key. Erin still remembered her despondency from yesterday—in truth, it was still bugging her a bit, although the Jasi and Grev situation had distracted her. Music and food were two things people in this world could appreciate, same as in Erin’s. But—</p>
<p>It wasn’t enough. It still wasn’t enough. Erin could see someone like Agnes listening to the latest hot song of the year being played on the lute—or delighting over some new recipe and selling it at her inn. But was that all she’d ever do? Just stuff her face and listen to a new tune now and then?</p>
<p>No. That was so <em>boring </em>it hurt. There had to be more to life! People weren’t machines—Erin refused to believe that leveling up like machines every day and working without any fun was how this world should be.</p>
<p>That was why when she walked back out of the kitchen and saw that the inn had mostly cleared, Erin was determined to find Jasi a job that wouldn’t crush the Drake’s soul. She’d already accepted that Jasi wouldn’t be a [Barmaid]—at least not at Agnes’ inn. If the woman didn’t want her here, then that was that.</p>
<p>But Erin could always bring Jasi to Liscor. It wasn’t the best option, but Erin kept it as a reserve idea. She walked over to the exhausted Agnes, who’d taken a seat at the table to rest her legs, and smiled brightly.</p>
<p>“Alright! Breakfast’s done. Let’s find Jasi a cool class.”</p>
<p>Agnes only smiled weakly at Erin.</p>
<p>“Oh. Very good, dear.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How did one find a class? It was such an odd question to Erin—was it like getting a job in her world, or did someone just decide to become a [Thief] and start stealing things?</p>
<p>As it turned out, people in this world decided on classes in a very sensible manner. Once Miss Agnes had recovered, Erin found herself sitting at the table with her and Jasi as the older woman quizzed the Drake on her likes and dislikes.</p>
<p>“Do you sew? I should say—have you tried needlework? What about cooking? I hear your kind has a variety of…interesting treats.”</p>
<p>Likes, dislikes, and most importantly natural talent or aptitude went into choosing a class. Which made sense. No one wanted to be stuck with a class they were bad at, or one they hated. Jasi had taken the [Washer] class out of desperation, so Agnes and Erin’s job was to find something she’d like and be good at, and hopefully, earn enough to support herself and Grev with.</p>
<p>The problem was, Jasi didn’t seem to have any outstanding talents.</p>
<p>“I poke my scales more often than the cloth with needles. I would have sewn if I could—mending clothes earns a bit more coin than washing. But I couldn’t do it. The same goes for cooking—I can make a few things, but kneading dough is hard with claws.”</p>
<p>“Ooh. Yeah. That wouldn’t be so easy.”</p>
<p>Miss Agnes frowned slightly in vexation at Jasi, and partly at Erin. She was clearly irritable from having to play [Barmaid] so early.</p>
<p>“Have you ever thought about a combat class, dear? I know that’s a long shot, but…”</p>
<p>“I hate fighting.”</p>
<p>Jasi shook her head immediately, shuddering at the thought. Agnes nodded.</p>
<p>“Well, those classes are out, then.”</p>
<p>The older woman sighed. Jasi looked anxiously at her and Erin.</p>
<p>“I really don’t mind trying to learn to sew or cook. Or—I thought I could even learn a class like [Butcher] or [Receptionist]. I’m not picky. I’d try anything if I had the chance.”</p>
<p>“That’s the spirit!”</p>
<p>Agnes immediately brightened up at Jasi’s words.</p>
<p>“We could try you out in all of those professions. I have friends in various classes—it wouldn’t be too hard to talk them into giving you an apprenticeship. Why, in a day or two you’d probably find something you really shine at.”</p>
<p>Jasi nodded obediently, looking grateful for the opportunity, but Erin frowned.</p>
<p>“Willing doesn’t mean she <em>likes</em> it, Miss Agnes. Jasi should find a job—a class that suits her.”</p>
<p>“Yes, well, we don’t all know what we’ll be good at.”</p>
<p>Agnes smiled blandly at Erin. There was definitely a current of tension running between the two [Innkeepers] now, or so Erin felt. No—she wasn’t imagining it. She was annoyed at Agnes, and the same held true of the other woman. They were clashing over the issue of Jasi, and it was making Erin uncharacteristically upset.</p>
<p>“I think a few days of feeling things out would do young Jasi some good, Erin.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“It helped me. I didn’t know I’d be an [Innkeeper] when I was young. But when I met Jerom, well, things have a way of working themselves out. We don’t all get to choose what class we level in, now do we? You told me you earned your [Innkeeper] class by accident as well. Maybe Jasi will find her class as she tries things out.”</p>
<p>Erin narrowed her eyes. Being an [Innkeeper] certainly hadn’t been her choice, but she’d been forced into it out of the need to survive, and because she’d liked it.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I think we should consider more classes. There are tons more than just…those ones you mentioned.”</p>
<p>Miss Agnes lost her smile. She sounded exasperated as she spread her hands out on the table.</p>
<p>“The girl—the Drake—doesn’t have any particular skills, Erin. Why not let her work a few odd jobs? She seemed to be doing well for herself as a [Washer] before you came along.”</p>
<p>Jasi shrunk back in her seat, but Erin didn’t bat an eye at the criticism.</p>
<p>“If you mean she was alive, yeah, she was. But I had to buy a healing potion for her hands. That’s not doing okay, Miss Agnes.”</p>
<p>The woman wavered. She glanced around the mostly empty room and realized their argument had attracted a few casual eyes. Safry immediately turned and started bussing a few more tables. Miss Agnes eyed the new customers and changed the subject.</p>
<p>“We’ve got more customers, I see.”</p>
<p>“So we do.”</p>
<p>Erin folded her arms. Miss Agnes waffled on, glancing meaningfully at Erin.</p>
<p>“Late morning breakfasters, I’ll warrant. There’s always one or two…a good [Innkeeper] prepares for them, but I suppose it <em>was</em> quite a crowd that came in this morning. But here we are, and I know they’re hungry. It would be a shame to turn them away, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>A scowl was the only reply she got. Erin sat in her chair, unwilling to move. She glanced at the customers, and then smiled.</p>
<p>“Why don’t <em>you</em> cook for them?”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>Agnes blinked.</p>
<p>“But I—well, I don’t have any Skills in cooking like you do, Erin dear.”</p>
<p>“But this <em>is</em> your inn. And I’m tired. So—you cook. Or you could turn them away. But I think I’m going to help Jasi some more.”</p>
<p>So saying, Erin turned her back on Agnes and looked at Jasi. After a few seconds she heard Agnes walk briskly away.</p>
<p>“Safry! Ask our customers what they’d like to eat.”</p>
<p>Erin smiled at Jasi, who looked somewhat pale.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be a bother, Miss Erin, I really don’t. I’d be more than happy to apprentice at any job for a while. If I got a few levels—why, I’d probably be able to make do from there.”</p>
<p>The young woman sitting across from her smiled and shook her head slowly.</p>
<p>“That’s true. But I want to find something that <em>you</em> like to do, not something that you have to do. Agnes is wrong. You should try and find something you want to do.”</p>
<p>Jasi paused.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Miss Erin.”</p>
<p>For the first time this morning, Erin gave her a genuine smile.</p>
<p>“Call me Erin. Just Erin. Now, have you ever tried running around? I have a friend who does that all the time, and she says the pay is good…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An hour later, Erin had to admit that perhaps Jasi <em>didn’t</em> have any particular class that seemed to suit her. At least, not one that could be easily discerned. She and Jasi had gone through a huge list of classes, hindered by Miss Agnes’ occasional comment, but Jasi either hadn’t tried the class before or didn’t feel inclined to try it.</p>
<p>Some jobs the Drake could tell weren’t for her. [Farmer], [Soldier], [Thief]…those were easy. Others might have been likely, but they were impossible to tell, like [Guardswoman]. How would you even tell? Jasi had never lifted a sword before. And she hadn’t had a chance to try out any of the other professions in the city.</p>
<p>She’d been poor all her life. And that, Erin was quickly discovering, was a limiting factor.</p>
<p>Despondently, Erin slumped over at her table, staring at Jasi’s helpless expression. The inn was mostly empty. Agnes’ cooking had a way of driving away even fairly hungry patrons, and besides, it was that time of day when inns didn’t really matter, in between breakfast and lunch. If people wanted a snack they’d find a stall outside. And few people were drinking this early in the day.</p>
<p>Erin could use a drink. She hadn’t known how <em>hard</em> this would be. Well, she had—but knowing wasn’t the same as experiencing it. She felt like she was hitting her head against an invisible brick wall, but she had no idea how to stop running into it.</p>
<p>“I dunno. I guess we could do the internship-apprentice thing, but that’s so <em>slow.</em> Are you sure you don’t want to try being an [Alchemist]? I could go bother Octavia right now if you want.”</p>
<p>“That’s one thing I <em>am</em> sure about, Miss. [Alchemists] are far too strange for me. I don’t want to melt my tail off or—or grow mushrooms out of my eyes.”</p>
<p>Jasi shuddered at the thought. Erin sighed and then cast her eyes around the inn.</p>
<p>“What do you think, Wesle? Would Jasi be a good [Guardswoman]?”</p>
<p>Wesle looked up guiltily as he tucked into a crepe Erin had made. He straightened up in his chair, glancing at the door.</p>
<p>“I ah, don’t know, Erin. Guarding isn’t as hard here as it is in a Drake city, it’s true, but we do require all our recruits to be able to use a sword. Plus, there’s always a bit of fighting when we have to quiet drunks. If Miss Jasi was assigned to gatekeeping duty I could see her doing well—but even then, she’d have to help fight whenever a monster attacked.”</p>
<p>Erin nodded gloomily.</p>
<p>“Thought so. How’s the crepe?”</p>
<p>“Oh, wonderful, Miss Erin.”</p>
<p>Wesle blushed a bit.</p>
<p>“I’m very grateful. But ah, I <em>am </em>on duty. I’d better just eat this quickly and go.”</p>
<p>“Mm. Thanks for bringing Grev here.”</p>
<p>Erin turned her head and regarded the nervous young boy sitting at a table with a crepe of his own. Wesle had brought Grev into the Frenzied Hare about an hour after breakfast had ended. Now the [Guardsman] looked over at Grev sternly, giving him a hard look.</p>
<p>“I hardly believed him when he said he lived here, Miss Erin. But he kept insisting that you’d given him and his…sister a place here.”</p>
<p>“Well, he was telling the truth. Which is sorta rare for him, I guess.”</p>
<p>Grev hunched over in his seat. He’d been caught by Wesle for lingering a bit too near a shopkeeper’s outdoor stall. Now he sat with the disapproving eyes of Jasi, Erin, and Wesle on him, clearly wishing he could be anywhere else.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry about that, sir.”</p>
<p>Jasi was as apologetic as she’d been with Erin, and clearly unable to do anything to stop Grev. She was a big sister, not a mother, and she was even more nervous now that Grev had clearly not learned his lesson from yesterday.</p>
<p>Wesle nodded to her, trying to look dignified and failing to with bits of crepe on his weak mustache.</p>
<p>“I’ll overlook this today, but you should know your brother is on the thinnest of ice, Miss Jasi. If he keeps sneaking off again—”</p>
<p>Safry was passing by Erin with a used plate and utensils. Erin snatched the plate out of her hands and hurled one of the utensils in one motion. The spoon passed by Grev’s nose and bounced off one wall. He shouted in surprise and alarm, freezing as he tried to edge towards the door.</p>
<p>“<em>Sit down.</em>”</p>
<p>Erin’s glare magically sent Grev’s bottom back in the chair. He trembled as she waved the fork at him.</p>
<p>“You’ve caused enough trouble for your sister. Try and run off and I’ll throw the plate at you next time. And if that doesn’t work, I’ll take this fork and shove it—”</p>
<p>Erin paused. She glanced at Safry and Miss Agnes, both of whom were watching her with gaping mouths.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Wesle coughed delicately.</p>
<p>“Was that [Unerring Throw], Miss Erin? It’s rare to see an [Innkeeper] with a combat Skill like that.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Erin just shrugged. She had a lot of odd Skills, or so she’d gathered. Probably because she’d actually had to fight for her life. They weren’t that useful in day-to-day life, but they were certainly handy when she wanted to terrorize young boys.</p>
<p>“Where were we? Oh yeah. Jasi’s class. Um…”</p>
<p>Erin sighed. Then she looked at Grev. He stared at her, white-faced.</p>
<p>“What about him? Can’t Grev get a class instead of running around and stealing things?”</p>
<p>Agnes snorted. She’d kept out of the discussion, but she eyed Grev skeptically now.</p>
<p>“The boy’s at the right age to be apprenticed to someone. But with his past misdeeds—I doubt anyone would want to take a risk on him. I’d advise Miss Jasi to say her goodbyes while she can—if the young thief hasn’t changed his ways after so many warnings, he won’t now.”</p>
<p>Jasi’s scales turned pale and Grev looked palely down at his empty plate. Erin glared at Miss Agnes.</p>
<p>“Don’t you have anything you can do, Miss Agnes?”</p>
<p>“Not at the moment, Miss Erin. I have no customers, as you may have noticed.”</p>
<p>“Then why don’t you leave your inn to me for a while?”</p>
<p>The woman paused.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I said, why don’t you leave? I’m perfectly capable of managing it, and I think you could use a break.”</p>
<p>“But I—this is <em>my </em>inn.”</p>
<p>Erin raised an eyebrow. She was royally annoyed with Miss Agnes’ attitude. How could she be so uncaring? So Erin took a page out of Ryoka’s book of meanness.</p>
<p>“It’s your inn, but I’m a better [Innkeeper]. You can take a break and leave things to me. You and Safry, for that matter.”</p>
<p>Both women gaped at Erin. But the young woman just flapped her hands at them.</p>
<p>“Shoo, shoo.”</p>
<p>Miss Agnes was staring hard at Erin, but she <em>was</em> the lower-level [Innkeeper], and Erin had stared down far more frightening things than a middle-aged woman with empathy issues. In the end, Miss Agnes haughtily adjusted her dress, not meeting Erin’s stare.</p>
<p>“I—suppose I could use some time to relax. Very well. Safry, you have the day off.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Agnes.”</p>
<p>“I believe I’ll…go shopping. I’m sure Jerom would love a new decoration. Yes, I’ll do that. Thank you, Miss Erin.”</p>
<p>She walked out of the inn. Safry hesitated, and then followed her as Erin stared at her.</p>
<p>“Mnn.”</p>
<p>Erin stuck out her tongue after Miss Agnes and Safry had left. She felt bad but not-bad at the same time. It was the first time she’d ever been so mean to them, but—they’d been real jerks!</p>
<p>She turned and saw Wesle staring at her with a piece of crepe dangling from a fork. Jasi and Grev were also giving her fish-eyes.</p>
<p>“What? They were being rude.”</p>
<p>Jasi gulped. She looked at the door Miss Agnes hadn’t even bothered to fully close and shook her head, her scales pale around her face. She looked at Erin, mystified and gratified and upset.</p>
<p>“You’re being so kind to us, Mis—Erin. Too kind. I don’t know why you’re going so far for people like Grev and me.”</p>
<p>“It’s because I can.”</p>
<p>The smile Erin gave her was just that. A smile. But it made the Drake cry, and prompted Wesle to offer her a handkerchief. Grev sat in his chair, looking upset and confused, but soon enough Erin had another crepe in front of everyone, and a slightly alcoholic drink for the adults and milk for Grev. She sat down and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s try again. Properly this time. Jasi needs a new job. Not necessarily a class. Grev needs to stop stealing, and Wesle probably needs to get back to work, but he’s helping us. How can we make things right?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best idea they’d had was for Erin to sponsor Jasi as an apprentice at a bunch of different jobs. Erin put her head in her hands and groaned.</p>
<p>“I wish Ryoka were here.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“She’d know what to do. She’s got lots of ideas.”</p>
<p>Wesle looked confused. He was sitting at the table with Erin and Jasi while Grev practiced the art of trying not to puke. Erin’s solution to his restlessness had been to feed him to the point of bursting. Now he was sitting at his table, unable to even finish his last bite of hash browns drizzled with cheese.</p>
<p>Jasi was staring at the half-empty mug in her hands. She’d been growing more and more quietly depressed throughout the discussion. Now she looked up, confused.</p>
<p>“Who’s Ryoka?”</p>
<p>“A City Runner. She’s my friend.”</p>
<p>“And how could she help? I’ve seen Miss Ryoka come into the city quite often, but I don’t see how she’d help here. She seemed rather—quiet every time I tried to talk to her.”</p>
<p>Erin shook her head at Wesle.</p>
<p>“I know she’s a jerk sometimes. But she’s smart. And she studied a lot of weird stuff in school. Did you know she told me that we could probably build a greenhouse right next to my inn? She said we don’t even need any glass to make it, which is really weird, right? I was going to ask Klbkch about it, but then I ended up here.”</p>
<p>Almost none of what Erin had said made sense to either Wesle or Jasi. They just blinked at her, confused. She sighed.</p>
<p>“Never mind. Are there any classes we haven’t considered?”</p>
<p>“None, Miss.”</p>
<p>Jasi looked gloomy.</p>
<p>“I really do appreciate you helping, I do. But I don’t think I have any special talents. I’d be happy with a steady job, I really would.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but that’s so…”</p>
<p>The [Innkeeper]’s voice trailed off helplessly in the face of Jasi’s resignation. They’d tossed out every class they could think of, but none had seemed right for Jasi. But there were plenty of ‘possible’ options and ‘okay’ options. But nothing felt <em>right</em>.</p>
<p>In truth, it was Erin who was truly dissatisfied with Jasi and Grev’s opportunities. [Seamstress]? [Barber]? [Cook]? [Blacksmith]? All these jobs sounded…boring. Erin knew they were all important jobs that someone had to do, but if she had a choice, those would be far from her first ones.</p>
<p>At least [Runner] sounded marginally interesting. But—hadn’t Ryoka told Erin how much it sucked to be a Street Runner? And Erin was sure the other girl had complained at length about running countless miles to deliver some useless item for only a few silver coins. Unless you were a Courier, being a Runner sounded sort of boring too.</p>
<p>There it was again. Boring. Erin kept thinking the word. She sighed loudly again.</p>
<p>“I just don’t—I know we could find you a decent job, Jasi. But that’s not what you should want, y’know?”</p>
<p>Jasi exchanged a glance with Wesle.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Miss Erin. What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Erin didn’t really know herself. She tried to explain as she slumped lower in her seat.</p>
<p>“It’s just…we’re talking about your future here. And you’re happy to get an okay job, I get that. But—don’t you want to be rich or famous? Don’t you have anything you want to do, anything special?”</p>
<p>She looked hopefully at Jasi, but just got a confused shake of the head in return.</p>
<p>“All I’ve ever wanted was to keep myself fed and clothed, Miss Erin. That’s all.”</p>
<p>The Drake had no idea how depressed that made Erin. How could she <em>not</em> want to do something special? But Jasi had been poor. Her dreams were real and urgent.</p>
<p>“You never wanted to be famous? Or live an exciting life?”</p>
<p>When she’d been younger, Erin had dreamed of being a astronaut. Then, when she’d been slightly older she’d wanted to be a legendary chess player, someone who could beat even a computer in chess. And then…she’d wanted to be a chess commentator, someone with a huge following or even a YouTube channel. Her dreams weren’t huge, true—most people didn’t even know chess commentary was an actual job. But they were big to Erin.</p>
<p>Jasi didn’t even have her own hopes and dreams. Erin looked at Grev.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to be someone special?”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>The young boy looked confused and slightly scared as Erin pointed at him. She nodded.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you. If you could have any class—do anything—what would you do?”</p>
<p>“I’d—I’d be a famous adventurer! A Gold-rank—no, a Named Adventurer! And I’d have a flaming sword and slay Dragons.”</p>
<p>Grev’s face immediately lit up, but Jasi only shook her head, looking upset.</p>
<p>“Please, Miss Erin. Don’t encourage Grev.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>Erin glared at Jasi, making the Drake shrink back.</p>
<p>“Dreams are good! Important! If you could do anything, what would you do, Jasi?”</p>
<p>The Drake hesitated, and bit at her lip. Reluctantly, she replied.</p>
<p>“I suppose if I could I’d like to learn a craft and start a small business for myself—but even that’s a far-off dream, Miss Erin.”</p>
<p>She didn’t quite deserve the dead gaze Erin gave her. Jasi just shrugged helplessly.</p>
<p>“It’s all I can think of. If I could have anything—I guess I’d wish to be rich? Rich enough that I never have to work?”</p>
<p>“Really? That’s boring too!”</p>
<p>Erin threw her hands up helplessly. Why were Jasi’s ambitions so <em>small?</em> Why was she so upset? But it was just—</p>
<p>Boring. The same word again.</p>
<p>“Wesle!”</p>
<p>The man jumped.</p>
<p>“Yes, Erin?”</p>
<p>“What’s your dream?”</p>
<p>He hesitated and turned slightly red. But the look in Erin’s eyes didn’t give him any wiggle room. Clearing his throat several times, Wesle blushingly replied.</p>
<p>“I wanted to be an adventurer too. But—”</p>
<p>His hand fell back on his sword hilt helplessly. Wesle squeezed his eyes for a second.</p>
<p>“—But I’m afraid I can’t be one. I’m not a born fighter like they are, Miss Erin. I can handle myself, but I’m not brave enough to go searching for evil to fight.”</p>
<p>Wesle closed his eyes. He stared past Erin, at something in the distance. His voice softened, and his hand clenched around the mug on this table.</p>
<p>“If I could, I should have liked to have been a [Knight]. I would have loved to fight monsters and defend people by slaying creatures. And—yes, wielding a flaming sword. Or one that can cut through steel, at least.”</p>
<p>His eyes refocused, and he coughed, turning beet-red. He looked afraid, as if he was sure the others in the room would laugh at him. But no one did.</p>
<p>Instead, his words made Jasi take a breath. She stared out the window, hesitating, and then spoke.</p>
<p>“If I could? If I had nothing to worry about? Maybe, maybe I’d travel to Liscor. To other cities. I’d like to know what Drakes—my people are like. I’d like to see what lies beyond Celum’s walls.”</p>
<p>She’d never left the city? But there were people like that too. Even back home, Erin remembered people, old people, who’d never even left their home state. They’d never flown on a plane or bothered to drive more than a hundred miles from where they were born and would die. She’d never understood that, but then, Erin had travelled to other continents to play chess in tournaments when she was young.</p>
<p>Some days, it felt like Erin really was in a different world. Only, she was walking among aliens that wore human faces. She met people with small dreams, who were as small as insects. Sometimes. But then Erin looked deep into their souls and saw something familiar. Something she’d seen in a mirror when she was young.</p>
<p>Hope. Dreams.</p>
<p>Passion.</p>
<p>The man and Drake sitting at her table were very different, but they had the same look in their eyes. It wasn’t what Erin saw in Agnes’ pitying gaze, or Safry’s shrug. There was still something in Wesle’s expression, and Jasi’s eyes when she stared at the window. They had a spark there, of something real and <em>alive</em>. But it was fading, and Erin saw it flickering in Jasi’s resigned smile and the way Wesle shook his head when he talked about his past dreams.</p>
<p>They had hopes. They had ambitions. But it was buried so deep that they’d nearly forgotten about them. Erin touched her aching chest. And yet, what could you do? Octavia’s words echoed in her mind. If you weren’t willing to risk everything, what could you do?</p>
<p>Being an adventurer was a calling for the few, the insane and the brave and the desperate. But what else could people do if they didn’t want to work their entire lives? Octavia was right. There was no other way to live. Either you took a risk and died or became famous or—you worked hard and kept your head down.</p>
<p>“It’s not right.”</p>
<p>That was all Erin said. She sat at the table and clenched her hands. This wasn’t right. This was how the world was—how this world was. And she knew it was probably how the world had been, back in her world for thousands of years. But—</p>
<p>It wasn’t right. There was more to life. She knew that. She lived, she had lived in a world where anyone could be anything. That was what she’d been taught as a child. And maybe it wasn’t totally true, but it was that idea which people associated with her home country, with being an American. It was about equality, but it was also about hope.</p>
<p>Hope, and the faith that you could realize your dreams.</p>
<p>“Miss Erin?”</p>
<p>Erin looked up. Jasi and Wesle were looking at her. So was Grev.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You’ve been very quiet. Are you alright?”</p>
<p>“I am. It’s just—your world—your city—sort of sucks, guys.”</p>
<p>To Erin’s surprise, both Jasi and Wesle immediately frowned at her comment.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if that’s true.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Celum isn’t perfect but—it’s just as good as Liscor.”</p>
<p>“Respectfully, Miss Erin, Celum is quite a good city to live in.”</p>
<p>Erin blinked at the force of their replies. Even Jasi was defending Celum. Why? Wesle’s normally amiable face looked quite upset as he stared challengingly at Erin.</p>
<p>“What makes you feel your home is that much better than Celum?”</p>
<p>“Where I come from—in the place where I used to be, people didn’t have so—so few options.”</p>
<p>Erin tried to explain to the indignant guardsman and Drake.</p>
<p>“We have plenty of options!”</p>
<p>“Indeed. Anyone can make something of themselves in Celum.”</p>
<p>“No—no, you guys don’t get it! Here you can only have boring jobs. Or—or be an adventurer and maybe die. But back home, people could be someone. They could be stars, celebrities!”</p>
<p>“Celebrities?”</p>
<p>The word was completely foreign to the two. Erin nodded energetically, suddenly able to put words to the sense of absence she’d been feeling recently.</p>
<p>“Yeah! Back home—even a girl or guy from a far off village could go to the big city and make their dreams come true. It was hard and risky, but they could take a chance. They could try and fulfill their dreams! If you wanted to, you could go there.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>The word came out of Erin’s childhood.</p>
<p>“Hollywood.”</p>
<p>The word burned in the silence. And suddenly, Erin remembered. She remembered movies and dreams and childhood. Yes, how could she have forgotten? But Wesle and Jasi didn’t get it. They just looked confused.</p>
<p>“What’s that? Some kind of tree?”</p>
<p>How could you explain Hollywood to people who hadn’t even seen a movie? Erin grabbed at words and failed to find anything that would help. Hollywood was—it was movies! It was the silver screen, the place where hopes and stories became reality. Now things were different of course—there was Youtube and the internet. And you heard all kinds of bad things about Hollywood. Sexism, racism, jerkism…</p>
<p>But when Erin had been small, Hollywood had been the place where magic was made in her world. It had been the place where movies came from, a wondrous, far-off land. But how to describe it?</p>
<p>“<em>Broadway!</em> Plays! That’s what it’s like!”</p>
<p>Wesle’s chair scooted back as Erin suddenly shouted. Yes, that was it! She turned excitedly to the scared Drake and human.</p>
<p>“Haven’t you seen a play before? Hollywood is like a play except—better!”</p>
<p>Erin stared hopefully at the other two. They had to have seen a play before. That was—even in this world, they’d be common, right? Right? But her jaw dropped as the two shook their head slowly.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I’ve never seen one, Miss Solstice.”</p>
<p>“Neither have I.”</p>
<p>“<em>What?</em>”</p>
<p>The bug-eyed stare Erin was giving them made Jasi and Wesle feel uncomfortable. The guardsman cleared his throat nervously.</p>
<p>“If you mean a tumbling routine—I always catch those every time a festival happens. And of course I like to listen to stories in taverns if there’s a [Storyteller] travelling by.”</p>
<p>“I like to read books. We had one when I was young. It was worn, but—”</p>
<p>“<em>No!</em>”</p>
<p>Erin put her hands underneath the table and <em>flipped </em>it<em>.</em> It was the only thing that she could do, the only thing that could give vent to her emotions. The mugs, the drinks, plates and silverware all went flying. Jasi screamed and Wesle cried out in shock. As pottery crashed and broke on the floor, there was silence.</p>
<p>And standing, trembling, pointing at them, Erin. She stood on her chair, practically vibrating with passion.</p>
<p>“No! That isn’t a play! Plays are more than stupid tumbling, more than just a book! They’re full of—of romance! Drama! Love! Action! Intrigue and betrayal and hope and—”</p>
<p>Erin waved her hands around wildly while Jasi, Wesle, and Grev all stared at her. Grev was already edging towards the stairs.</p>
<p>“You’re telling me none of you have <em>ever </em>seen a play before?”</p>
<p>“The table—”</p>
<p>Jasi squeaked as Erin rounded on her.</p>
<p>“No—no I haven’t!”</p>
<p>“Never? Why not?”</p>
<p>“There aren’t many people with that sort of class, Miss Erin! I mean, who would take a class like that on a whim? There are [Bards], Miss Erin. And—oh, maybe in large cities there are performances like that, but it’s not a job anyone can just learn.”</p>
<p>“What’s a play?”</p>
<p>Erin looked incredulously at Grev. But the boy had piped up, staring at Erin with curious eyes.</p>
<p>“You don’t know? It’s—it’s people telling a story. They pretend to be characters and they act out something funny or tragic. It’s like a book, but in real life!”</p>
<p>“Huh. Watch people pretend to be people in a story?”</p>
<p>Grev’s little nose wrinkled in disgust.</p>
<p>“Who’d want to see that?”</p>
<p>He flinched when Erin stared at him with wrath in her eyes. Wesle carefully raised a hand.</p>
<p>“I saw a performance like that once.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>He nodded, eyeing the broken plates and spilled drink on the ground.</p>
<p>“It was a wandering group of performers. They were telling everyone how a group of Gold-rank adventurers slew an entire nest of Griffons that had been preying on a town. It was a reenactment, and they had a fake Griffin creature they burned—”</p>
<p>“<em>That’s not it either!</em>”</p>
<p>Erin jumped off the chair and kicked it. She hopped around shouting in agony as Grev hid under the table. Jasi was petrified and Wesle had a hand on his sword as if he feared he’d had to defend himself.</p>
<p>“That’s not it at all!”</p>
<p>When Erin had calmed down a bit, she tried again. She couldn’t believe they didn’t know. She had to tell them. The knowledge was burning a hole in her chest, trying to get out.</p>
<p>“Plays are—more than just reenactments, Wesle. They’re a story, a moment. If they’re boring they’re good—they should make you laugh and cry and <em>believe</em> what you’re seeing is real. Some of the most famous characters in history came from plays!”</p>
<p>“Like who?”</p>
<p>Erin didn’t have to think.</p>
<p>“Romeo and Juliet.”</p>
<p>“Who? I mean, what did they do?”</p>
<p>Jasi stared at Erin. Erin stared back. And then the girl leapt onto a table.</p>
<p>“<em>O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?</em> Who doesn’t know of the star-crossed lovers? Romeo of House Montague and Juliet of House Capulet! They, the two forbidden scions of each house dare the wrath of their families to find romance. Even if it means death, they would be together. At any cost.”</p>
<p>Jasi’s sharp teeth glinted as she gaped up at Erin. Wesle’s lips were parted in surprise. Erin bowed to them, flourishing on the table as if she were on stage.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“Two households, both alike in dignity,</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.”</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>She stared down at the staring faces, full of anger and emotion.</p>
<p><em>“That </em>is the story of Romeo and Juliet.”</p>
<p>Only slack faces greeted Erin. She blinked, realized what had happened.</p>
<p>“Whoa. Did I do that?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How <em>did</em> she do that? As Erin helped right the table and clean up the mess—the others were too shaken to do more than sit—she wondered what had happened.</p>
<p>She was no actor. Erin wasn’t even that good at acting. But in that moment, she’d perfectly recalled the opening lines of Romeo and Juliet, word for word! How? She didn’t have a perfect memory—she’d never even read the play! She’d just seen it performed once!</p>
<p>But wait a minute. Erin frowned as she mopped up the spilled drink and got rid of the broken pottery in a few seconds of brisk cleaning. She had Skills, didn’t she? Not just [Advanced Cleaning].</p>
<p>She was a Level 6 [Singer]. And she had that skill—[Perfect Recall]. It didn’t actually let Erin remember everything, it only worked for songs. Songs…and plays as it turned out. Yes, now that Erin concentrated, she found it was true! She could remember plays, entire passages out of books—anything that Erin considered artistic, really.</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard anything like it.”</p>
<p>That was what Wesle kept repeating when Erin was done with cleaning up her accident. He sat at a table, staring at Erin.</p>
<p>“What strange way of speaking was that? It sounded grand and yet—it rhymed. I’ve never heard anything like it.”</p>
<p>Erin sat at another table, trying to explain. Now she had all the attention on the room on her—not just attention, but fierce interest. It was like the crepes, like the new music all over again. Erin felt it. Here was something new, and it captivated the people of this world.</p>
<p>“That’s a play. Some of them rhyme. It’s called iambic pentameter.”</p>
<p>“And what’s that? Iambic…? Is it a Skill?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s a way of speaking. Anyone can do it. It’s—well, it’s just a style. But it sounds good, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>“It does.”</p>
<p>Both Jasi and Wesle nodded in agreement. Erin smiled.</p>
<p>“That’s a play. Actually, that’s not even it. What I just said, I’d say to the crowd before the actual play started. To understand a real play—you’d have to see it done with multiple actors on stage.”</p>
<p>“I wish I could see that. It sounds—interesting.”</p>
<p>Erin wished she could see that too. To see a movie, or a play—even one of the classics from her world like The Wizard of Oz would be…</p>
<p>Impossible. She sighed. But then Erin sat up. She stared at the female Drake sitting in front of her, eyes alight with interest, and the human male sitting next to her, fuzzy lipped and full of life.</p>
<p>And Erin had an obvious idea. She smiled widely, and looked at the two while Grev peeked at her from the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Well, why not? Would you two like to put on a play by yourselves?”</p>
<p>“Us?”</p>
<p>The two exchanged a glance. But Erin knew that they would say ‘yes’ before they even nodded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a play. A new thing for this world, or maybe an ordinary thing made new. It was supposed to be grand and special. But—as Erin sat at her table, she realized that recreating a play wasn’t exactly the same as making crepes or playing a song on an iPhone.</p>
<p>What did she have? She had a perfect recall of the play Romeo and Juliet. That was a plus. And she had three willing people who wanted to experience a play. Another big plus. And they even had a place to practice. All of this should theoretically translate into a play.</p>
<p>But they’d hit upon a problem. And it was a rather big one. Wesle sighed as he pointed his sword at Grev from the center of the room. Grev held the scabbard in his hands, pretending it was a sword of his own. Both looked awkward, and were visibly hesitating.</p>
<p>“Don’t hesitate! Just say your lines!”</p>
<p>Erin called out to them from her director’s seat. She’d pushed back all the tables to the walls to give them room to perform in, and she was sitting with Jasi at a table. But the two actors still looked uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I understand how it should go.”</p>
<p>“I explained it to you. Just give it a shot!”</p>
<p>Erin called out encouragingly to Wesle as he hesitated. He frowned, nodding and mouthing his lines silently. Grev held his scabbard up, doing the same thing.</p>
<p>They were reenacting a fight scene between Romeo and Paris, because Grev had wanted to try acting as well. Of course, Paris wasn’t supposed to be a little boy, but it was as close as Erin could do. And it was a dramatic scene! They were fighting right before Paris was slain and Romeo killed himself. It should have been a powerful moment that needed no direction.</p>
<p>But—</p>
<p>But Erin had begun to realize the error in using Romeo and Juliet as her introduction to plays. It hadn’t seemed like a mistake before, but it was becoming more and more obvious to her as time wore on.</p>
<p>At first glance, Shakespeare made sense. He was a famous guy—his works were classic! And yet—Erin had to admit, the language the famous Bard of Avalon used was…difficult at best.</p>
<p>“Go for it, Grev!”</p>
<p>“Okay!”</p>
<p>The boy spoke awkwardly, trying to force the lines of iambic pentameter into natural cadence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.”</p>
<p>He pointed his scabbard at Wesle. The man took a step back and took a deep breath. Wesle cleared his throat and began reciting Romeo’s lines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“I must indeed, and therefore came I hither.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth—I say, isn’t this rather long?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Erin groaned and beside her, Jasi covered her face.</p>
<p>“Even if it’s long, say the lines! You’re supposed to!”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I can’t remember them all!”</p>
<p>Grev sighed and lowered his tired arm as Wesle walked over to consult with Erin. She sighed too. This wasn’t working.</p>
<p>Romeo and Juliet. A timeless play, or so the critics said. Except that time was dragging on here and everyone was clearly growing more and more tired of the play as they fumbled on.</p>
<p>Erin blamed Shakespeare, or more accurately, his dialogue. It was impressive, yes. A woven script filled with a craftsman’s trickery with words. Even more impressive, it was in iambic pentameter, making each meter and verse doubly significant.</p>
<p>And that was the problem. It was <em>dense</em>. Now that Erin was recalling the full script, she realized how complex it was! Soliloquies, monologues, clever asides and tricks of dialogue…not to mention all the side characters!</p>
<p>For an audience who liked wit and humor, for an audience of Shakespeare’s time, it was great stuff, Erin had no doubt. But it wasn’t a story that captivated her heart—or her reluctant actor’s.</p>
<p>“Try again. You’re supposed to be enraged, in the middle of passion!”</p>
<p>“I can barely remember what to say.”</p>
<p>Wesle groaned. He tried again.</p>
<p>“Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man!”</p>
<p>Erin shook her head.</p>
<p>“No, no. It’s too awkward. You sound like you’re just reciting the words, not <em>acting.</em>”</p>
<p>“Well—”</p>
<p>Wesle threw up his hands, out of words. He stalked over to Grev and snatched his scabbard back. Erin ruffled her hair.</p>
<p>“Argh. Maybe—let’s try a Romeo and Juliet scene. I went over the play with you guys—you <em>know</em> how important their meeting on the balcony is. Let’s do that.”</p>
<p>Jasi nodded and stood up. Reluctantly, Wesle walked over to the other side of the room, and bowed his head.</p>
<p>He wasn’t liking this. That made Erin concerned. She went over to him.</p>
<p>“Hey. Are you not enjoying it?”</p>
<p>“I—don’t know, Miss Solstice. I don’t.”</p>
<p>Wesle just shrugged, looking both annoyed and disheartened.</p>
<p>“When you spoke the lines of the play I got chills, I truly did. But trying to make it into an actual play, to act it out—it’s a different thing entirely.”</p>
<p>Erin nodded. Her audience had listened to her go quickly through the entire play of Romeo and Juliet, drinking in the story like sponges. They’d even memorized entire lines of the play by rote—something Erin had thought was impossible! Apparently when you didn’t have a computer or iPhone handy, your ability to remember things you’d heard was a lot better.</p>
<p>They’d liked the play. But they didn’t like acting. Or rather, Wesle didn’t. Grev liked the mock swordfight and he’d hit Wesle several times with the scabbard, and Jasi had liked playing Juliet. But it was just play-acting, not the real thing.</p>
<p>Erin thought Wesle was trying for the real thing, but he couldn’t figure it out. She’d tried to show him, but acting wasn’t something he’d ever witnessed. All she could give him was her advice, and she had very little of that.</p>
<p>“Just do your best.”</p>
<p>“I <em>am.</em>”</p>
<p>Wesle clenched his fists as Jasi murmured her lines and practiced looking elegant. She really did seem to love the idea of the role.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Is it that you can’t figure out how to move?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s—I know it sounds silly, Erin, but I’m just not Romeo. I can’t be this grand hero in love. I’m just—Wesle. Just a [Guardsman], not a young [Lord].”</p>
<p>Wesle’s shoulders slumped. Erin looked at him, and understood a bit. She touched his shoulder and pulled him around.</p>
<p>“I know you’re not Romeo. But no one’s Romeo when they play him, Wesle. They become him.”</p>
<p>He looked at her, frustrated, helpless.</p>
<p>“<em>How?</em>”</p>
<p>Erin hesitated. She looked at Jasi, who was watching her anxiously, and at Grev. How could she explain acting to people who lived such small lives? Who didn’t have dreams? Who were beaten down by this stupid world and system they lived under?</p>
<p>Well…how else? Erin suddenly knew what to say. She looked back as Wesle, looked him right in the eyes.</p>
<p>“Haven’t you ever—<em>ever</em> wanted to be someone else? To be someone you’re not?”</p>
<p>Wesle hesitated, opened his mouth. Closed it. Grimaced.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“Then that’s what you do. You don’t want to be someone else. For a little while, but a few moments—you <em>become </em>them. This is you, on stage, living out your dream.”</p>
<p>She pointed at Jasi, pointed at the stage, the empty bit of ground they’d cleared.</p>
<p>“This is your one chance. Forget about me, forget about the people watching you—you’re Romeo right now, a young nobleman who only has eyes for Juliet. You’re not Wesle. Wesle has a fuzzy mustache and he’s just a [Guardsman]. You’re Romeo. And you’re in love.”</p>
<p>Wesle stared at Erin, and she wondered if she’d failed. But then without a word he walked towards Jasi. The Drake was ready, and she called out even as Wesle strode towards her, back straight.</p>
<p>“What man art thou that thus bescreen’d in night so stumblest on my counsel?”</p>
<p>Wesle walked towards Jasi, and then knelt before her. Erin had thought that was appropriate for Romeo. He looked only a bit awkward as he stared up at Jasi imploringly. Still fake. But he was trying.</p>
<p>“By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am—”</p>
<p>Wesle stumbled over his words and bit his tongue. Erin winced. The language was just too hard! She was about to jump in, to tell him it was alright, when she saw something change.</p>
<p>The [Guardsman] kneeling in front of Jasi as the Drake tried to pretend she had a dress suddenly paused. He stopped, hesitated as he thought of his next lines, and then tossed away the script he had memorized. He rose, and took Jasi’s hand in his own. Startled, the Drake looked at him, but Wesle’s face was serious, his eyes intent on hers.</p>
<p>“My name, my very nature, dear [Lady], I hate myself—because it is an enemy to you. Had I my name and race written down, I would tear up like parchment.”</p>
<p>That wasn’t what Romeo was supposed to say! And yet—it was exactly what he was supposed to say! Erin held her breath delighted, as Jasi paused. She was thinking too, and suddenly there was a glint in her eyes. She pulled her hand free, staring haughtily at Wesle.</p>
<p>“You’ve not spoken a hundred words, but I already know that you are no Drake. Art thou not Romeo, a <em>Human?</em>”</p>
<p>He looked ashamed, and retreated a step before he bowed his head.</p>
<p>“I would be neither of those things, fair [Lady], if you dislike them. For you—I would be anything.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, he advanced on her, trying to put an arm around her waist. Jasi pulled back, but then stepped forwards. She grabbed Wesle’s shirt, and he yelped a bit in surprise.</p>
<p>Romeo and Juliet stood together, youthful, full of passion. Juliet, tail thrashing the ground, pulled Romeo closer to her, her eyes alight with passion.</p>
<p>“Tempt not a desperate Drake, Human.”</p>
<p>Erin covered her mouth, whispering the words to herself in shocked glee.</p>
<p>“<em>That’s</em> not in the script!”</p>
<p>But this was more than the script. Erin watched Wesle pull back, full of—of condescending hauteur, but also deep interest. They exchanged more lines, and then Romeo knelt, catching at Juliet’s hand again.</p>
<p>“I fear your hand is too noble for mine to ever touch. But I have two blushing balms to offer you, my lips—to smooth your rough scales with a tender kiss.”</p>
<p>Juliet laughed, pulling back and mocking him with her own words.</p>
<p>“I feel you do your hands too much discredit, sir. For after all, balms touch even [Queens] and [Ladies] – and if two hands should touch, well that too is like a kiss.”</p>
<p>Filled with consternation, Romeo stood up again, gesturing helplessly at Juliet’s face.</p>
<p>“Do not [Queens] and [Ladies] have lips to kiss with?”</p>
<p>“Of course they do. But balm is not meant for lips.”</p>
<p>She laughed at him, but Romeo was too caught up. He approached, and caught hold of her shoulders, speaking urgently.</p>
<p>“Then let us have lips do what hands do! Please, grant me this—answer my request, or let my hope become despair.”</p>
<p>Even as close as they were, Juliet found the wherewithal to turn her head away and up. Her tail twined about a chair leg, gripping it tightly.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid [Ladies] have no hopes to give. Only laws to make.”</p>
<p>“Then do not move as I act out my hope—”</p>
<p>The audience’s jaws dropped as Romeo kissed Juliet once in passion. He whispered the words as she stared at him in shock and something more.</p>
<p>“Now then, the crime of my assaulting a [Lady] rests on your lips, not mine.”</p>
<p>She smiled, tremulously, still holding on to a [Lady]’s dignity even in this moment.</p>
<p>“Oh? My lips bear your crimes now, do they?”</p>
<p>Romeo’s voice was rough.</p>
<p>“Your lips would turn an honest man to crime with their sweetness. Give me my crime back.”</p>
<p>They kissed again. Only this time, Juliet met Romeo halfway. It was a passionate kiss—and frankly, one that Erin thought Grev should not be watching.</p>
<p>On stage, Erin watched as Wesle and Jasi locked lips, and then continued the scene, slightly breathless but still in character. She had no idea if this was an act or if they’d be jumping each other soon.</p>
<p>No—this was part of the act. They were lost in the characters. And even as Erin watched, Romeo and Juliet came to life before her eyes, not Capulet and Montague, but Human and Drake, caught in forbidden interspecies love.</p>
<p>Erin held her breath as the two continued to act. Her eyes were locked on the performance, trying to capture every second of it before it slipped away. This wasn’t an [Immortal Moment]. Time didn’t stop here; because this wasn’t her scene. She was only part of the audience, a witness to the drama.</p>
<p>How could people act like this so naturally? Maybe it was because they had nothing to cling to. There was no ego in the way they held each other, only two lost lovers daring fate to be together.</p>
<p>The two who stood on the small stage in the inn were playing out roles bigger than themselves. For a little while, they were not Wesle the low-level [Guardsman] and Jasi the impoverished Drake working as a [Washer]. They were Romeo and Juliet, and their story was legend.</p>
<p>So Erin sat and watched the play continue. Grev jumped in, all faulty lines and overenthusiastic acting, and she had to fill in multiple roles herself. It was far from a good play, but for those living each scene, it was special in itself. It was new. It was unique. It was…</p>
<p>A bit of culture. A timeless story, travelling from one world to the other. It wasn’t perfect—it wasn’t accurate to the script and it certainly wasn’t in iambic pentameter. But the spirit was there. It was in every line of dialogue, delivered with clumsy passion and all of each actor’s heart.</p>
<p>It was the stage. And it had come to Celum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several hours later, Erin realized the play had to be performed. Even after Wesle and Jasi had collapsed tiredly into the chairs—that was just the start.</p>
<p>They needed actors, a set, and audience! When Erin suggested a live performance both man and Drake froze, but they said yes. She had a feeling they would have said yes even if it meant playing all the parts themselves.</p>
<p>But they wouldn’t be alone. Erin was sure of that. Grev had applauded the play—Grev, the boy who could barely sit in one place for long. And the story was compelling; it was a story <em>for</em> this world, especially given the real and pressing animosity between Drakes and Humans.</p>
<p>And it would be told. Erin was certain of that. She would make it happen.</p>
<p>The first thing they needed was a place to practice. And happily, they had the inn. They just needed to make sure they wouldn’t be interrupted, namely by Miss Agnes, who had come back full of affronted pride to help manage the lunch crowd.</p>
<p>“Lunch? Who has time for lunch!?”</p>
<p>Erin closed the door in Agnes’ face, only opening it again when the woman hammered on the door.</p>
<p>“You can’t just close the inn! Think of all the coin we’d lose!”</p>
<p>“Too bad! Today the inn’s closed! You said you had things to do, right? Well—do them!”</p>
<p>“How dare you! This is my inn and I—”</p>
<p>Erin opened the door and grabbed Miss Agnes’ hand. She pulled Agnes nose-to-nose with her. The woman stared into Erin’s intense, almost magic gaze.</p>
<p>“Get lost! We’re making <em>art </em>here!”</p>
<p>She ran. Erin had no time for her. She was too busy coordinating the play with the others.</p>
<p>“Who would want to act? We need male actors and female ones. And costumes! And a set! I mean, we can do without, but it looks better that way.”</p>
<p>“There aren’t any Drakes in the city, are there? We’d need some to play the Capulets…”</p>
<p>“No wait—there is one! The [Baker], Mister Hess who lives on Springbottom street! I could see him—explain—”</p>
<p>“What about other actors?”</p>
<p>Wesle was stroking his mustache furiously, on an adrenaline high from the performance.</p>
<p>“I’ll go to the Watch House. I’m sure there are plenty of men and women who’d love to try this. But how can I explain it to them?”</p>
<p>“Go together!”</p>
<p>Erin was practically bouncing with excitement. She’d grabbed her bag of coins and she was excitedly pushing gold ones into Grev’s hands.</p>
<p>“You two can do a scene from the play for them. And tell people we’ll perform it here! Tonight! Admission is free, and they can buy food and drink!”</p>
<p>She gave up on counting coins and dumped a handful of them in to Grev’s hands. The young boy stared at the glittering pile, poleaxed.</p>
<p>“I want costumes, Grev! Clothing for rich people, [Lords] and [Ladies]! And swords!”</p>
<p>“I think I can borrow weapons from the Watch House.”</p>
<p>“Okay, no swords! But get me clothing! And curtains! I want big, red ones! Doesn’t matter if you have to get them to sew it together—it’s going to hang up there and we’ll pull them aside for each scene!”</p>
<p>“What about ah, what did you call them? Props?”</p>
<p>“<em>Props!</em>”</p>
<p>Erin pulled Grev back as he eagerly ran for the door.</p>
<p>“Get me…yeah, get a [Carpenter] and a [Painter] to make some backgrounds! No, wait, I’ll do it! They can draw a city, and a garden and—!”</p>
<p>The girl ran out of the inn. Grev led her to a [Painter]’s store—a man who decorated houses and created art for the nobility. She kicked down the door when he refused to open it. He screamed for the Watch, but they were all busy. Busy auditioning for a play.</p>
<p>And when Erin dragged the poor man to meet the best [Carpenter] in town, news was spreading. How could it not? Here was something interesting, and people were talking about it in the streets. Not too many people of course—word could only spread so fast by word of mouth, and Celum was a big city. There was always something happening.</p>
<p>And yet, the word ‘play’ had a magic of its own. It spread from person to person, from the Watch House to the bakery where the [Baker] suddenly took a day off for some strange reason. It attracted attention—especially when they saw that new, young [Innkeeper] ran into Stitchworks, and dragged the [Alchemist] out, kicking and screaming.</p>
<p>Something was clearly happening. People began asking questions. What was a play? Was it like a street performance? No? Then what was it? How did it go? Would it cost anything? When was it happening?</p>
<p>What would it be like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That night, a crowd of people gathered in the Frenzied Hare. It wasn’t a huge amount of people—at least, not in terms of the city’s full population. But it packed two thirds of the room until there was only a little bit of space for the two put-upon [Barmaids] and one [Innkeeper] to circulate the room, passing out drinks and food.</p>
<p>Behind the red curtain that had been hastily stitched together, Erin ran over the play with her actors. They were all new, and they’d barely had time to practice more than once or twice. For any other director, this might have been their worst nightmare.</p>
<p>But to Erin, it was just a lovely dream. The people in front of her might still be memorizing their lines, but they had more passion in their toenails than she’d seen from some actors on stage. She gave them what tips she could, and trusted them to do the rest. Even someone who hadn’t acted in more than one or two school plays like Erin could pass along some important advice.</p>
<p>“Always be looking at the audience. Even if you’re facing one another—do it so the audience can see your entire body. Like this.”</p>
<p>She demonstrated, and the gathered cast watched her nervously. Some asked questions, others shook with stage fright. The [Baker] passed out, but by the time the curtains drew back, he was ready to go, if vibrating with fright.</p>
<p>The play began. Erin was in agony as she alternated between cooking—throwing together the most mass-producible meals she could of soups and breads, sending Maran running to buy more food to sell at outrageous prices to her guests—while hurrying back out to watch the magic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“Two species, both alike in dignity,</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">In fair Celum, where we lay our scene,</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grev stood in the center of the stage, declaiming to the audience. He was white with fright, but his words made the listeners murmur in interest. Erin bit at her fingernails with glee as the actors came out.</p>
<p>The story of Romeo and Juliet was simple. Complex, and simple. At the heart of it was a love affair. But in the first scenes, the play started with a brawl between the two families, or in this case, the two races. Drakes, or rather, people dressed as Drakes and one actual Drake drew real swords and dueled with angry Humans. Actual blood was spilled, but fortunately, not much.</p>
<p>Erin was too busy shoving hot bowls of soup at Miss Agnes—and spilling some on the woman—to see the fight. But she heard the shout as the fighting ceased.</p>
<p>“<em>Swords! Lay down your unlawful swords!</em>”</p>
<p>The actors paused and reluctantly tossed their blades on the ground. A huge man—the actual Watch Captain of Celum himself strode onto the stage with actual [Guardsman] at his back. He was practically bursting with outrage as he roared at the audience who flinched back from him.</p>
<p>“You men, you <em>beasts! </em>Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace! These brawls by old Capulet, and Montague have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets. If ever you disturb our homes again, your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace! Go now! On pain of death, all men depart!”</p>
<p>The play continued as the lead actor, Romeo, played by Wesle, was introduced. He went to a ball at the house of a famous Drake [Lord] and there laid eyes on the lovely Juliet, played by Jasi for the first time.</p>
<p>Erin watched the audience’s expressions. She’d wondered whether they’d like a Drake and Human romance, but despite being from another world and never having seen a play before, they were Humans. Forbidden love captured their hearts and minds and they fell in love with Juliet the moment she took the stage. They sighed and cheered as Romeo and Juliet hit it off.</p>
<p>But then—from the love scene on the balcony, tragedy! Romeo’s friend Mercutio was slain on stage as the audience cried out in shock and horror. In a rage, Romeo confronted the Drake named Tybalt, sword in hand.</p>
<p>Wesle pointed a sword at the Drake’s, full of fury and rage.</p>
<p>“<em>Turn hellhound, turn!</em>”</p>
<p>Erin had liberally used other famous lines from Shakespeare’s plays to add to the drama. The Drake playing Tybalt sneered at Wesle, raising his own sword with a flourish. Undeterred, Romeo advanced, holding his sword with wrath and rage.</p>
<p>“Damn mercy and peace. Fire-eyed fury be my conduct now! Mercutio’s body is not yet cold—waiting for you or I to give it company in the grave!”</p>
<p>“You fool.”</p>
<p>Tybalt sneered at Romeo, lifting his own sword with a dismissive flick of the tail.</p>
<p>“You are no [Duelist], and my own levels number over twenty one. <em>Thou</em>, wretched boy, that didst consort him here shalt with him hence.”</p>
<p>Adapted for this world, and mixed with the language of the Bard himself. Erin watched at the two dueled, and then saw how Juliet found herself trapped in a marriage against her will, while she yearned to be with her true love, Romeo. Her only option was to pretend to die so she could join Romeo in exile.</p>
<p>Thus, Jasi as Juliet implored the dark-skinned girl holding glowing potions to brew her a potion to reunite her with her love. A plea, as it turned out, that Octavia playing Octavia was only too willing to grant.</p>
<p>The Stitch Girl dominated the stage, playing to her audience hard as she mixed harmless liquids together to create a spectacular reaction for the awed crowd. She held the completed glowing red liquid towards Juliet, chattering away.</p>
<p>“A potion to feign death isn’t hard to brew. But this is very costly. Fortunately for you, Octavia’s Stitchworks offers substantial discounts to all customers, and my new line of potions which I’ve marked down nearly 50%—”</p>
<p>“Give me the potion, you heartless [Alchemist]!”</p>
<p>Juliet snatched the bottle away from Octavia, cutting the surprise monologue short. Octavia sniffed, affronted.</p>
<p>“Well excuse <em>me</em> for trying to do business.”</p>
<p>That got a laugh, and then the story continued. At the end, Juliet wept over Romeo’s corpse, too slow, and too late to prevent her love from dying.</p>
<p>As the sounds of her pursuers reached her ears, Juliet stood in despair, holding the dagger in her hands. Erin heard people in the audience shouting at her not to do anything, but it was too late. Oblivious to the crowd, Juliet stared down at the pointed blade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“Yea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O happy dagger,</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">This is thy sheath. There rust and let me die.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dagger plunged into her chest, and the red potion Octavia had made spurted forwards. The crowd was on their feet, but the play continued before they could rush the stage.</p>
<p>In the end, after all the lamentation was done, the Watch Captain stood in front of the audience, head bowed, standing in front of the grieving parents of the slain lovers. He spoke to the crowd, his deep voice and sorrowful eyes finding each person in the crowd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“A glooming peace this morning with it brings;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">For never was a story of more woe</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And after that—there was nothing. Erin had never seen a speechless crowd, but when they regained their voices there was only sound and cheering. The cast had to come out to bow, had to shake hands and even perform some scenes over again, such was the enthusiasm in the room.</p>
<p>Erin missed all of it. Halfway through the play the audience had forgotten to eat, so spellbound they’d been. But with the thrilling conclusion their hunger came back in force. She cooked like there was no tomorrow, even though it was tomorrow by the time she was done.</p>
<p>And when it was over? When the last actor staggered out of the inn and Erin had hugged Jasi and watched Agnes collapse onto a table, the bag of coins she’d earned held blissfully on her chest. When she’d seen Wesle walk away, his step full of confidence and—and hope?</p>
<p>She went back up to her room, walking slowly. Erin’s head was full of cotton; her arms and legs were lead. She lay back in her bed, too tired to undress or clean her teeth. The curtain call was upon her, but she delayed the ending for one moment to stare up at the ceiling.</p>
<p>In the darkness, Erin smiled. She spoke to the night.</p>
<p>“Good. This isn’t boring at all.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Innkeeper Level 29!]</p>
<p>[Skill – Crowd Control Obtained!]</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Where did the magic come from? It came from the air around her, the hard wooden desk she sat at, and herself. It flowed through her blood, ran through her hair—it was in her. Ceria reached into her inner self and found magic there. With each breath she took, with each pump of her heart, the magic lived through her.</p>
<p>She drew a portion of it out now, and gave it shape. She pushed, and made the magic condense into a small ball, drawing in itself. Becoming…</p>
<p>Water. The clear liquid flowed into existence, forming a shaft of brilliance in the sunlight. And then, as Ceria held it in place in the air, she froze it.</p>
<p>Water pooled and stiffened, the clear liquid clouding, becoming solid. Ceria watched as the pointed tip of the icicle gleamed, ready to be launched. It was a small missile she’d made—barely longer than her middle finger, in truth. But the [Ice Dart] spell had been designed for rapid-fire attacks en masse. With it, she could turn a Goblin into a pincushion or overwhelm another type of monster.</p>
<p>This dart was of better…construction…than most. That was to say, when Ceria usually used the spell she was concentrated more on speed than aesthetic or form. As a result, some of her darts would have jagged edges or be angled awkwardly, as if the icicles had bent while being frozen. That could cause them to veer off from their targets, or fail to do as much damage.</p>
<p>But this? This was an ideal form of the spell. Ceria stared at the frozen missile floating in front of her and smiled. It was the perfect example of her magical talents, and her superior half-Elven heritage. She’d barely felt the effort of making the spell. That would prove—</p>
<p>“And just <em>what</em> do you call this?”</p>
<p>A hand reached out and touched the floating shard of ice. Ceria blinked as a rather tall, dark-haired man in robes lifted the product of her spell up and regarded it with disdain. He sniffed at it, and then snapped at her.</p>
<p>“<em>Focus</em>, Springwalker. Your [Ice Shard] spell mixes the cold and water aspects together. You are freezing the water you create rather than forming the shape and solidifying it as separate stages.”</p>
<p>His hand didn’t glow red, but for a second the air rippled with heat around his hand. In a moment, Ceria’s [Ice Shard] was gone, evaporated in a puff of steam which instantly dissipated.</p>
<p>“Try again, and this time <em>concentrate.</em> Your spells need to be well-formed, not leaking pools of wasted mana.”</p>
<p>“What? What’s wrong with my spell?”</p>
<p>She couldn’t help the words as they burst from her mouth. Ceria glared indignantly up at the [Mage] who’d dissipated her spell. He stared back, eyes cold and annoyed.</p>
<p>“Your composition was weaker, due to the air trapped within the icicle as you froze the water while making it. In addition, the spell itself was not straight—it deviated slightly near the tip. Finally, the point was unsharpened; merely a blunt tip.”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>Ceria knew it was true. Even so, she felt the need to deny the criticism.</p>
<p>“It’s <em>almost</em> fully correct! Those are just minor details!”</p>
<p>Another sniff.</p>
<p>“Details are what set apart true mages from amateurs. If you wish to lower your standards, Wistram is not the place for you. Try again, and this time concentrate properly.”</p>
<p>Ceria heard laughter around the class and felt herself going red. Blood rushed to the tips of her pointed ears, but she said nothing. She ground her teeth as she focused again on the spell, trying to tune out the world around her.</p>
<p>The man who’d admonished her so casually—the senior [Mage] in charge of this class’s magic lesson named Rievan Forstrom—walked on without a backward glance.</p>
<p>That had been humiliating. And unfair! Ceria tried to focus on her spell again, but this time her concentration was shot. The magic in her and around her was harder to control, and she was having trouble condensing it into a physical form.</p>
<p>There were still people chuckling in the large room Ceria was taking her second class of the day in. She heard one particularly obnoxious voice laughing louder than the rest.</p>
<p>Charles de Trevalier made no effort to conceal his glee at Ceria’s upbraiding. Worse, Rievan didn’t seem to mind. The mage walked over to another student and began talking in a loud voice, lecturing the unfortunate girl about the quality of her spell, a bundle of sparks that was supposed to be the [Electric Jolt] spell.</p>
<p>After he’d gone, and the other students were talking again, comparing notes, complaining, or just making conversation, the young man sitting at the desk next to Ceria leaned over. Pisces lowered his voice so only she could hear him as he whispered.</p>
<p>“I thought the spell was appropriately formulated. I rather think the true crux of the issue is that he doesn’t like you.”</p>
<p>He nodded to Rievan, and Ceria saw their instructor was showing the Human girl how to do the spell properly. Neat, focused webs of lightning flashed from one of his palms into the other. He was certainly critical of the girl, but he wasn’t being <em>nearly</em> as sharp with her as he had been with Ceria.</p>
<p>She made a face. Yes, their instructor for the new students taking the Magical Foundations class did seem to have it out for her. And she was under no illusions as to why.</p>
<p>He was Human. Ceria was a half-Elf. But more importantly, she thought that he might be a Human who’d originally grown up in Terandria, which would explain his dislike for her.</p>
<p>“As if he’d ever tried casting a spell while fighting off a Goblin tribe.”</p>
<p>She grumbled as she tried to form the spell again. Maybe she should give up and try [Stone Dart] or [Flame Jet] instead? But no, he’d probably just reprimand her for giving up on the spell. Pisces looked sympathetic as Ceria tried to spin the water out from her fingertips and hold it in position before she froze it again.</p>
<p>They were in class. It was slightly odd for Ceria to be sitting in this neat room at a small desk—she’d never gone through anything like this growing up—but Wistram taught countless students each year, and they’d developed a process to teach their students as a whole.</p>
<p>One of these ways was giving the prospective students a variety of mandatory courses to take during their first month. Each day, the students had countless lessons and magical theorems and basic spells hammered into them by various mid-level [Mages]. And in one of those classes, this one, the basics of magic were being re-taught to Ceria, much to her displeasure.</p>
<p>Basic magic. Pure magic. People had many names for the subject, but this class had been introduced as elementary magic by their instructor. Ceria hated it.</p>
<p>The study of basic telekinesis, magical composition and fundamental aspects of magical theory like spellcraft were lumped into one category by most mages. It was a branch of magic few practitioners focused on, outside of learning how to levitate small objects and refine their mana flow and so on. Nonetheless, it was vitally important for any mage who wanted to cast spells, and so most mages grew passable at forming their spells properly. A bent [Ice Shard] spell would be far less effective, just like how a poorly-made warding spell might not block all the arrows properly.</p>
<p>It was important, yes, but tiresome. Mages specializing in this rare field liked to refer to it as ‘pure’ magic. Others, Ceria included, thought of it as boring magic. And she was all the more angry because her spells were good, damn it!</p>
<p>She didn’t need to work on her [Ice Shard] spell. What Ceria wanted was to start learning more advanced spells, but she was stuck. Probationary Wistram students took all the classes they could, and Ceria knew that the efficacy of her spells would be tested during the examination process at the end of the month. So she gritted her teeth and reapplied herself to forming the best [Ice Shard] spell she could.</p>
<p>At the desk next to her, Pisces focused on his own spell. He didn’t know any Tier 2 combat spells, so he was casting [Electric Jolt] as well. Rievan had taught the entire class the spell, but he’d insisted that anyone who knew a higher-Tier spell should practice that instead. The more complex a spell was, the more a mage benefited from working with it.</p>
<p>The young man let a spark of electricity jump between his fingers, almost in a straight line. He seemed focused and at ease at the same time—eager to learn, and not at all bothered. He kept talking as Ceria labored over her spell.</p>
<p>“I really hadn’t considered the implications of altering a spell in its base state. Had you, Ceria? Certainly it makes no sense to significantly alter basic constructions and increase the complexity, but had you considered what would happen if you turned your [Ice Shard] spell into, say, an orb? Wouldn’t that completely change the nature of the spell?”</p>
<p>Ceria grunted irritably as she tried to make the point of her shard sharper.</p>
<p>“The mana cost’s the same, and so is the amount of water you can work with. What’s the point? A ball of ice isn’t useful, and round shapes are harder.”</p>
<p>Pisces grinned.</p>
<p>“Well, I was just thinking, if we can alter basic spells like that, what’s the point in learning spells at all? We could just learn basic fundamental magics and extrapolate from there. It might take a long time, but if we could <em>teach ourselves </em>magic—”</p>
<p>“I see you have time to talk rather than practice.”</p>
<p>The loud voice made Pisces and Ceria both jump. She cursed as her attention wavered and the water she was holding in place lost its form. The young man sat up quickly as Rievan loomed over his desk, looking down his sharp nose at him.</p>
<p>“You are new, are you not? Your name is…Pisces.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir.”</p>
<p>Pisces looked ahead respectfully while Rievan scowled at him. He didn’t appear intimidated, just alert and wary. And confident. Ceria didn’t see a bit of doubt in his posture.</p>
<p>“You have not yet been admitted as a full student to Wistram. I suggest you dedicate yourself to studying, while you have time. But since you do not feel the need—show the class how far you have progressed with your [Electric Jolt] spell.”</p>
<p>The other practicing students looked over as Pisces raised his hands. Rievan was clearly expecting Pisces to make a mistake and pounce on it, but to his surprise—and Ceria’s—a steady stream of purple-blue lightning crackled from one of Pisces’s hands into the other, looking for all the world like a bright river of electricity.</p>
<p>Drops of water spattered on Ceria’s desk and evaporated as she lost control of her own spell. She was gaping. Just a bit. Pisces’ control of the spell was immaculate. Both she and Rievan knew it. After a moment, the mage nodded. He looked at Pisces with a hint of respect and addressed the other students as a whole.</p>
<p>“Acceptable. Observe, class. Young Pisces has managed to divert the whole of the spell into striking his other palm, without letting the individual threads of magic separate as the electricity desires. Emulate his example. Learn from it. We will focus on the same tomorrow, by refining your basic levitation spells. Class dismissed.”</p>
<p>He whirled and walked towards the door. Pisces paused, letting himself smile a tiny bit. Then he turned to Ceria.</p>
<p>“Shall we go?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“How did you do that?”</p>
<p>“It’s just a matter of adjusting the spell.”</p>
<p>“I know <em>that—</em>”</p>
<p>Ceria snapped as she hurried after Pisces. She had to walk fast to keep up with him—Pisces was taller than she was, and he had an effortless stride despite the small bag he carried. She was carrying a similar one, and Ceria didn’t like the weight it put on one shoulder. The strap was digging into her flesh. Why didn’t Humans use backpacks? They were more practical, if not as easily accessible.</p>
<p>They were walking through the corridors of Wistram, leaving the class they’d just been in. Ceria and Pisces stopped in a large corridor and found a number of other students—all young, prospective students like them—milling around there.</p>
<p>They were in one of the sections of Wistram devoted to teaching. As such, a branching corridor led to several hallways with classrooms, and it was the intersection here where students could find a class, or walk to another intersection to go elsewhere in Wistram.</p>
<p>“Why are you so amazed? It’s not as if the spell was Tier 3, or even Tier 2. Your [Ice Shard] spell was far harder to maintain.”</p>
<p>“In terms of mana, maybe. But your mastery of the spell was nearly perfect. Even the teacher left you alone! Are you <em>sure</em> you didn’t know the spell beforehand?”</p>
<p>“Very sure. I just don’t find Tier 1 spells that challenging, at least in making them work in the most optimal way. It’s like having a map with your destination circled; it’s obvious what needs to be done.”</p>
<p>“Well.”</p>
<p>Ceria blew out her cheeks, partly exasperated, but mostly impressed. Pisces certainly was gifted. She looked around the other corridors and frowned.</p>
<p>“Where to next?”</p>
<p>Pisces frowned. He stared at one of the windows. The sun was nearly directly overhead. Wistram had other ways of telling time of course, but this was the easiest to use.</p>
<p>“Um…illusion class, I think. After that’s destruction magic.”</p>
<p>“So we’re free?”</p>
<p>“Unless you’ve figured out where the illusion class is being held yet?”</p>
<p>“Nope. You?”</p>
<p>Pisces shook his head. Ceria looked around and saw the other students were milling about, equally confused as to where to go. She gritted her teeth, annoyed.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe there aren’t any signs.”</p>
<p>“Or a map. That would be quite helpful.”</p>
<p>There was a trick to Wistram. Actually, more than one trick; it was like walking into a dungeon full of traps, really, but there was a trick to being a student that Ceria had quickly realized. And it was that being a student meant you had to learn <em>everything</em>. Not just magic. Even basic things like directions, where the bathrooms were located—all of that vital information you had to find out for yourself, because no one would teach you.</p>
<p>Class, for instance. Ceria had heard of royal academies some nations had founded to train [Strategists], or [Scholars] and even [Mages] of their own, but where those places were neat, highly-regulated affairs, Wistram clearly believed in finding things out for yourself.</p>
<p>Case in point. The first day Ceria and Pisces had been in Wistram—the first full day, not counting their exciting voyage and rescue—they’d been given a tour of Wistram, as well as supplies to be used during their time here. Ink pots, quills—even a low-level spellbook of their own! Calvaron had been one of the students who’d shown Ceria where to go and not to go, and what places were off-limits to new students like her.</p>
<p>Only, it appeared that while older students like Calvaron had been only too willing to show the new students around the first day, they hadn’t pointed out specific classrooms. Thus, when class had actually started, Ceria had had to run around with Pisces, walking into classes in session before they found the one they were assigned to.</p>
<p>This was embarrassing, but not the worst part. Some classes were easy enough to figure out, and the teachers had even posted directions on the large message board next to the dining hall. But no matter how hard Ceria and the other students had searched, they still hadn’t found some of the other classes they were slated to attend. The illusion classroom was <em>supposed</em> to be somewhere on the ground floor, but no one had found it yet.</p>
<p>Ceria was certain that was some kind of twisted joke. She scowled as she wondered what she might be learning if she was in the right class—she didn’t know any illusion spells, and she would dearly love to learn one or two. But she yawned once, which prompted Pisces to yawn as well.</p>
<p>“I don’t wish to seem lax, but I very much doubt three more hours of unsuccessful searching would do either of us any good, do you?”</p>
<p>“Probably not.”</p>
<p>“Then I shall return to my room for a quick rest. Would you like to…?”</p>
<p>Ceria thought about it as Pisces eyed her hopefully. Her instinct was to say ‘no’, but it wasn’t as if Pisces was inviting her into his room. And besides—</p>
<p>“Fine. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>She and Pisces began walking out of the intersection. Their departure seemed to make up the other new student’s minds, and they began to leave too. Soon, the wide corridors were packed with busy people, some tripping over their robes.</p>
<p>Robes. Ceria snorted as she walked along in her normal, <em>practical</em> leggings and tunic. Over half of the new students were wearing long robes, usually dark blue or black. They’d bought it along with a low-quality wand, as if it were prerequisite for being a [Mage]. All it really did, in Ceria’s opinion, was make you look like an idiot. The older students, Calvaron and Beatrice included, didn’t wear robes. Then again, Calvaron was a Centaur and Beatrice was a Dullahan, so perhaps that was an unfair comparison.</p>
<p>This time Ceria took the lead, which meant that she could set the pace. Pisces walked next to her, easily keeping up as they turned left and right and went up a flight of stairs. Both had to concentrate on where they were going—there wasn’t much traffic in the hallways except at the busiest of intersections, but Wistram was a labyrinth. It was all too easy to get lost and turn the wrong way and find yourself quite a ways away from where you wanted to be.</p>
<p>“I thought that was a rather informative class, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Maybe.”</p>
<p>Ceria grunted as she walked along. She made a face. She was still sour over being reprimanded.</p>
<p>“I certainly benefited from someone showing me how to cast the [Electric Jolt] spell, and the way our teacher optimized the spell was quite interesting.”</p>
<p>“That I’ll grant you. Still, learning to make a weak spell slightly more effective wasn’t why I came here.”</p>
<p>Ceria stopped at an intersection where two paths split off diagonally from each other. It was odd architecture, and Ceria couldn’t remember which way led to their rooms. Pisces pointed.</p>
<p>“I think we go right here. Well, what did you expect?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I guess I thought we’d be picking up higher-Tier spells, not working on the basics.”</p>
<p>“I would like that. But we <em>are</em> new students, aren’t we? If we don’t improve on our fundamental abilities, we wouldn’t be able to cast better spells anyways.”</p>
<p>That was true. Ceria knew [Ice Shard], but she could barely create more than twenty darts before she had to sit down. That was a far cry from a good mage’s capabilities, let alone a Gold-rank [Mage], for example.</p>
<p>“I guess you’re right. Still…”</p>
<p>She scowled, not wanting to put her feelings into words. She walked briskly forwards, and Pisces stepped a bit more quickly to catch up.</p>
<p>She knew they had to make an odd pair. Ceria was a half-Elf, and Pisces was…well, a young man who looked more like a peasant than a student. There were odder pairings, Calvaron and Beatrice for example, and Ceria had seen Drakes and even a Selphid walking down the halls just this morning. But it was strange to be talking so familiarly with a Human, given where both came from.</p>
<p>Pisces cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“I noticed the lecturer was ah, slightly hostile towards you, Ceria. Maybe it’s because of your…”</p>
<p>“My race, you mean?”</p>
<p>Ceria grimaced as she twitched her ears in annoyance. Pisces made a noncommittal sound.</p>
<p>“Straight ahead here, I believe. Do you think he’s from Terandria?”</p>
<p>She shrugged.</p>
<p>“He could be. If he lived in the north or eastern parts of the continent…or not. It doesn’t really matter—half-Elves don’t have a good reputation anywhere.”</p>
<p>“Really? I know that some nations in Terandria ah, don’t have the best relations with your people, but everywhere?”</p>
<p>“You’ve heard the rumors about half-Elves, right? We’re thieves, we can’t be trusted, we hate Humans—”</p>
<p>“But those are rumors, surely. Just like how you can’t let a Selphid into a graveyard, and a Gnoll will bite your face off if you offend them.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I mean—yes. Come on, it’s this way.”</p>
<p>Ceria turned away from Pisces. She wasn’t used to someone taking her side, and it was uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Okay, maybe in other parts of the world we’re more welcomed, but half-Elves keep to ourselves no matter where we go. And if he <em>is </em>from Terandria, there’s bad blood. Lots of it. Centuries of conflict.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. I just didn’t think he was being that fair in his critique of you, that’s all.”</p>
<p>“Well—thanks.”</p>
<p>They walked on. Ceria began to recognize their part of the citadel as the view in the windows changed. She and Pisces occupied some sort of overlook right above the rocks of the isle, and as she stared out at the calm, peaceful bubble of water surrounding Wistram, she spotted their rooms.</p>
<p>“Here we are.”</p>
<p>“Here we are indeed.”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded to Ceria.</p>
<p>“I’ll ah, take a nap. Would you like to have lunch together later?”</p>
<p>“I—guess so. Okay. See you later.”</p>
<p>He nodded, smiled, and yawned. Ceria yawned too, and she found herself fumbling with the lock in her keyhole. She tossed her heavy bag onto a chair, wincing as she heard a sealed pot of ink <em>clink</em> against the wood, and rubbed at her shoulder. Then she yawned again.</p>
<p>It was strange. Ceria was <em>exhausted,</em> and the day wasn’t even truly begun. Five hours had passed since they’d woken up. Well, six, but the first hour had just been comprised of dressing, eating, and finding their way to class. The other five had involved studying.</p>
<p>Maybe if it was just studying in the sense of reading books and listening to someone talk Ceria would have been more awake. But in Wistram, studying also meant casting magic. She’d been taught several basic spells and forced to use her mana to prove to her teachers that she could perform basic incantations. That wasn’t hard, but she’d had to do it again and again.</p>
<p>Repeatedly casting spells, even low-Tier ones, was extremely draining. The result was that even at midmorning of their second day, both Ceria and Pisces felt physically exhausted, if not mentally. They wandered into their rooms and fell asleep for a few solid hours before waking bleary-eyed and restless.</p>
<p>Of the two, Ceria was the most exhausted. She barely managed to rouse herself for a very late lunch after Pisces knocked on her door, and she stumbled into the grand dining hall with a scowl as she got her food.</p>
<p>Raucous laughter greeted both her and Pisces as they sat at one of the tables. Calvaron and Beatrice were seated at a large table next to the couches, and they waved the two new [Mages] over. Ceria hadn’t seen them much yesterday, but she saw the two older students were studying at their table while they ate.</p>
<p>Spell books, expensive, magical, and sometimes literally glowing with the spells inscribed on them, were carelessly propped open by bowls and mugs. The Dullahan and Centaur looked like they’d been eating and sitting for a while, judging by the mess on their table. Calvaron swept some dishes aside as he called out to Ceria.</p>
<p>“Your hair looks like a tangled spiderweb, Springwalker! Did you get a bit of rest after all the magic practice this morning?”</p>
<p>She glared at him as she put down her food—thick slices of roasted mushrooms in a sauce and what she thought was pork—on the table.</p>
<p>“I’d laugh—but I forgot that I don’t like jokes.”</p>
<p>“Ooh, touchy. Are you in the same class as Ceria, Pisces? I’d sit far away from her if I were you, or she might bite your head off.”</p>
<p>“I can leave. Or throw these mushrooms at you.”</p>
<p>Calvaron ducked his head slightly as Ceria raised her fork with one of the dripping mushrooms.</p>
<p>“Don’t, please. I hate mushrooms.”</p>
<p>“I’m allergic to mushrooms.”</p>
<p>The Centaur, Human, and half-Elf all looked at Beatrice. She was calmly eating some peas, chewing without much expression.</p>
<p>“Sorry. I can take them away if it’s a bother.”</p>
<p>“Just don’t drop them on my armor.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded and settled down as she began to eat her meal. Calvaron wasn’t done teasing though. The Centaur grinned at the two others.</p>
<p>“Did you just wake up? Exhausted, are we?”</p>
<p>“Quite.”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded as he stuffed his face full of meat. He’d completely ignored the mushrooms as well.</p>
<p>“I had no idea—mnph, this is good—that the lessons could be this intense. Will they always be so hard?”</p>
<p>Beatrice looked mildly disgusted at Pisces’ display of eating. She moved her head off the table and onto her lap as Calvaron nodded and laughed again.</p>
<p>“Everyone always complains on the first day. Have you two never been taught by another [Mage] before?”</p>
<p>Ceria shook her head, ruefully.</p>
<p>“I learnt all my spells from books. I taught myself.”</p>
<p>Pisces hesitated before replying.</p>
<p>“There was a local [Hedge Mage] in my…village who agreed to teach me.”</p>
<p>Calvaron nodded as he reached for a drink of dark purple juice. Ceria smelled grape and wished she’d gotten some.</p>
<p>“The first lessons are always the hardest. Once they’re sure you’re not making novice mistakes in how you form your spells, the teachers will go easier on you.”</p>
<p>“I hope so. But do we have to take classes at all? I thought Wistram let mages study how they pleased.”</p>
<p>Scowling, Ceria bit into another mushroom, chewing hard. <em>Someone</em> hadn’t cooked these thoroughly enough. Beatrice and Calvaron shrugged in reply.</p>
<p>“Some people just study by themselves. But until you’re sure that’s the way you want to go, I’d pay attention in the lessons and try to impress the mages assigned to teach you.”</p>
<p>“For the exam.”</p>
<p>“Exactly!”</p>
<p>The Centaur grinned as Ceria’s stomach gave a small lurch and Pisces paused long enough to look worried.</p>
<p>“Will we learn any complex spells before then?”</p>
<p>“Some basic ones, yes, but complex? Not unless your teacher’s quite odd. You lot are only here for a month—all of your courses are the most basic ones.”</p>
<p>Beatrice nodded.</p>
<p>“Boring classes.”</p>
<p>“Golem creation, scroll scribing, trap spells and enchantments—all of that only gets taught when we’re in our second years at the earliest. Most students don’t get to those kind of lessons until year <em>six. </em>Talented ones get there sooner, but…”</p>
<p>“Wonderful.”</p>
<p>Ceria muttered as she drank her own cup of water. Pisces looked dispirited as well, but then he turned to the older students hopefully.</p>
<p>“If you’re going to be helpful, mind telling us where the illusion classes are being taught? No one’s found the classroom so far.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Illusion class?”</p>
<p>They laughed. Well, Calvaron laughed and Beatrice chuckled. Ceria frowned at them.</p>
<p>“What’s the joke?”</p>
<p>The Centaur scratched at his head and smiled enigmatically at the two of them.</p>
<p>“I…<em>could</em> tell you how to find it, but I’m afraid I’d have to charge you two for that.”</p>
<p>“What? You’d ask us for <em>money?</em>”</p>
<p>Ceria was outraged—she’d thought the Centaur and Dullahan were friends, or at least friendly!—but Calvaron was shaking his head, trying not to chuckle.</p>
<p>“No, you see—ah, Beatrice, what should I do? If I explain it, I’ll lose the chance to charge them for that as well. Do you think we should just give away a secret like that?”</p>
<p>The half-Elf had no idea what they were talking about, but Beatrice paused for a second before nodding her head with her hands.</p>
<p>“It’s not a big secret. You should tell them to be friendly. Or she’ll throw mushrooms at us.”</p>
<p>Calvaron glanced at Ceria. She was indeed considering heaving her dish at his head. Pisces just watched the other two thoughtfully. At last, Calvaron sighed, sounding put-upon.</p>
<p>“I suppose we can. Okay you two, you’re about to learn a bit more about how Wistram works. For free, no less.”</p>
<p>“What <em>are </em>you talking about?”</p>
<p>Beatrice sighed.</p>
<p>“They are a currency. Secrets.”</p>
<p>Calvaron paused, mouth open and looked over at Beatrice with a frown. Ceria and Pisces just stared at the two of them.</p>
<p>“Thanks for ruining my moment, Beatrice.”</p>
<p>“Welcome.”</p>
<p>The Dullahan shrugged impassively. Ceria stared at her and the resigned Centaur.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You heard her. Wistram runs on secrets, not coin around here. You would have figured it out sooner or later, but…”</p>
<p>“I still don’t get it.”</p>
<p>“It’s very simple. If you want something—a spell, a favor, or even another secret, you have to pay for it. Unfortunately, or fortunately for those of us without money, the most valuable thing around here is secrets.”</p>
<p>“Secrets.”</p>
<p>Ceria felt like she was speaking another language. Calvaron wiggled his eyebrows as he smiled at her.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Secrets about where treasure’s buried, unique classes, spells no one’s heard of—I say secrets, but it’s more general knowledge in most cas—”</p>
<p>“<em>What are you talking about?</em>”</p>
<p>“Secrets, Springwalker! Secrets!”</p>
<p>Pisces stopped Ceria from getting up and kicking the table over. He smiled at her.</p>
<p>“I believe Calvaron is saying Wistram uses a bartering system.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>It took a while, but with Calvaron to explain and Pisces to clarify—and Beatrice to nod silently—Ceria finally got it.</p>
<p>Wistram used secrets like coins. Small secrets, big secrets—they were what [Mages] and students alike traded each other for favors, or even real objects.</p>
<p>“Like coin? You could trade a secret for a—a bag of gold coins?”</p>
<p>Calvaron nodded happily as he ate something yellow and strange he called a ‘banana’. It looked disgusting to Ceria.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Wistram doesn’t have much use for coin, although there are always merchants sailing in to harbor…but secrets and magic are the real coin around here.”</p>
<p>“But how does that work? Are there really that many secrets there? No—how could you keep that many secrets for so long? How could a system like that keep functioning?”</p>
<p>The Centaur shrugged.</p>
<p>“It works because it has to. We need some kind of currency, and money isn’t good enough. And secrets have a weight of their own. True, if you went around telling everyone then the secret’s worthless. But if there were a room only you and someone else knew about—or a part of the academy that you have to have a password to get into—”</p>
<p>“Which there are.”</p>
<p>“—Which there are, thank you Beatrice. The system might not work anywhere else, but Wistram has so many secrets and hidden surprises that even now people are finding new things out. Just the other day, someone found a wall that disappears if you say the right words.”</p>
<p>“Oh? And what was behind the wall?”</p>
<p>Pisces was curious, but Calvaron just waggled a finger at him.</p>
<p>“If I told you that, you’d have to give me a secret. A small one to know and a big one for the actual words, which I don’t in fact know. I’d have to trade some secrets for it, you see.”</p>
<p>“That is the <em>stupidest</em> way of—”</p>
<p>Ceria rubbed at her head. This had to be a joke. She closed her eyes and came up with a flaw after two seconds of thought.</p>
<p>“What if—and hear me out here—what if someone traded you for a secret, and then didn’t pay up? How would anyone prove you’d lost anything?”</p>
<p>“Truth spells.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>“If someone doesn’t make good on your favor, all you have to do is go around telling people they’re a lying backstabber. No one will trust them, and your problem’s solved.”</p>
<p>“Something that can only work in a place where magic users are as common as dirt.”</p>
<p>Pisces looked approving. Calvaron grinned as he nodded.</p>
<p>“Of course, some people have more secrets to trade than others. Some people just use secrets when they have to—they trade gold for secrets, or get someone else to make all the trades for them. Like me.”</p>
<p>“You?”</p>
<p>“I’m a broker. I have a lot of secrets in my head, and even more that I don’t even know myself. Spelled parchment that erases itself when opened—that was popular a while ago. Messages in bottles, that sort of thing.”</p>
<p>Ceria eyed Calvaron slightly askance.</p>
<p>“And you trade secrets, is that it? If I have a juicy one, I can trade it to you for something else?”</p>
<p>“Anything you want to know. I accept all kinds of minor secrets; if you’ve got gold or gems I’ll take that too, but I prefer secrets.”</p>
<p>He grinned at both half-Elf and Human sitting at the table. After a second, the half-Elf rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“This place gets weirder by the second. Okay, remind me to never ask you for a favor.”</p>
<p>“Aw, don’t be like that. Look, because we’re friends I’ll share a secret with you. On the house.”</p>
<p>Both Ceria and Pisces eyed Calvaron dubiously, the former with considerably more suspicion than the latter. Calvaron laughed lightly again. He looked around and muttered something—Ceria saw his fingertips flash for a second—before he spoke to them in a quiet voice.</p>
<p>“Here’s a free secret for you new students: most magic-based classes require at least ten levels in [Mage] to learn. A lot of them take at least twenty levels. That’s why most classes just teach the basics—they want you to have a high [Mage] level before you try to specialize.”</p>
<p>“Is that really true?”</p>
<p>Ceria wasn’t sure if she should be impressed or not. It was probably true, but was that really a secret worth trading?</p>
<p>“This would be a small secret, wouldn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Pretty small, unless you knew the exact requirements for a class. That would constitute a large secret.”</p>
<p>“And you’re just giving this one away because we’re friends, huh?”</p>
<p>“Just a sample. Now, if you want to know anything else, we can negotiate.”</p>
<p>Pisces frowned.</p>
<p>“That’s very mercenary of you.”</p>
<p>“Hey, we’ve all got to eat. And if I can build up a bit of credit on the side—”</p>
<p>“So you’re not going to tell us anything else unless we pay you.”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>Ceria frowned.</p>
<p>“That’s not fair. Tell us at least one more secret—an obvious one.”</p>
<p>Calvaron raised his eyebrows, looking mildly exasperated.</p>
<p>“I just gave you a secret for free.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, a pretty useless one. We’ll get our classes no matter what happens—who cares about what’ll happen ten levels from now? Tell us something we can use in Wistram.”</p>
<p>She frowned at the Centaur and he frowned back, but he did seem to consider her suggestion. He nudged his friend gently in the side of her armor.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Beatrice?”</p>
<p>She shrugged.</p>
<p>“Mushrooms.”</p>
<p>With a put-upon sigh, Calvaron nodded.</p>
<p>“Fine. Here’s another one, but this <em>is</em> the last secret. It’s about your books.”</p>
<p>“Our books?”</p>
<p>“You got new spellbooks on the first day, right? Come on, let’s see them.”</p>
<p>Reluctantly, Ceria and Pisces pulled out their spellbooks. They had indeed been issued mostly-empty books for apprentice mages. The first few pages had been filled with notes and spells in another person’s hand, but the majority was blank. Calvaron chuckled as he showed the students the empty pages.</p>
<p>“Thought so. Here’s something the academy does all the time. They take old books—the ones left behind by students—and give them to new students. You’ll never find anything beyond a Tier 2 spell in the spellbooks, because the older mages will sort through the lot to make sure they don’t give anything good to the new students.”</p>
<p>“Huh. So there are better spellbooks out there?”</p>
<p>Calvaron and Beatrice nodded.</p>
<p>“Yup. You’ll be able to read them as you rise in, well, status. You can take out books from the libraries, but only experienced students know where the good books are hidden.”</p>
<p>“And you would know where they’re kept, I presume?”</p>
<p>The Centaur raised his hands.</p>
<p>“Me? Perish the thought. If I could trade for that secret, I would. But the locations of the secret libraries and tomes are among the biggest secrets you can trade for.”</p>
<p>“And that’s your big secret. Again, it sounds more like something you could’ve just told us to be friendly.”</p>
<p>Ceria crossed her arms, annoyed and slightly disgusted. She saw Calvaron exchange an amused glance with Beatrice, and scowled fiercely.</p>
<p>“All of your ‘secrets’ sound pretty useless to me, Calvaron.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know about that.”</p>
<p>He avoided her gaze, an amused smile on his face as he snagged a slice of pork from her plate.</p>
<p>“All knowledge is useful to someone else. And there are secrets and <em>secrets. </em>For instance, the fact that Miss Springwalker here is a half-Elf? Not really a secret. But the knowledge that Pisces here has a rapier and a silver bell? That’s important knowledge. Someone might ask where he came from, knowing that.”</p>
<p>“How did you—?”</p>
<p>“And that this morning, Pisces managed to impress even Rievan during class? And that he didn’t like Miss Ceria?”</p>
<p>“Calvaron—”</p>
<p>The Centaur cut Ceria off. He looked directly at her.</p>
<p>“And of course, there’s your origins. The records are sealed of course, but anyone can look up old records. And half-Elves have long histories. In fact, if you looked back at certain Terandrian city arrest warrants, you could find a small bounty on a certain half-Elf kid for theft, property damage and—”</p>
<p>Ceria <em>slammed </em>her hands on the table, cutting the Centaur off. He stared at her surprised. She was shaking, and Ceria saw Beatrice grab Calvaron’s side warningly. But she didn’t say or do anything that would start something else. Without a word, she stood up and walked away. Calvaron called out after her, but Ceria ignored him. She stalked off, leaving her unfinished meal behind.</p>
<p>“Ceria? Ah! Ceria, please wait!”</p>
<p>She heard the voice calling out after her as she stomped away. At first Ceria just walked faster, but the voice kept shouting her name. In the end, she grudgingly slowed to let Pisces catch up.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The young man slowed and panted—theatrically, Ceria thought—as he caught up with her. He smiled nervously as she glared at him.</p>
<p>“I ah, I just wanted to walk back with you.”</p>
<p>“Did you?”</p>
<p>“Well—”</p>
<p>Ceria started walking again, and Pisces hesitated before matching her pace.</p>
<p>“Calvaron is, uh, apologetic.”</p>
<p>“Good for him.”</p>
<p>She gritted her teeth. Pisces paused again before he adopted a placating tone.</p>
<p>“They were trying to help us, or so I feel. I understand that they went too far—”</p>
<p>“I came here to learn magic, not to find out secrets about other people and trade favors and gossip like a pack of simpering [Noblewomen].”</p>
<p>“As did I.”</p>
<p>Pisces took two strides forwards, and looked at Ceria. She glared at him, emotions running hot.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. I would just like to opine that, well, we are new to Wistram.”</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“So, rather than get too upset—why don’t you forget Calvaron’s transgression, and have a drink with me instead? It does no good to get too worked up right away, in my experience.”</p>
<p>“Oh really? Well, how much experience have you had?”</p>
<p>“None.”</p>
<p>Pisces grinned at her widely, and Ceria’s face went slack before she laughed unwillingly. The anger drained out of her as quick as it had come, leaving her feeling more than a little silly.</p>
<p>“Okay, okay. I should…rot, I should apologize to Calvaron. I didn’t mean to storm off like that. It’s just when he brought up my past—”</p>
<p>The young man interrupted with surprising tact.</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t worry about that. Calvaron feels he went too far. I think he’ll be the one apologizing when you two next meet. Until then, we should really have a drink.”</p>
<p>“A drink? Here? But they don’t serve free beer.”</p>
<p>If they did, Ceria would already have downed a few mugs to take the burden of the day away. But Pisces just gave her another smile.</p>
<p>“They do not. But there are places where it is sold, quite cheaply too. All one has to do is trade for the <em>secrets…</em>”</p>
<p>He waggled his eyebrows and Ceria snorted.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you traded Calvaron for one of his secrets.”</p>
<p>“Not as of such. I ah, may have told Calvaron that I would intercede on his behalf if he told us the best place in the isle to find alcohol, preferably for free. He informed me of a party that should be beginning tonight. Would you care to join me?”</p>
<p>Ceria thought about it, and then smiled slightly wickedly.</p>
<p>“You’re telling me you blackmailed Calvaron for free beer?”</p>
<p>“He’s not as good at negotiating as he thinks he is, and I do believe he wants to be friends.”</p>
<p>The two began to walk off in another direction. Ceria was smiling against her will and Pisces tried to tell jokes and speculated on what secrets might be worth trading for. She found herself answering back, wondering about the illusion and destruction magic classes, and before she knew it, they were talking again.</p>
<p>Just like on the boat. And best of all, she <em>hadn’t</em> made a scene—well, not that big of a scene—and ruined a potential friendship with Calvaron and Beatrice. And thanks to Pisces, she was going to be drunk, or at least tipsy tonight.</p>
<p>Pisces. Ceria glanced at him sideways as the mage tripped over his robes. He was coolheaded when she was not. And he had a quick tongue and a fast mind. He was also a talented [Mage]; in short, all the things that should have made him the competition for Ceria. But he was also friendly, and helpful. He seemed like a good…friend. A Human friend? Now, wasn’t that an odd thought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A week later, Ceria had gotten used to Wistram’s quirks and peculiarities. She had gotten over the system of secrets, resigned herself to at least one class with a teacher who didn’t like her, and surprisingly enjoyed and learned quite a lot from all her classes. True, she wasn’t exactly learning how to cause earthquakes, but there was a whole basis of magic she had never understood until now. Maybe this was why Wistram Mages were always considered better than other mages; they might not be higher level, but they knew how spells <em>worked.</em></p>
<p>The other thing that the half-Elf had learned after spending some time in Wistram was the architecture of the building. It really was simple, once you got over the varied passageways. There was a general, central area containing dormitories, classrooms, general storage—everything a new student needed. Central hallways branched out or spiraled upwards leading to these individual sections, but the higher levels and the lower recesses of Wistram were off-limits.</p>
<p>There were actual magical barriers in some places, locked doors or Golems standing guard duty near stairwells in others. They were there to stop new students from going too high or too low, where more dangerous magical experiments still ran wild, and the most powerful of mages worked and lived. In short, that was where the real magic happened, but until she got to that point or even became a full student, Ceria was content just to find her way around.</p>
<p>And it was a good thing <em>she</em> could get to places on time, because Pisces certainly couldn’t. The young man had to follow her to get to all their classes, and on a day like today where both of them were rushing, Ceria was just glad for his long legs.</p>
<p>“Are you <em>sure </em>this is the right way!”</p>
<p>“I’m positive! And if you’d bother to memorize the way to class, we wouldn’t be late!”</p>
<p>Ceria snapped over her shoulder as she and Pisces ran down a corridor, running past a plodding Golem made of stone and amused older students who called out to them as they passed by. Pisces muttered as they rounded a corner and went straight down a seven-way intersection.</p>
<p>“Why don’t they have <em>signs?</em>”</p>
<p>“Because that would make it too easy. And being a [Mage] is hard work. Come on, we’re nearly there!”</p>
<p>“Why are we going to class? We just finished Rievan’s lecture a half-hour ago!”</p>
<p>“I don’t know! Cessic just told us to get to the classrooms.”</p>
<p>“Cessic? You trusted him?”</p>
<p>“Has he ever lied?”</p>
<p>“Well—”</p>
<p>Cessic was another one of the new students Ceria and Pisces had gotten to know. He was a Lizardman, and as such, he’d naturally gravitated towards Ceria when they’d been in class together. The Humans—the overwhelming majority of new students—tended to stick together, and Ceria still felt a lurch of anger when she saw Charles and his group strutting around their circle. But the non-Humans had their own cliques, and Ceria had sat next to Cessic more than once.</p>
<p>“Here we are!”</p>
<p>The two mages skidded to a halt and found a large group of students, both prospective and older ones—waiting outside of one of the classroom doors. Ceria blinked. This classroom she’d never been in, and she was fairly certain none of the teachers had used it before. She spotted a tall Lizardman with multicolored scales and edged over to him.</p>
<p>“Cessic! Hey, Cessic! What’s going on?”</p>
<p>Cessic turned his head and fanned his neck frills out slightly as he spotted Ceria and Pisces.</p>
<p>“There you two are! You’re just in time—I think we’re about to get our first class in destruction magic!”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“You’re kidding!”</p>
<p>The two mages stared at Cessic in disbelief. Although they’d taken quite a few classes, they still hadn’t managed to find the class that taught illusion magic (Pisces had suggested that such a class didn’t exist and it was a prank pulled on new students; Ceria had agreed), and as far as they’d known, the teacher in charge of teaching combat spells hadn’t shown up to any of her classes.</p>
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
<p>“Look around.”</p>
<p>Cessic pointed to the other students.</p>
<p>“Apparently, the Council—the leaders of all the mage factions in Wistram—chewed out the mage in charge of this class—told them to start teaching right away. I got the tip-off from Calvaron; he sold it to me cheap, since word spread so quick.”</p>
<p>“Of course he did.”</p>
<p>Ceria sighed, although she wasn’t actually that mad. She’d gotten used to Calvaron selling secrets, and she’d even bought two off him for small favors and secrets in return—one to find out where the bathrooms on her floor were, and another for a shortcut that saved her several minutes getting to the banquet hall each day. Apparently, a rather irate [Illusionist] had grown fed-up with waiting in line for the bathroom each day and enchanted her own private restroom, until word had spread of its existence.</p>
<p>“Who’s the mage? Are you sure they’re coming?”</p>
<p>“Fairly. I mean, if they didn’t offer the class they’d be punished, and I don’t think they’d want to risk—”</p>
<p>Cessic cut off and the hubbub around Ceria died. She looked and saw the door to the classroom slowly opening. She held her breath, not sure whom to expect. What she saw was a tall, older woman—perhaps in her late thirties—stepping out of the room. It was actually hard to place this Human’s age, because although her hair was slightly greying, she had no wrinkles. Her face was smooth and flawless so Ceria supposed her hair was just naturally grey. What the woman did give off though was an aura of cold, both in mannerism and temperature.</p>
<p>And Ceria recognized her, vaguely. She was the woman who’d cast [Ice Lance] on the first day at the Ghouls. She was…</p>
<p>“My name is Illphres. I specialize in ice magic, and I’m assigned to teach you all some spells to use in actual combat.”</p>
<p>The woman spoke abruptly and without any hint of welcome. She raised her voice so the silent students could all hear her. Ceria exchanged a glance with Pisces. This sounded like the introduction the other teachers had given a week ago! And why were they all here? Was she going to teach all the students at once?</p>
<p>Illphres’ eyes swept over the assembled students once. Then she spoke again.</p>
<p>“However, I don’t want to be a teacher. I was forced to take this job by the Council, even though I have better things to do. So I’m going to give you a test. Pass it and I’ll teach you magic.”</p>
<p>So saying, Illphres turned and pointed towards the open doorway.</p>
<p>“[Ice Wall].”</p>
<p>The students in the crowd stepped back as ice rose from the ground, forming out of the suddenly misty air and freezing into a thick, impenetrable wall that sealed off the entrance to the classroom. Ceria heard confused voices as she felt the temperature in the corridor drop so suddenly she shivered. People moved back in front of her, stepping away from the extreme cold.</p>
<p>Illphres didn’t seem bothered by the chill. She was wearing light robes, and she touched the ice as if it were just stone. But she had confidence in her spell as well, because her next words were a challenge.</p>
<p>“Melt the ice. Gain entry to the classroom and I will teach you. Do it yourselves, without an artifact or another mage to help you. That is all.”</p>
<p>Without another word she stepped aside. The students stared at her incredulously. So did Ceria.</p>
<p>“That’s it?”</p>
<p>One of the students, a young Drake, stepped forwards angrily. He pointed to the wall of ice.</p>
<p>“You expect us to melt through <em>that?</em> How? We came here to learn combat spells! Some of us don’t know any flame magic!”</p>
<p>“Not my problem.”</p>
<p>Illphres stood with her arms crossed, waiting for someone to make a move. Ceria hesitated. She knew her best flame spell, [Flame Jet], wasn’t nearly good enough to melt through a wall of ice. Maybe if she had time—</p>
<p>She was too busy staring at the wall to see another student stride up to Illphres angrily. He was corpulent—fat being too general a term. He was wearing robes and by the looks of him he was an older student, given that he was brave enough to call Illphres out to her face.</p>
<p>“This isn’t fair! We’re supposed to be taught by you unconditionally! You don’t get to impose a restriction like—”</p>
<p>He cut off sharply as the temperature around Illphres lowered. Ceria <em>felt</em> it lower from where she was standing; she saw the student’s robes suddenly frost over, and then he was stumbling away, sobbing, his clothing crackling with frost.</p>
<p>Illphres flicked a bit of frozen spittle off her robes as if nothing had happened. She spoke quietly, calmly to the other students.</p>
<p>“I’m allowed to test you. So I am. I don’t feel like teaching children who can barely cast [Light], so this is my condition. Pass it or fail; it matters little to me.”</p>
<p>“Fine then.”</p>
<p>Another student moved up. He was a Dullahan, and his fingers burned with flames as he put his head on his shoulders. He raised both his hands and aimed it straight at the wall of ice.</p>
<p><em>“[Flaming Swathe]!”</em></p>
<p>Ceria watched as a long stream of fire blew outwards from the mage’s palms, licking over the door and raising the temperature in the corridor several degrees. She exchanged a look with Pisces—he looked impressed as well. It was a [Flaming Swathe], a Tier 3 spell, but the student held it for over twenty seconds, which had to have taken quite a bit of mana.</p>
<p>When he eventually lowered his hands, the Dullahan was panting, sweat standing out on his head. He wiped it away with one gauntlet and smiled confidently as the smoke cleared. But then his face fell.</p>
<p>The barrier of ice stood in the doorway, not even slightly melted by the fire. Illphres shook her head as she looked dismissively at the older student.</p>
<p>“A Tier 3 spell. Not even a good one at that; if you want to clear snow, use that spell. For this, you’d better have something better.”</p>
<p>She stared at the panting Dullahan. He couldn’t meet her eyes as he stepped back. Illphres looked around.</p>
<p>“Anyone else want to try? No? Then I’m going.”</p>
<p>She began to walk away. Silence followed her footsteps. Ceria couldn’t believe what she was seeing. Before she knew it, she’d raised her voice.</p>
<p>“We came here to be mages!”</p>
<p>Ceria shouted it at Illphres’ back. She couldn’t help herself. She raised her voice in outrage as the woman turned and regarded her silently.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to teach us, take it up with the Council! But we’ve just started learning, and we need help, not an impossible task!”</p>
<p>A few students around her raised their voices in agreement. More spoke up, and then they were all shouting at Illphres. The woman just stared at them all without expression. She didn’t smile or frown—she didn’t even blink. It wasn’t just having a still face; it was as if her own face was frozen in place. It was so unnerving that after a few seconds, the noise had faded from the hallways once again.</p>
<p>When Illphres spoke, it was in a flat voice as she met Ceria’s eyes.</p>
<p>“<em>Real</em> [Mages] don’t need help. They forge their own paths. If you want someone to hold your hand, find another teacher.”</p>
<p>She turned and walked away. Ceria clenched her fists, helpless, as the blurred shape of Illphres disappeared down the corridor. Pisces patted her on the shoulder, and Cessic said something Ceria didn’t quite catch.</p>
<p>Slowly, the students began trooping down the corridor, not saying much. But they paused when they saw a ten foot high wall of ice right as the corridor opened up into the intersection. The wall left a foot of room near the ceiling, but besides that it was impenetrable.</p>
<p>In consternation, the students stared at the wall of shimmering ice. One student disbelievingly put their palm against it and found it stuck. As the shouting started, Ceria stared at the wall, and then at the mage standing at the far end of the intersection. It was hard to see the woman’s face through the distorted ice, but Ceria could swear she was smiling slightly. Then she turned and walked away.</p>
<p>Pisces stared at the ice as Cessic and Ceria just stood there in silence. He looked at Ceria.</p>
<p>“…How are we supposed to get out?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re going to die here.”</p>
<p>Cessic made that announcement after twenty minutes had passed and the fifty-odd students had made no progress breaking down the wall of ice magic. Over half the students knew at least one flame-based spell, but no matter how they’d pooled their spells and attacked in unison, the icy barrier had resisted all the flames.</p>
<p>“It <em>has</em> to be a Skill! A normal [Ice Wall] spell would melt, however slowly. But this ice is practically resistant to flame!”</p>
<p>Pisces looked as happy as she did. Concerned, he stared at the ice. Ceria just glared. Her spells had washed right over the wall without doing anything to it; and none of the other students still blasting it with low-level spells were having any better luck.</p>
<p>They couldn’t touch the ice, either, or they’d risk getting stuck to it. Several students had already tried climbing the ice, but they’d stopped after leaving good bits of their skin on the frozen surface. Now, most of the students were just standing around and talking, waiting for a higher-level mage to come by and rescue them.</p>
<p>“We’re all going to die.”</p>
<p>The only problem was that some people couldn’t handle waiting. Cessic was pacing back and forth, hyperventilating as he panicked. Ceria sighed and edged away from him; the Lizardman was apparently claustrophobic, and he gave off fear that was starting to spread to some of the other new students.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to die, Cessic. Stop pacing. Just—stand over there and don’t look at the wall, okay? Look out one of the windows?”</p>
<p>“Do—do you think I could jump out of one?”</p>
<p>The Lizardman looked hopefully at one of the windows. Ceria shuddered and grabbed his tail.</p>
<p>“Don’t. It’s a long way down. Just wait, okay? Someone will melt the ice soon enough.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Okay. I’m going to…I’ll just put my head out the window.”</p>
<p>Cessic staggered away. Ceria and Pisces stared at him until they saw he was just looking out the windows rather than climbing out, and then they went back to sitting. In silence.</p>
<p>“I really don’t like her.”</p>
<p>“She does appear to have a most objectionable personality, doesn’t she?”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded to the other wall of ice blocking off the classroom. Ceria scowled and flicked a bit of dirt off the floor. She looked around and saw most of the other students were seated—save for a knot of furious students in robes. They were all older students, a group of five, the Dullahan, and the fat Human who’d gotten frosted by Illphres. They were talking fiercely, and Ceria couldn’t help but edge over a bit to listen.</p>
<p>“<em>We’re</em> third-year students! Illphres was supposed to teach us as well, but the woman doesn’t even respect other mages!”</p>
<p>The over-pudgy mage was talking to the others angrily, and they were nodding as they stayed out of spit-range. The Dullahan was wearing a sour expression as he stared at the ice wall.</p>
<p>“If I had a Tier 4 spell, I could have melted that ice. I wish I could have wiped that smug expression off of her face.”</p>
<p>“Well, if you want to learn it, there’s always the book. If we could pay someone to get it for us, then—”</p>
<p>The older students looked around, and saw Pisces and Ceria standing not-too-subtly near them. They broke off immediately. After a second of scrutiny, one of them raised their voices.</p>
<p>“You two, you’re new students, aren’t you? Shame you got Illphres as a teacher.”</p>
<p>Ceria and Pisces walked over. The other students introduced themselves.</p>
<p>“I take it this isn’t what normal teachers do?”</p>
<p>“Hardly.”</p>
<p>The overweight student snorted. He gestured towards the classrooms.</p>
<p>“Last year we had <em>proper</em> teachers, but this year the Council decided to make the selection process random. Hah! This is what we get. It looks like you two won’t be learning any combat spells unless you pass your entrance test.”</p>
<p>Dismayed, Pisces and Ceria exchanged a glance. The older students nodded in agreement. One of them grinned at the new students.</p>
<p>“Still getting to know the academy? I remember how confusing it was when I was a new student here.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. We still haven’t found where the illusion class is being taught.”</p>
<p>“Hah! Good luck with that. You could get the location from Calvaron, but he’ll change you an arm and a horse’s leg for it.”</p>
<p>The older students laughed again, but the Dullahan paused as he stared at Pisces.</p>
<p>“You’re <em>that</em> Pisces, aren’t you? If you trade me a rapier and a bell, I’ll tell you where the illusion classes are being held.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Pisces blinked in surprise, and then smiled apologetically.</p>
<p>“Sorry, but my personal accoutrements are not for sale.”</p>
<p>“Pity. Well, until we get this damn barrier melted, we’d best save our mana rather than waste it on this.”</p>
<p>With a flick of the hand the Dullahan indicated the ice barrier. He jerked his head and the other students walked away, saying goodbye to Pisces and Ceria. They found a secluded part of the corridor and began to speak intently again, this time making sure no one was near them.</p>
<p>“That was an odd offer, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Pisces and Ceria stood in front of the ice wall, talking. Pisces nodded as he looked over to the other students.</p>
<p>“An offer to tell us where the illusion class was being taught for a duelist’s, that is to say, my, bells. That was the most direct trade I’ve heard so far, I believe.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you should have taken him up on the offer.”</p>
<p>Ceria joked, but Pisces just shook his head. He was very intent as he studied the older students from the side.</p>
<p>“Did you notice his companion’s expressions? They clearly didn’t expect his ruse to succeed, once again adding to my theory that the illusion class is, in of itself, an illusion.”</p>
<p>“Why offer if it wouldn’t succeed, then?”</p>
<p>“For the bell. Another clue. If he wants that for simple directions—well, if the class were so easy to find, it would be a very one-sided deal.”</p>
<p>Ceria raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>“It’s that valuable? That little bell?”</p>
<p>“It is, to some at least. I—”</p>
<p>The young man broke off, shaking his head. Ceria knew he didn’t want to talk about his past, and let the matter drop. Instead, she perked up her pointed ears, trying to listen to what the students were saying. She caught only a fraction as the conversation from other students entered a temporary lull.</p>
<p>“…spell book. I’m <em>sure</em> it has at least one Tier 4 spell in it, but the protections—”</p>
<p>Then the babble rose and Ceria lost the thread. She sighed. More secrets, and this one sounded promising. A spellbook?</p>
<p>Pisces was looking repeatedly over to the group of students as well. Ceria saw him tap his lips thoughtfully, but he didn’t make a move to sidle over. She thought she saw him whisper something, but it might have just been a trick of the light.</p>
<p>As Ceria turned to check on Cessic, she saw a dark shape flit towards the older students. She turned back quickly, but whatever it was had gone the instant she looked.</p>
<p>“See something?”</p>
<p>She shook her head at Pisces and made a face.</p>
<p>“Great. There are <em>rats</em> trapped in here with us.”</p>
<p>“Rats? Are you sure?”</p>
<p>Cessic said that, coming over from the window to rejoin the other two. Pisces frowned as he looked around, and Ceria did too, although she couldn’t spot the dark shape.</p>
<p>“Either that or some large bug.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t mind a bug or a rat if that’s all we’ll be eating. You know, I skipped lunch for this.”</p>
<p>The Lizard moaned as he rubbed his stomach. Ceria was about to tell him to suck it up or go searching for the creature in question when Pisces suddenly called out.</p>
<p>“Hello? Is anyone there? We’re trapped here; we could use some help!”</p>
<p>Ceria turned and saw a tall figure through the distorted ice. It stopped and walked over towards them. Ceria held her breath as she saw a porcelain face, and saw the seven foot tall creation move as gracefully as a dancer. She heard Cessic gulp and the other students go quiet.</p>
<p>Pisces smiled in relief at the stone woman who looked as though she had traded stone for flesh. Cognita’s smooth face smiled slightly as she looked down at them.</p>
<p>“You are Cognita, yes? I hesitate to ask, but we’ve found ourselves trapped, you see. A [Mage] made this barrier and we can’t break through it.”</p>
<p>The Truestone Construct, the Golem who acted like a person, nodded. She regarded the ice wall as if she was staring at a speck of dust as she spoke.</p>
<p>“Ah. This is the work of Illphres. Stand back please, and employ any protective spells you know. I will remove this barrier.”</p>
<p>So saying, she let the students scurry backwards twenty feet before she lifted one delicate arm. Her dress rippled as her stone fist casually <em>punched</em> straight through the wall of ice with an impact that sounded like an avalanche.</p>
<p>Ceria and Pisces gaped as bits of ice showered down around Cognita. She raised her hand and punched twice more, and the wall collapsed. With ease, the Golem kicked the ice fragments aside and nodded to the students.</p>
<p>“The path is clear. I will have the rest disposed of soon enough, although the binding spell has already been broken.”</p>
<p>She nodded politely at Pisces and walked away. In silence, the students watched her go. After a minute, they began to file out, avoiding the jagged bits of ice.</p>
<p>Cessic paused after he’d cleared the broken ice wall. He put one hand against the stone wall, looking pale.</p>
<p>“I think I need to go have a lie down.”</p>
<p>Ceria and Pisces agreed with the sentiment, even if they weren’t so ill as Cessic. They slowly began to walk towards their rooms. Ceria stared at the broken ice, and wondered if she’d ever be able to match any of the beings who walked these halls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two mages were tired after their small adventure, so they had agreed to take a brief rest before going to dinner. Ceria wanted to have a drink to wash away the stress, so they had agreed to find another party afterwards.</p>
<p>The funny thing about Wistram was that while all the mages studied magic, there was always at least one mage <em>not</em> studying and instead imbibing as much alcohol as possible. Something about rigorous and intense concentration brought it out in people, and the new students were only too happy to drink as much free liquor as possible until someone started throwing spells around.</p>
<p>But there was nothing in Ceria that really wanted to have a drink and relax. She stomped into her room, teeth clenched. She’d been in a bad mood all day, ever since she’d met Illphres. Now that she was alone, Ceria could give vent to her feelings at last.</p>
<p>“<em>Aargh!</em>”</p>
<p>She <em>screamed</em> as loudly as she could in her locked room. Ceria hurled her possessions around and then raised her finger and started shooting [Stone Dart] at one of the walls.</p>
<p>“That stupid—arrogant—mold-headed, sun-baked piece of tree fertilizer! That inbred—”</p>
<p>Shards of stone broke as the rapid stone missiles shattered against the enchanted stone. Ceria felt some fragments strike her and stopped as one cut her.</p>
<p>“Ow! <em>Damn it!</em>”</p>
<p>That just made her madder. She punched the bed, and then started ripping the covers and pillows off and stomping on them.</p>
<p>“Real mages? <em>Real mages?</em> I’ll show her a real mage! I’ll—”</p>
<p>She began kicking everything on the floor before she moved on to punching her bed and then a wall. Ceria let out her aggression on anything in sight—she normally found a quiet bit of forest to raise hell in when she was angry, but Wistram was extremely forest-deficient.</p>
<p>She’d always had a temper. As a child, Ceria could remember getting angry enough to burst and then chasing woodland animals around, punching foxes, biting sticks in half—</p>
<p>“Ceria? Ceria, are you okay? I hear noises.”</p>
<p>Ceria looked up, part of her pillow in her mouth. She spat out the feathers and called out, somewhat sheepishly.</p>
<p>“I’m—fine, Pisces. Sorry.”</p>
<p>“Ah, do you want to talk?”</p>
<p>“Um—”</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Ceria edged out of her doorway. Pisces only caught a glimpse of floating feathers and a very ransacked room before she practically chased him back into his room.</p>
<p>“Sorry about that. Did you hear—much?”</p>
<p>“No in so many words. Just…noise. I was concerned.”</p>
<p>Pieces offered Ceria his bed, since he only had one chair. She sat on it, and looked around. His room was different than hers; he had a large bed and an actual balcony on his, but besides that his room was very clear—almost austere. His rapier sat in one corner and Pisces had a few clothes in a pile on one side of the room, and nothing else.</p>
<p>“Nice room.”</p>
<p>“I shall take that in the spirit it was intended. I ah, notice you redecorated yours just now.”</p>
<p>Ceria grinned sheepishly.</p>
<p>“Sorry. Was I that loud?”</p>
<p>“Allow me to say it this way: you were audible through the stone. Was that ice mage that upsetting to you?”</p>
<p>The half-Elf shrugged, turning a bit red.</p>
<p>“It’s—okay, yes, she was. But it’s not just that. It’s just—I thought when I got here things would be different. I thought I’d learn magic, not get involved in petty…<em>politics.</em>”</p>
<p>“I must confess, our entry here has been a bit different than what I expected.”</p>
<p>Pisces murmured as he sat next to Ceria. She flicked a feather out of her hair and laughed softly.</p>
<p>“I guess. I shouldn’t be surprised. But doesn’t it feel like we’re not learning everything we could be? I mean, our basic magic classes are fine, but without combat magic—learning that was the entire reason I came here.”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded, his expression troubled. Ceria let out her breath, giving vent to more of her hitherto unspoken worries.</p>
<p>“And we don’t have that much <em>time,</em> Pisces! If we had a year—or even half of one I could relax. I could prove myself but we have <em>one month.</em> And I don’t know what their exams are, but I can’t just believe they’ll take me because I know a few spells and I’m a half-Elf. I have to be a student here and I just don’t have anything special to offer.”</p>
<p>“Neither do I.”</p>
<p>“Oh come on. You’re the best in our class at our lessons.”</p>
<p>“Best in a class full of new students. That is hardly a ringing endorsement.”</p>
<p>“…True.”</p>
<p>Both students sat together gloomily. Ceria rested her head in her hands, wishing she’d had a real book of spells to study, or that she’d apprenticed under the half-Elves spellcasters back in her village. Pisces sat in his chair, head bowed, apparently lost in thought. Then he slowly raised his head and spoke in a low voice.</p>
<p>“What if there was something we could do?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Ceria looked at him. Pisces’ expression was unreadable, but his fingers twitched and his foot jiggled with nerves. He looked at Ceria and licked his lips.</p>
<p>“I uh, well, you know when we were listening to those older students talk? Before they spoke to us, one of them mentioned a spellbook in conjunction with a Tier 4 spell.”</p>
<p>“I remember that.”</p>
<p>Ceria frowned as she remembered.</p>
<p>“Yeah, they said that. But so what? If they’ve got one—”</p>
<p>“Ah, but they don’t. Have one, that is.”</p>
<p>Pisces raised a finger as Ceria stared at him. He licked his lips again.</p>
<p>“I—happened to overhear the rest of their conversation.”</p>
<p>“How? With a spell?”</p>
<p>Ceria looked at him in disbelief. Her ears were far better than any Human’s and she’d been standing right next to Pisces. He hesitated.</p>
<p>“Something like that. A spell, yes. I’d prefer not to say.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Pisces was acting oddly, but Ceria was intrigued now. She scooted over on his bed as he lowered his voice again. No one could hear them in the room, but both felt the need to be secretive.</p>
<p>“I heard the rest of their conversation. They were talking about a spellbook, yes. A book they do not have. There is a book in a hidden part of the library—in a secret section. The students have located it and they are sure it has potent spells, but the book is warded. If they try to take it, it will kill them.”</p>
<p>“Yikes.”</p>
<p>Ceria’s hair rose at the thought. A trapped book? Wistram had more than one library section, but all the books she’d found were normal books or the lowest-level spellbooks full of cantrips. No wonder the other sections were secret if the books had wards like that.</p>
<p>Pisces nodded.</p>
<p>“I also…happened to overhear where the section is, and how to get in. We could gain access to that section.”</p>
<p>“And look around for other spellbooks?”</p>
<p>Ceria’s heart lifted at the thought. But then she thought of the dangers and hesitated. And Pisces was shaking his head.</p>
<p>“Not just that. If we gain access to the library, too many things could go wrong. We aren’t allowed to read higher level spells as new students, and besides, there could be more warding spells. But if we could somehow obtain that particular book they were talking about—”</p>
<p>“You mean steal?”</p>
<p>The half-Elf looked at Pisces in disbelief. His lack of a response was her answer.</p>
<p>“I have a plan. I hesitate to carry it out, but I am sure it would work. I just don’t know whether I should try.”</p>
<p>“It is stealing after all.”</p>
<p>“True, but—it is not as if these students own that book. It is in the library, for anyone to take.”</p>
<p>Ceria slowly let out her breath. Something was tickling her stomach, the same feeling she’d felt back when she was younger.</p>
<p>“Anyone with the courage. And the intelligence to get it without dying.”</p>
<p>“Precisely. It may not be safe. And if we are caught—well, I doubt we will get into that much trouble. But there is danger, especially if the other students find us as we are retrieving the book.”</p>
<p>“And getting it in the first place.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Pisces waited. Ceria considered their options, and then shook her head. But not to say no.</p>
<p>“The way I see it…we’ve only got a month—three weeks, really. We can either play the good students, or we can take a risk.”</p>
<p>The young man’s eyes gleamed with excitement as the half-Elf smiled at him, showing teeth. He reached out a hand and Ceria took it.</p>
<p>“Tonight?”</p>
<p>“I believe so. If we wait, the other students may attempt to retrieve it earlier. And I can execute my plan quickly. We just need time, and the right moment when no one is around.”</p>
<p>“Okay then. What if we—”</p>
<p>Ceria turned her head, and paused as she saw an irregularity out of the corner of her eyes. She turned her head.</p>
<p><em>Something</em> moved in the corner of Pisces’ room, by the dresser. Ceria sat up instantly. She only saw a flash of grey fur before the creature darted back out of sight.</p>
<p>“There’s rats <em>everywhere!</em>”</p>
<p>She stood up, annoyed more than she was upset. She’d eaten rats before, but she didn’t <em>like</em> the disgusting things. She went to the dresser, but Pisces stopped her.</p>
<p>“No need.”</p>
<p>“Oh come on. Where there’s one there could be a dozen. We need to destroy the nest before—”</p>
<p>“I have taken care of it. Don’t worry, Ceria. We have more important things to do.”</p>
<p>She blinked.</p>
<p>“Oh. You got them?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. I had a small infestation of mice in my room. This one must be a straggler.”</p>
<p>“Had?”</p>
<p>Pisces blinked.</p>
<p>“Have. Excuse me. I must have neglected to round up all of the vermin in my last sweep. It should be of no consequence.”</p>
<p>Ceria hesitated. She pointed to the dresser.</p>
<p>“Are you sure? One [Flame Jet] and they’re cooked. It’ll smell bad for a while, but—”</p>
<p>“I’m sure. I have my own methods of disposing of such creatures, and we mustn’t waste time. Let us go to dinner, and then we’ll begin the plan.”</p>
<p>He ushered her towards the door. Ceria nodded reluctantly, but she stopped Pisces as he closed the door to get ready.</p>
<p>“Just be sure it isn’t a rat. Mice will leave you alone, but some of the nastier kinds of rats will nibble your nose off as you sleep.”</p>
<p>“I have everything under control.”</p>
<p>Pisces shut the door as Ceria went back into her room to clean up in the few minutes before they left to eat. He breathed a sigh of relief, and then scowled as a small shape slowly climbed up his dresser.</p>
<p>He stared at it. The ‘rat’ stared back with hollow, unblinking eyes. It was no rat. It was a mouse. And it was dead.</p>
<p>Pisces raised a finger, and the mouse scurried over to him. He carefully picked it up and tucked it into the pocket of his robe. And then he opened the door and walked into the corridor.</p>
<p>“Ceria? Are you ready?”</p>
<p>“Coming—just got to stuff the feathers back in here.”</p>
<p>Ceria emerged from her room, blowing away some more feathers. She smiled at Pisces and his heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>“Ready?”</p>
<p>“To dinner, then. And afterwards…”</p>
<p>“Let’s go grab a spellbook.”</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This is the story of a skeleton named Toren. He lay on his back, staring at the grey sky. He was a skeleton. This fact was readily apparent to him and anyone who saw him. He was a skeleton.</p>
<p>And he was free.</p>
<p>That was all Toren knew. All he understood, really. There had been a time when he was not free, and he had been forced to labor ceaselessly. He hadn’t actually minded most of his duties, in point of fact. Hauling water, cleaning up spilled food and drink—that wasn’t arduous for a skeleton. And Toren had even liked some of his duties which included bossing about a certain annoying Human girl.</p>
<p>But somehow, even the theoretically limitless patience of a skeleton had been stretched by some of his tasks. Like collecting honey while bees dropped him hundreds of feet out of the air to smash into the ground. Or having to pull—</p>
<p><em>Dingle.</em></p>
<p>Toren <em>twitched</em> once as he lay on the ground, but other than that he lay still. He had to be still. He kept thinking. Remembering, really.</p>
<p>Yes, he had been held captive by the orders. But then had come the glorious, wonderful moment when he’d found a way to escape them! He’d left his mistress—his owner—Erin Solstice behind in the snow where she would hopefully get lost forever or starve to death and thus freed himself.</p>
<p>He was free. If Toren had lips, he might have tried to smile. Since his face was a grinning skull he didn’t have to bother. But that smile would have quickly faded away, again, if Toren had any flesh to move.</p>
<p>Yes, Toren was free. But so what? What did that mean? Toren had no idea. Now that he was free, what should he do? What was his purpose?</p>
<p>Ever since Toren had leveled up and become a [Skeleton Knight], all kinds of new thoughts had begun popping up in his head. Some were useful—like the idea to leave Erin behind so she couldn’t order him about. But others just made him confused. He’d never had to wonder about his purpose before.</p>
<p>Toren was a skeleton. He had been made to fight—at least, to fight in order to protect. But Toren liked fighting. He liked leveling up, so he’d gone out of his way to kill everything he could. And that was good, but was there something else he should be doing?</p>
<p>He didn’t know. If Toren had lungs he might have sighed. But he didn’t, so the purple flames in his eyes just flickered for a moment as they dimmed. What should he do next? He couldn’t just lie here forever. Well, he could, but—</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>Toren heard a voice and didn’t move. He heard crunching footsteps as someone—two someones—walked towards him in the snow. Still, he didn’t move.</p>
<p>“Dead gods. It looks like an attack! Someone’s killed these two people!”</p>
<p>“A bandit raid? Are they still nearby, do you think?”</p>
<p>There was another voice. Toren really didn’t care about the gender of the speakers—if pressed, he might have admitted one sounded male and the other sounded female. He just listened quietly as the two conferred.</p>
<p>“Might be—but look! They didn’t even make off with the money pouch! Here—”</p>
<p>“What are you doing? You can’t just take it!”</p>
<p>“Can’t I? These poor saps aren’t going to use it any time soon, and it’s a lucky find for us. We’ll report the bodies when we get to Celum; that’ll repay the debt.”</p>
<p>“It’s stealing!”</p>
<p>“From the dead? If they care so much, let them stop me.”</p>
<p>Because Toren had no sense of irony, it was only after the man had rummaged around a bit and collected the coin that he stood up. He casually brushed snow off of his bones and walked over to the man and woman engrossed by the two corpses.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>The man noticed something and turned around. He turned, saw Toren, and screamed.</p>
<p>“<em>Skele—</em>”</p>
<p>Toren beheaded the man with one slash and then turned to the woman. She screamed.</p>
<p>“<em>Hemlet!</em>”</p>
<p>Toren paused. Did she mean the man? He was missing his head. Unless he could fight without it like Toren could, the skeleton really doubted yelling his name would do any good.</p>
<p>Still, wouldn’t that be interesting? Toren stared at the corpse hopefully.</p>
<p>…Nope. It wasn’t moving. After a few moments he noticed the woman was running. Toren ran after her.</p>
<p>A fun fact no one cared about was that skeletons were actually light enough to run on the top of the snow if it had a crust. Toren easily caught up to the woman and a few seconds later, he was dragging her body next to the man’s. The blood on his bones and the ground was the only splash of color in the lifeless landscape. That and his eyes, of course.</p>
<p>He had purple eyes. Or rather, purple flames burning in his eye sockets. Toren thought about that as he carefully buried the two bodies of his latest victims with the others. When he’d first been created, he’d had blue eyes. But after…absorbing a gemstone he’d taken from a certain monster named Skinner, he’d gained the power to inflict [Fear] on people. And his eyes had changed color.</p>
<p>Toren didn’t mind that part. He would have gladly turned his eyes any color for the [Fear] effect. But it was interesting to him because the skeleton was by and large immortal and unchangeable in most respects.</p>
<p>He could regenerate. If his bones were separated, they came back together. And even if they were crushed or disintegrated—as they had been once by Corusdeer horns—they would eventually recreate themselves.</p>
<p>That meant that while Toren was very hard to destroy permanently, few things about his nature could be altered. And yet his eyes had changed.</p>
<p>The skeleton considered this detail as he washed the blood off of his bones with snow, rendering him yellow-white and practically invisible against the snowy background. He lay down again and kept thinking as he waited.</p>
<p>He could change. He could be something else. That mattered because…well, because he could level. That was an important thing to Toren. When he leveled, he thought more. And he grew stronger. Both of these things were good. And if he leveled up enough, then maybe one day Erin Solstice wouldn’t be able to order him around at all.</p>
<p>That was a good thought. Toren liked that idea. He grinned as he lay in the snow, staring at the sky.</p>
<p>Someday. Someday he’d go back to that inn with a sword. And then he’d let Erin yell at him and boss him around. And then he’d—</p>
<p>Kill her. Right?</p>
<p>Toren paused, mid-grin. He hadn’t really thought that far ahead. Would he kill Erin? It was the logical answer. But really, Toren only wanted to be free of the orders. He only considered Erin’s death as it pertained to her ordering him about. But what if he could ignore the orders? Would he kill her then?</p>
<p>This was a serious question for the skeleton, and a distressing one! As he thought about it, he realized he didn’t actually know if he would kill or not kill Erin. And that went for all the other people who visited her inn.</p>
<p>The fact that Toren <em>did not have</em> a would-kill list for every being in the world was very upsetting for the skeleton. He quickly made one up as he waited for someone else to notice the victims he’d killed days ago lying in the snow.</p>
<p>They were so handy. Toren had killed the first travelers on a small side road and he’d been about to go on his way when he realized they were perfect bait. He’d used them as distractions to ambush a score of other travelers as they passed by. Not for any real purpose; he was fairly sure that this didn’t help him level up that much. It was just a way to pass the time as he thought deep thought.</p>
<p>It was fun.</p>
<p>Anyways. A kill list. If Toren had the ability to kill anyone—if he leveled up enough, in short—who would he kill? The idea intrigued him.</p>
<p>Well, who would he kill first? The bees, obviously. He’d slaughter their entire damn hive. And then after the bees he’d probably kill…Lyonette.</p>
<p>Yes. Toren’s eyes burned in his sockets. He would enjoy that. She was so annoying, and she’d stopped him from going hunting so many times! Lyonette was second.</p>
<p>And after her, who would be next? Maybe the girl who Erin talked to often. Ryoka. It wasn’t that the girl was more annoying than the other guests that Erin entertained—it was just that Toren didn’t like her. More specifically, he didn’t like her body. Her bone structure bothered him a bit. Maybe it was her shinbones. They were a tad too long, and Toren just disliked that.</p>
<p>Hm? Dislike? Had he just thought that?</p>
<p>Toren sat up in the snow and tapped at his head with one finger. Then he looked around and quickly lay back down.</p>
<p>Had he really thought that? But yes—now that Toren thought about it, he had things he disliked! That was an…odd thing. Before this moment, Toren had never thought about liking and disliking things. But now he knew there were things in this world he hated.</p>
<p>Like Ryoka’s shin bones. And Lyonette. And the bees! And anything that went <em>dingle.</em></p>
<p>Yes, the bells. Toren added the bells and the sleigh onto his kill list. He’d destroy them too. They might not be alive, but he’d find a way. Maybe he’d melt the bells. And set the sleigh on fire. That felt appropriate to him.</p>
<p>Toren was enjoying coming up with his kill list. But he paused as another thought hit him, bouncing through his empty cranium and finding whatever part of him was actually doing the thinking.</p>
<p>If he had something he hated, what did he actually like?</p>
<p>It was an odd question. But Toren understood the word ‘dislike’, even if he didn’t think of it in actual words. But the idea of ‘dislike’ was that there was an opposite, right? If Toren had something he hated, he had to have something he loved.</p>
<p>That was a rule. If there was no love, there could be no hatred. If there was no positive to balance out the negative, the world was simply a void of one thing. So Toren <em>had</em> to have a like or his hatred made no sense.</p>
<p>Right? Toren tried to frown, but the closest he could do was tap his knucklebones against his skull a few times. This was a conundrum. Didn’t he have anything he liked doing?</p>
<p>Well—killing things. And leveling up. But was there anything else? Surely there was. Toren thought hard, abandoning his hiding spot to stand up and pace about in his intense concentration.</p>
<p>And then heard a sound. It didn’t come from the world around him. Rather, it echoed in his mind. It came up from some hidden place in him. A sound. No—not a sound. A voice.</p>
<p>Music.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, the skeleton had heard music. He had stood in an inn, watching a girl sing. He had never known music existed until that moment. And he had heard the words, and they had burned themselves into his soul.</p>
<p><em>Music.</em></p>
<p>Toren’s fist rose. He <em>punched</em> himself in the head as hard as he could, but it was too late. The music was in his head again. He immediately hit himself in the head with a sword to make it go away.</p>
<p>But the music still remained. It wasn’t a sound he could run from, and he couldn’t forget it.</p>
<p>It haunted him. The skeleton had no brain that could decay, no memories that could fade and tarnish with emotion and age. For him, every time he heard the song he was caught in the same moment, listening with wonder and awe.</p>
<p>It was too much. Too much to bear. Toren dropped his sword and <em>threw</em> himself onto the ground. He thrashed about, sending snow flying, getting up, throwing himself on hard dirt again. Trying to hurt himself. Trying to make the music go away. He didn’t even notice the armed people staring at him until one of them cast a spell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The adventuring team stared at the skeleton flopping around in the snow like a fish in silence for a few minutes.</p>
<p>“Is it some kind of rare undead, do you think?”</p>
<p>One of the adventurers, a [Fighter] holding a sword in his hands—whispered to his two companions. They just shrugged, staring at that thrashing skeleton in confusion.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Maybe something went wrong with it?”</p>
<p>“Looks like it. But it’s probably the monster that’s been causing all these disappearances over the last few days.”</p>
<p>“Should we kill it? Or—maybe capturing it would be better? Would the Guild give us a bounty for that?”</p>
<p>The adventurers stared at the skeleton. He was throwing himself around like a dying fish, banging his head against the ground, rolling about in a ball…</p>
<p>Eventually, the mage in the three-man team cast a spell.</p>
<p>“[Pebbleshot]!”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a high-Tier spell, but the bits of stone the female [Mage] levitated up and hurled at the skeleton had quite a lot of force behind them. One <em>cracked</em> into the skeleton’s skull and fractured the bone on his forehead. The skeleton lay on the ground, seemingly stunned, and then got up. He stared at the Bronze-rank team silently. Then he grabbed the sword at his side and ran at them.</p>
<p>Another pebble smashed into his forehead. Toren stumbled back as more hit his arms, his body—</p>
<p>The spell wasn’t really a good one to use on a skeleton. Over half of the stones the [Mage] sent smacking into him just passed through his body or bounced off without doing any real damage. Still, it was annoying. Toren staggered as another one struck him directly in the center of his chest and then he overbalanced.</p>
<p>The three adventurers watched as the skeleton fell backwards, disappearing over a slight mound of snow. The two warriors—a young man and a woman, holding a sword and spear respectively—were ready in case the skeleton charged. But he didn’t appear once he’d fallen.</p>
<p>“Do you think it can’t get back up?”</p>
<p>“Could be. Let’s advance—cautiously.”</p>
<p>The three moved forwards a few steps, watching the spot where the skeleton had gone. They’d gone about six feet when an innocuous patch of snow next to them suddenly <em>shifted.</em></p>
<p>Toren arced out of the snow like an angry bone-fish, slashing wildly as the adventurers screamed and tried to defend themselves. He cut at the mage as she screamed, managing to slice her deeply on one arm and down her shoulder across the chest before the [Fighter] thrust her out of the way. He slashed at Toren while his companion struck at the skeleton from the other side.</p>
<p>“Don’t let it get away!”</p>
<p>One had a sword, the other a spear. Neither was particularly useful in damaging the skeleton, and Toren ignored the few light cuts he received while he tried to hack at the man with the sword.</p>
<p>But the adventurers, for all their poor choice of weaponry, were a team. While the [Fighter] blocked and dodged Toren’s attacks, his friend struck Toren from the side and behind, hitting the skeleton with heavy strikes of her spear.</p>
<p>It was annoying. Toren stepped back as the [Fighter] counterattacked, bringing his sword down in a two-handed cut intended to smash Toren’s skull. He leapt backwards, but a spear struck his spine and made him stumble forwards instead.</p>
<p>“Got you!”</p>
<p>The [Fighter]’s sword slashed out horizontally towards Toren’s neck. But even as the sword touched the skeleton’s neck, Toren’s entire body <em>blurred.</em></p>
<p>“Wh—”</p>
<p>The man’s words cut off as Toren’s own sword slashed at his arm, impossibly quick. The blade cut down to the bone and even into it—Toren wrenched away the sword as the [Fighter] screamed and his comrade shouted in confusion.</p>
<p>[Mirage Cut]. In satisfaction, Toren watched as the man cried out and clutched at his useless arm. One down. He turned to the spear-wielder—</p>
<p>“<em>[Pebbleshot]!</em>”</p>
<p>A stone the size of Toren’s palm smacked him in the head. He rocked backwards on his feet and took a step back to steady himself.</p>
<p>New plan. Kill the [Mage] first. But when he raised his sword, he found that all three adventurers were…running?</p>
<p>“Get away!”</p>
<p>The woman with the spear had abandoned her weapon to help her friend run. The [Mage] was casting [Pebbleshot] at Toren, slowing him down as they ran back towards the main road.</p>
<p>Briefly, the skeleton considered giving chase. But in the end he just shook his head and lay back down in the snow. He was too busy thinking to bother chasing them, especially if it meant being hit by more pebbles.</p>
<p>However, the sudden burst of violence had cheered Toren up considerably. He’d completely forgotten about the music, and so he went back to his original line of thought.</p>
<p>Very well, if he had things he liked and disliked, then what about things he wanted to do? That was another intriguing question, and again, something Toren had never thought of. But now that he was free, what <em>should </em>he do?</p>
<p>Staying here to ambush passersby was losing a lot of its charm. Toren wanted…to be stronger. He wanted to level up freely, like he’d done when Erin hadn’t needed him around her inn. Yes, that was it! Toren would level up. Only after he’d gotten strong—much stronger than he was now would he worry about his kill list.</p>
<p>And on that note…Toren remembered the adventurers who’d beaten him with ease, quite unlike the ones he’d just routed. Griffon Hunt. All of them—and especially the [Scout], the one who’d shot him through the head—were far more powerful than Toren was, he was sure of it.</p>
<p>Becoming as strong as them was a good goal, wasn’t it? Toren stood up decisively. It was settled. He’d become stronger by killing things.</p>
<p>It had taken the skeleton many days to come to this conclusion. But the difference between Toren’s line of thought before and now was clear. Before, he’d just killed to level up, and because he wanted to. Now, he wanted to kill to level up to be as strong as the Griffon Hunt team. There was a huge distinction between such pointless actions and his new goal.</p>
<p>But where should he do it? Toren hit upon his first problem almost immediately as he dug around in the snow. Killing people on the road was all very well, but it was rather slow work, and people ran away almost every time. Wasn’t there somewhere better?</p>
<p>That was when Toren realized there <em>was</em> somewhere he could be. He looked up instinctively, his head turning south…south east. There was something in that direction. Or rather, something called to him, prodded at some sense in the skeleton’s mind.</p>
<p>It wasn’t far away, and it intrigued Toren. That was as good a place to start as any. So the skeleton quickly unearthed the battered bronze armor he’d hid in the snow and put it on. So adorned, he began to march through the snow. He was going to level up! Level up and then—</p>
<p>And then he’d see whether or not he felt like killing Erin Solstice. Of a certainty, he was going to kill Lyonette and everyone else who’d annoyed him at that damn inn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a story of a band of Goblins. They were a dangerous band of warriors—no common Goblins with rusted weapons and feeble bodies, but armed elites. Each one was over Level 10 in a combat class, and they were all armed and armored.</p>
<p>From their levels alone, they were each a match for any Bronze-rank adventurer. But in terms of experience, they were vastly more competent than any greenhorn with a sword. Each of the Goblins was a veteran warrior, one of the best fighters in the Redfang tribe.</p>
<p>And they were being led by a Hobgoblin. With him at their head, the Goblins were more than a match for any unprepared Silver-rank team. They were thirteen strong, a band of Goblin warriors.</p>
<p>And they were lost.</p>
<p>None of them mentioned this fact, however. They walked through the snow, rough cloaks held up against the wind as they marched on in tight formation. They were elite warriors, able to cope with any threat. What was being lost compared to fighting a Wyvern?</p>
<p>The trouble was, it was hard to fight sore feet and the nagging feeling that you were in the wrong place when you should be doing something else. The truth was, this group of Goblins was ill-suited for their task.</p>
<p>Namely: kill the Human. And that was the problem. When the Goblin warriors had been given their task by their Chieftain, the famous Garen Redfang himself, it had all seemed too easy. They’d immediately set out after being dropped off by Carn Wolves close to where the Human had last been spotted, walking on foot and away from the main roads to avoid unnecessary conflicts.</p>
<p>But then pesky questions had begun circulating throughout the group. Doubts that plagued even the most stalwart members. Questions like, which Human? Where was she going? Why an [Innkeeper]? Was there danger? Would she be protected? Was she going to go into a city and if so—were they expected to fight their way in? And most importantly…</p>
<p>Why not tell their current Chieftain, Rags?</p>
<p>All of these questions were pressing and important, but perhaps none more so than the last one. That was because while the Goblin warriors were fine with a little geographical displacement, or even chronological displacement if it came to that, they weren’t comfortable with disobeying their leader. And Rags was their leader, not Garen.</p>
<p>It was a complicated situation. In fact, for the Goblins, this current moment was the most politically fraught time any of them had ever experienced. Normally, being a Goblin was simple. All you had to do was survive, and obey the Chieftain. There wasn’t even a third requirement. That was how simple it was.</p>
<p>But in a strange twist of fate, the Redfang tribe, invincible in the region around the High Passes that they’d claimed for themselves, had suddenly become subservient to a tribe that up until very recently had been little more than a ragtag group of weaklings, even by Goblin standards. But the new, young and undeniably attractive Rags was a decisive and intelligent Chieftain who’d conquered many tribes by force.</p>
<p>Even so, Garen Redfang would have been able to crush her by himself. And he nearly did—except that he’d thrown the battle between him and her. All the Goblins knew it. Garen had taken only part of his forces to fight her, and he’d raided her tribe with quick attacks rather than commit to a full battle except at the end. He’d given the position of Chieftain over all the tribes to her.</p>
<p>That wasn’t actually the problem either, though. Garen was a great warrior and an excellent leader in battle. But as a Chieftain his abilities to manage his tribe were below even a common Hob’s which is why Rag’s sudden leadership had been welcome. Even if she was only technically a Chieftain directing other smaller Chieftains rather than a Lord in control of all the tribes…it was much better than having Garen in that role.</p>
<p>And yet Garen was still somehow in charge, or at least, he acted like it. And he’d told the Goblin warriors not to tell Rags, which was odd because he shouldn’t have been ordering them around to begin with if he <em>wasn’t</em> the Chieftain or if she hadn’t told him to.</p>
<p>It was all very complicated, and because it made the Goblins’ heads hurt, they’d just gone along with what Garen had said. But now, as they marched along and looked for a girl whose name they didn’t even know…</p>
<p>They were lost. None of the Goblins said it. At first, it had been too embarrassing to say. Saying it would have been a sign of weakness, or doubt in their former Chieftain’s orders. They’d faithfully hunted for the Human female [Innkeeper] day after day, keeping silent, maintaining the illusion.</p>
<p>By this point, not saying they were lost was a point of pride among the warriors. As if by not saying it, it would somehow make things better than if they were admitting they were lost.</p>
<p>Still, it was day six and something had to be done. The warriors eyed each other as they walked, and the Hobgoblin leading them grunted irritably. This couldn’t continue. Some of them had mates they wanted to get back to, and others were simply and understandably bored of walking around in circles.</p>
<p>All twelve normal Goblins and the Hobgoblin in charge were male. It wasn’t that Goblin women couldn’t be warriors—it was just that mostly, they were too busy being pregnant or taking care of children. But of the female Goblin warriors that did exist, none had been chosen to go on this mission.</p>
<p>Mainly because all the Goblins would have fought for her attention, including the Hob. And she might have fought them back if they got annoying. And the fighting would lead to sex, and the sex would lead to babies. And before long, it wouldn’t be a group of Goblin warriors wandering around, but another tribe.</p>
<p>The first Goblin to break the unspoken rule of silence was Badarrow. That wasn’t his name of course—the Redfang tribe had no Shaman, so they had no names. And unlike Rags who had been named by a Human of all people, and Garen Redfang who had <em>two </em>names, none of these warriors had any proper name.</p>
<p>So instead they had nicknames, which were as good as names except that they weren’t actual names. The Goblin who irritably made a comment in their primitive language as they sat around the fire was named Badarrow.</p>
<p>Badarrow was so named for his hatred of poor quality ammunition. Rather unusually for a Goblin, he refused to even touch any arrow with poor fletching, misshapen arrowheads, or bent shafts. He was an excellent [Archer] and he had the distinction of having killed two Silver-rank adventurers in battle, although this was slightly less impressive when you considered that he had just sat comfortably behind the actual fighting and taken both adventurers by surprise.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he was a strong warrior and didn’t care for the opinions of anyone else. Which is why he scowled and said a Goblin curse word as he snatched the bowl of watery mush the Goblins had made for lunch.</p>
<p>It was just pasted roots and a tiny bit of meat and bones they’d saved from one of the hares Badarrow had shot yesterday. It wasn’t a bad meal for a normal Goblin, but the Redfang warriors were used to meat meals and lots of them.</p>
<p>All Badarrow said was the curse word, but it was the opening of a metaphysical discussion for the Goblins. It was true that their language was extremely primitive, but the Goblins made up for that fault by reading deeply into each other’s body language and feelings. Goblins lived in close-knit quarters, so their ability to read each other almost bordered on the telepathic.</p>
<p>Badarrow’s comment was indeed aimed at their poor food, but it was also a remark on the person who’d put them in a situation where all they could eat was this. It was an attack on Garen Redfang’s leadership—a subject on which even his tribe was split—and obliquely, a reminder that the Goblins had a better leader whom they were not obeying by being here without her knowledge or permission.</p>
<p>The Goblins considered this comment for only a second. Many would have refused to dive into an argument with Badarrow, but the Hobgoblin, known as Grunter, just grabbed one of the shoddy wooden bowls and downed his gruel in one go. Then he grunted. His name was largely obvious to most Goblins, although some still needed to have it explained to them.</p>
<p>On first glance, Grunter was just burping, or grunting irritably as was his wont. But his prompt, business-like consumption of his meal indicated to the other Goblins that he at least was ready to keep following orders.</p>
<p>That came as no surprise, really. Hobs sometimes questioned their Chieftain, or even fought for the leadership spot, but those who had no such ambitions were always rock-steady behind their Chieftain. So Grunter’s interjection was not a response so much as an opening statement warning the other Goblins that they were still largely indebted to Garen Redfang, despite their current predicament.</p>
<p>The next to comment was a Goblin sitting next to Grunter. He was known as Headscratcher—not for penchant for deep thought, but rather because he probably had lice. He poked his sword with one claw, a reminder of their task. But he also took a bite of his gruel, and even though his had a few fragments of meat, he made an unhappy face.</p>
<p>The other Goblins held their breath. This was a deep statement that cut to the core of what they were doing. Headscratcher had pointed out that yes, they were being sent to kill a Human. Nothing was wrong about that, but it was another reminder of Rag’s relationship to Humans.</p>
<p>Word got around. Even though the Redfang tribe hadn’t mingled long with the Flooded Waters Tribe, they knew Rags was friendly with at least one Human. And she often stayed at an inn. If this was the very same [Innkeeper] they’d been sent to kill, they would most certainly be in deep trouble for doing anything to her.</p>
<p>And Headscratcher’s commentary on their food also pertained to their likely fate if Rags used her power as Chieftain to expel them from the tribe. Garen Redfang couldn’t prevent that, and Headscratcher made it clear that this living rough was not for him.</p>
<p>The next to make a move were two Goblins, Bugear and Rocksoup. Bugear picked one of the infested mites out of his ear and flicked it at Headscratcher, which earned him a glare, but it put him solidly in Garen’s camp. So what if things were hard now? Their duty was to obey.</p>
<p>Rocksoup clearly had other opinions. He’d added his secret ingredient to his bowl, despite the intestinal problems it always gave him, but now he quite deliberately dropped a dirty rock in the communal pot hanging over the fire. The other Goblins scowled, but the meaning was clear: what harmed one Goblin harmed them all. If Rags <em>was</em> their Chieftain, then disobeying her by following Garen hurt the entire tribe.</p>
<p>And yet, Grunter opined with another grunt of displeasure as he fished out the stone with two fingers, Garen had lead them. He’d helped them become the warriors they were, and even if he wasn’t Chieftain, wasn’t he still stronger than Rags? Did they not owe him their loyalty, even though they obeyed Rags too?</p>
<p>Badarrow derisively scratched at his armpit, a commentary on Garen Redfang—he might also have just been scratching an itch. He took out two arrows – one perfectly made, the other one with a single crooked bit of fletching from staying in the quiver. He snapped the imperfect arrow with one clawed hand.</p>
<p>Such a dramatic statement against their former boss quieted the other Goblins. But they knew Badarrow was right. Life had been hard sometimes, for the Redfang tribe. If not for the warriors, then the regular Goblins—there was never enough food, despite their ability to take down almost any monster they wanted. The Hobs had to do all the work, and as Grunter grudgingly admitted, Garen often made mistakes when it came to choosing campsites or places to hunt.</p>
<p>Rags was clearly the better Chieftain. That much all the Goblins could agree on. But the fierce debate that ensued revolved around whether or not her qualifications as a leader made her a better candidate than Garen Redfang, who was unmatched in terms of combat prowess. Complicating the issue was that he had yielded to her, but clearly only obeyed her instructions at his whim, preferring to work behind her back when it suited him.</p>
<p>Could they really go against their leader? And what would be the consequences of throwing their lot behind Rags? Would she protect them, or despise their cowardice in abandoning their own tribe? After all, although she directly led several tribes, the others were simply following her in a coalition. She was not their direct leader—the other Chieftains were simply subservient to her. She was no Goblin Lord. But could she be?</p>
<p>The complexity of such a debate might have stunned any Human who was able to interpret their seemingly random gestures—and even more willing to ignore their fairly disgusting displays while they sat and ate. Bugear was especially hard to watch as he dug around in the ear where at least one nest of insects had made their home.</p>
<p>Most people assumed Goblins were about as deep as a puddle, and that was broadly speaking true. But some puddles are actually underground lakes, at least in certain cases.</p>
<p>The Goblin warriors were, even in their own minds, rather unintelligent and uninformed about many worldly matters. But even if these Goblins couldn’t perform wonders of mathematics or figure out how to read a map, they were still Goblins, experts in the field of Goblin culture in their own right. They understood tribal dynamics, and so they naturally debated such issues with keen interest.</p>
<p>After all, it was not unknown for Hobs or Goblin warriors to sway the outcome of a showdown between Chieftains. And the only thing Goblins had going for them was that they stuck together, regardless of what happened. So their hot debate was precisely the sort of thing that needed to occur to prevent internecine strife, which would be disastrous to their tribe.</p>
<p>In the end, the ones who formed the core of the debate were those who had been first to speak. Badarrow, Headscratcher, Grunter, Bugear, and Rocksoup were probably the best fighters, and certainly the most vocal. So the other Goblins deferred to them as they listened, only interjecting occasionally by flicking a stone at someone or passing wind to mock a stupid remark.</p>
<p>The others had names too of course, but the Goblins had only a limited amount of patience for remembering things. So often, the easiest way for them to think of each other was ‘that Goblin’ or ‘other Goblin’ and so on. Even when it came to themselves. It was only a nickname after all—if they had real names, they would have cared much more. But no one here was that lucky.</p>
<p>The Goblins spent around forty minutes eating lunch, upon which they packed up and kept walking in a random direction Grunter pointed. All the while they argued, until all of the Goblins present came to a conclusion as one.</p>
<p>Their general consensus was this: Garen Redfang was their Chieftain and leader. But—and this was a hard admission—he was a very poor Chieftain. He was unmatched in battle, but outside of it he was about as useful as an arrow up the butt. That was to say, he was actually more of a hindrance than anything else.</p>
<p>True, he’d lost the battle on purpose to Rags. But hadn’t she done a good job beating him and the other warriors despite that? The band of Goblins bore no particular ill will towards her for killing their comrades—they were just glad it hadn’t been them. The trap with the Shield Spider pits had proven she could outmaneuver Garen, and if you added that to her ability to lead so many tribes…</p>
<p>There was no comparison. Rags was the Chieftain, and Garen had forgotten that. Grunter and Bugear put it down to his interactions with Humans. He’d forgotten that he had to obey Rags, not make decisions for her. He had to be reminded of that.</p>
<p>So the conclusion all the Goblins came to was simple: they had to go back. They would go back to Rags and tell her what Garen had told them to do. And then, depending on what she said they’d complete their mission or not. Garen would throw a fit and maybe he’d get violent—</p>
<p>But it was the right thing to do. Their tribe needed unity now, more than ever. Especially if there really was a Goblin Lord about to attack them. Neither Rags nor Garen were as good as a true Goblin Lord, despite their Skills. But if they worked together…</p>
<p>In truth, the Goblin warriors didn’t know why they weren’t joining with this Goblin Lord, as was customary. But they’d heard dark rumors about this so-called Lord, and Garen Redfang had told them that any Goblin who joined the Goblin Lord, he, Garen, would kill himself. Which told the Goblins a lot about how much this new Goblin Lord could be trusted.</p>
<p>That was a matter for later. Right now, they had to get back and throw their support behind Rags. The Goblins present were few, but they had a lot of clout even outside their own tribe. Grunt was an average Hobgoblin, but the warriors present were some of the best, and their voices would sway a lot of minds.</p>
<p>So! Time to go back! No more being lost. They could return with their heads held high. The Goblins all felt rather satisfied with themselves. Rather cleverly, they’d managed to address their current issue <em>without</em> having to bring up the fact that they were lost.</p>
<p>But then Headscratcher looked around at the snowy landscape. He scratched his head, stared at whatever was caught in his fingernails and brought up a dismaying point.</p>
<p>Did they actually know where Rags and the other Goblins were right now?</p>
<p>The Goblin warriors looked at each other in consternation. They scratched their heads, scratched their butts, kicked at the snow, and shrugged helplessly. After a few seconds they all agreed. They were lost.</p>
<p>All eyes turned to Grunter. He grunted irritably. Grunter was a heavy Hob, one of the ones who was classically almost as wide as he was tall. He was no athletic Garen with a Human’s build, but his weight helped in battle where he could use his axe to literally crush his opponents. And it also made him a rock of confidence in times like these.</p>
<p>After a few seconds of thought, Grunter pointed. Not in a random direction this time—he pointed towards where they had come.</p>
<p>Liscor. That was the place to be. That was where Rags and the others had last been—they could head that way. They were sure to pick up signs of so many Goblins moving, even with their pathetic tracking abilities.</p>
<p>All the Goblins agreed. They would go to Liscor. In less than an hour they found the main road heading south and, after walking north for a few hours before they realized their mistake, they stealthily shadowed the road heading south.</p>
<p>They were going to rejoin their tribe. The only problem was that none of the Goblins knew that Rags and Garen and all the Goblin tribes in the area had already headed north, far north to the area around Invrisil. The band of Goblins were going in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>But they didn’t know that. And they felt confident, and that was all that mattered. That was, until they saw the other Goblins marching down the road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the story of a young woman. She had a name. But she had no words to tell anyone her name, even if they would have listened to her. She had lost language. And she had lost her family and everything else.</p>
<p>Before—she had a life. She’d been a [Florist]—an unusual class, but one she could take because her city had been beautiful and peaceful. Esthelm had been a happy city.</p>
<p>And then the Goblins came. The girl only remembered the chaos and screaming—shouting confusion as everyone ran. She’d tried to find her family, to escape, but the streets had been full of dark shapes, and the Goblins—</p>
<p>They had come and gone, and left a burned city in their wake. The girl had survived the fire, and she had been one of the first to lay eyes on her broken home.</p>
<p>Esthelm had been destroyed in a single night. And what remained was—</p>
<p>Rubble. Broken buildings. A maze of fallen masonry and tunnels of homes where the dead lay buried in the darkness. Empty souls wandering the destruction, preying on each other.</p>
<p>If she had found her family, she might have left with them. But no help had come, and the young woman had found herself trapped in the city. The Goblin army had left—leaving countless numbers of their dead in the streets. Goblins had slaughtered their own kind and plundered the city. Perhaps some would have called it a mercy.</p>
<p>But not her. And not the survivors. Rather, the many who survived the Goblin attack soon realized the true horror of what the Goblins had done. The monsters had taken goods, plundered valuables—and stolen away the food. And now, in the remains of their city, over half of the remaining population began to tear each other apart over what scraps they could find.</p>
<p>Death by sword or fire would have been the kinder alternative by far. The young woman had tried to find her home, and then find stores of food—shops—but she had found nothing. Desperate men and women had killed each other fighting over a bag of grain before her eyes, and she had fled.</p>
<p>Now she sat in the dark, broken place that had been a home, staring up at a ceiling held up by crumbling supports. Even though the structure could fall at any moment, she didn’t care. Oblivion was preferable to what she faced.</p>
<p>Hungry. She was so hungry. It wasn’t even words anymore. Just an overpowering desire to eat something. Anything.</p>
<p>It had been six days. Six long days since Esthelm had burned. The young woman’s clean hair was gone. Her features were gaunt. Her stomach was eating away at the rest of her body. She was so hungry.</p>
<p>And yet—she could find no food. Now she sat, staring at the one thing she could find to eat. But it was too horrible. She turned away and lay against a broken wall, trying to die. Trying to ignore the nightmarish idea in her brain.</p>
<p>On the seventh day she stared down at the body. Even flies hadn’t found it yet. Whoever it had been—male or female—had burned in the devastation. Their skin was blackened. And yet—</p>
<p>The smell. It was nauseating, horrific. The burnt flesh should have made her turn away and puke. But now it only made her mouth water. Her stomach growled. The young woman stared at the body, possessed by a terrible urge.</p>
<p>Hungry. She was hungry.</p>
<p>She couldn’t. She would rather die. But when she’d pulled herself to the entrance of her hidden resting place, she’d seen what lay outside. Bands of men—grabbing young women, fighting each other. She’d watched in horror and retreated to her small place, covering her ears to not hear the shrieks.</p>
<p>On the eighth day she stared at the body. She was forcing herself not to touch it. She stared at the ground. She stared at her hands, ragged, dirty. She tried to tell herself it would never happen.</p>
<p><em>Hungry.</em></p>
<p>But something dark sat up in her body. It crawled towards the light, and salivated in the madness of her broken mind. When she heard the screaming outside—inhuman and bestial, she’d smiled and laughed uncontrollably, giggling in the silence of her pit.</p>
<p>And on the ninth day, she’d eaten the body. It was rotten and the flesh was—</p>
<p>She tore and bit like an animal, lost to reason. The only desire she had in the entire world was to eat.</p>
<p><em>She was so hungry it hurt. But then she ate and ate and—</em></p>
<p>And then it happened. She heard the voice in her mind as she slept that night, after she’d puked and wept and eaten again, letting the monster in her soul take over. She ate and ate and ate until her body was <em>gorged</em> on the flesh, eating until she thought she would burst. And then she’d heard the voice in her head.</p>

<p>She’d woken up and screamed. But the sound hadn’t been Human. And when she’d felt at her teeth suddenly sharp and pointed, her fingernails like razors and her face—she’d known.</p>
<p>She’d become a monster. She had damned herself and lost her humanity.</p>
<p>She was—</p>
<p><em>So hungry. So very, very hungry.</em></p>
<p>And there was food to eat everywhere now. So much food.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Esthelm, in the darkness. It always seemed dark in Esthelm. The broken buildings and slanted walls created a labyrinth into which sound and light seemed to vanish. The bands of refugees and thugs who’d established themselves on the outside of the city had light, but it only served to enshroud the center of the city in more darkness.</p>
<p>The sewers had broken in places. In others, the flame had sent buildings tumbling into obscene heaps of death. Only the brave and truly desperate would go searching in these places, even among Esthelm’s survivors. Because even if they did not see anything, they knew dark things lurked in these places.</p>
<p>One of these dark things looked like a young woman. Perhaps. She had ragged long hair and her body was in the right shape. But clothing hung from her thin frame, and as she tore at something on the ground, other changes were clear. Her fingernails were sharp like knives. Her hands and face looked—wrong. And she was eating.</p>
<p>She crouched on the ground, tearing at something. She stuffed pieces into her face, rotting bits of…something. Something she still couldn’t put into words.</p>
<p>Because she’d lost them.</p>

<p>The more she ate, the worse it became. But now she was eating the rotting corpses, not just the burned dead. She was so hungry. Part of her wanted to puke, but she could only eat. It was all—</p>
<p>Delicious. Not like sweets or savory foods to make the mouth water, but something more primal. It was just food she tasted—food to fill the hole in her stomach. So she ate and bit, and chewed the bones.</p>
<p>Part of her wanted to die. But the rest was just hungry. She could stop herself for only a few seconds. And then her head would lower and she would <em>feast.</em></p>
<p>The young woman pulled more of the corpse towards her. It had been a woman, once. A young woman, like her. The knowledge was a dagger in the girl’s heart, but she couldn’t stop. She bit once, and again, tearing off bits and pieces, feeling the flesh rip and stretch. Tears ran down her face, and she choked on bile and the foulness. But she swallowed and bit again.</p>
<p>So hungry. She was so hungry. And she had to eat. Had to. It was that or become one of the rotting bodies. She wanted to be dead, but she couldn’t figure out how.</p>
<p>The girl reached for the head of the half-devoured woman. And then she heard the scream.</p>
<p>“<em>No!</em>”</p>
<p>She saw the movement, saw the blow coming. It smashed into her face, making her nose <em>crunch</em> and her flesh tear as the boot struck her. Then she heard the man.</p>
<p>“What are you <em>doing?</em> Dead gods—what—?”</p>
<p>Then the orb of light in his hands shone on her and she shielded her face. The man saw the corpse and he went still. The young woman looked up, gasping, searching for words. But they had all left her.</p>
<p>And as the horror-struck man’s eyes turned from the body to her face, he recoiled. He went pale, and his voice shook as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Monster.”</p>
<p>He whispered it, and then screamed the word.</p>
<p>“<em>Monster!”</em></p>
<p>She backed away on all fours as he groped around for a weapon, a stone—anything. She saw him find a piece of wood, splintered on one end. He raised the block of wood and advanced, swinging at her.</p>
<p>“Get away—die you—you <em>monster!</em>”</p>
<p>She fled. He chased after her, catching her with one bloody swing on the shoulder once—but he quickly gave up the chase. She looked back only once and saw him holding the body in his arms.</p>
<p>This was her life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They found her as she fled. A group of laughing men, desperate and lacking hope, but reveling in their own twisted freedom to do as they pleased. They only saw her silhouette in the flickering light of their torches, but they called out the instant they saw her.</p>
<p>“A woman!”</p>
<p>“Come here!”</p>
<p>They chased her too. She fled down a broken street, tripping, stumbling. One of them had a Skill and they caught up to her quickly. But the group of men stopped when their torches cast her body into relief. The color drained from their faces as they saw her face, her clothing—when they saw her.</p>
<p>“What is—”</p>
<p>“Is she—is it—?”</p>
<p>They might have killed her, but she fled into a broken place where the rubble had fallen and broken into a sewer. None of the men chased her. Their lust was gone, and only horror remained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the muck and congealed foulness, the thing that used to be a girl saw something moving. She darted after it even as it fled. But it was too slow, and she was too quick now. Hunger and her new form drove her, made her quick. Quicker than the shambling dead things that tried to follow her. She could see them rising in the darkness. The dead coming back to life.</p>
<p>But she wasn’t interested in them. Small creatures were easier to kill. And the rodent she’d found was slow in the sewer waste. Too slow.</p>
<p>She caught a rat and held it up. It struggled and screamed in her hands and bit her, but the pain was just like everything else that was life. And when she bit <em>it</em>, the body twitched a few times and then was still.</p>
<p>She ate it entirely, and licked at her foul hands. It didn’t matter. She was lost. And then she wailed, screaming with all that remained of her heart.</p>
<p>The noise attracted the shambling things. They came for her, rotting, trying to kill her. But she was quick, and she fled. But the dead were coming back, all of them. Some climbed out of the sewers and more dug themselves out of the ground. They were coming back.</p>
<p>Somehow, it made the former girl happy. Esthelm was as damned as she was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A vast army of them, far larger than any one tribe’s worth of warriors was marching down the road. The band of Goblins halted immediately, and fear ran down all of their spines. In an instant, they knew these were not Goblins from their tribe, or even the amalgamate led by Rags and Garen.</p>
<p>The instant the Goblin warriors saw the army, they knew something was wrong. Though the tide of green bodies were unmistakably Goblins and Hobgoblins, there was something wrong about this company.</p>
<p>They were Goblins, yes. But they were not Goblins who followed Rags or Garen. These Goblins wore armor, and all carried weapons. And they marched with death among them and on their blades.</p>
<p>Death, and far worse than that.</p>
<p>Some carried pikes with human and monster parts dangling from them. Others simply marched in place, but that was wrong too. They moved like a Human or Drake army, in formation, not freely like the band of Goblins did. Their armor was black, and they covered their faces with dark helmets and cloth, as if they were afraid to show their faces.</p>
<p>Badarrow snarled as he pointed to the front ranks of Goblins. Headscratcher, Grunter, and the others looked, and saw dead Goblins. Undead Goblins, that was.</p>
<p>Several rows of zombies walked in front of the main army, shambling along. Mostly Goblins, but Humans, Drakes, and Gnolls too. There was a [Necromancer] among the Goblins, or a [Shaman] capable of raising the dead.</p>
<p>The Goblin Warriors had no problem with mages. At least, no problem with ones on their side. Garen’s tribe had no Shamans and they were rare. But necromancers bothered even Goblins. The dead could be eaten or left to rot—or even be used to hide amongst in order to survive. But raising their own fallen to fight again?</p>
<p>That was cruel, even for Goblins. But what was worse was what it said about a Chieftain who would order his [Shamans] to raise the dead. It meant he would use his tribe like things, and have them fight and die for him even after they had died the first time.</p>
<p>This was no tribe of Goblins north of Liscor. Without having to be told, the band of Goblins knew that this was a force sent by the Goblin Lord to the south.</p>
<p>And worst—what made Bugear stop poking at his ear and Rocksoup turn gray with fear—all the Goblins knew that this wasn’t the actual full force of the Goblin Lord. No—they saw no women and children among the army. This was clearly a war band sent out to pillage and kill. And for such a huge one to be sent—how terribly vast was the host of the Goblin Lord?</p>
<p>It was not a question they had time to ponder. The Goblin army had spotted the thirteen Goblins the same time they had been spotted. The Goblin warriors saw Goblins on foot and other riding ponies, and even what looked like <em>spiders</em> approaching them at speed.</p>
<p>Perhaps they thought they were allies? No one had begun loosing arrows yet or casting spells.</p>
<p>Grunter, their leader, made a decision in a moment. He turned and shouted an order. All thirteen Goblins turned and fled up the road. They heard shouts among their pursuers, and then knew they were being chased.</p>
<p>Arrows flew towards them. But the Goblin Warriors had a good bit of distance on their pursuers, so they ignored the shots. Badarrow and two other Goblins turned and loosed arrows at the fastest pursuers—Badarrow’s shot took a pony in the leg and the animal <em>screamed</em> as it went down with the rider. The scream cut off quickly and the Goblin rose with a dripping blade.</p>
<p>The Goblin warriors ran on. They had no idea where they were going or what to do; they only knew they <em>had </em>to flee or die.</p>
<p>That was how they found the city. It appeared on their right side as the road curved towards it, a broken place, the walls torn down and the gates forced open. It was destroyed, but the Goblin warrior headed towards it without a second’s hesitation.</p>
<p>There might be Humans living here. It <em>had</em> been a Human city after all. But even if there were survivors, it would be easier to lose their pursuers among the rubble and fight in tight alleyways then be caught out on the open, snowy landscape where there was nowhere to hide.</p>
<p>The band of Goblins ran furiously, outdistancing even their mounted pursuers by the expedient of shooting down any who got too close. The pursuing Goblins halted when they saw they’d lose their quarry, and rejoined the main army. As the marching army of the Goblin Lord approached the city, a vanguard split off, marching slowly towards Esthelm. There was no need to hunt the individual Goblins. The vanguard had been sent to subjugate what remained of the city, and they could kill the warriors from the other tribe just as easily in the process.</p>
<p>That was how Goblins came back to Esthelm. Some fleeing, others seeking the city out for darker purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The skeleton walked towards Esthelm, understanding more and more as he walked why he was headed there.</p>
<p>It was a place of death. He could sense it in the air. Esthelm had seen hundreds—thousands of lives claimed. And the dead were lying unburied, rotting, forming a mass of—of opportunity. That was how Toren thought of it.</p>
<p>Yes, opportunity was the right word. It wasn’t as if there was any inherent will here. But the dead were gathered so close that magic only had to fluctuate a bit and the dead would come back. It was a natural process, and Toren understood it almost instinctively.</p>
<p>The undead. The skeleton considered the idea as he marched down the empty road, the snow blowing against his battered armor. He knew he was technically undead, but he felt little kinship with the skeletons, zombies, and other creatures he was related to. To him, they were just other things he could kill, or rather, re-kill.</p>
<p>And why not? Toren was sure that he would level if he fought some powerful undead. Perhaps there would be Crypt Lords in the city. The thought of fighting one of them cheered him up greatly, and he ran towards the city instead. After all, it wasn’t as if he would get tired running, and it was faster than walking.</p>
<p>That was how he found the vanguard of Goblins. They spotted him as he ran towards the city. Toren stopped when he saw them. The skeleton didn’t have any real fear in his heart, so his only reaction to seeing the hundreds of Goblins wearing arms and armor was mild surprise.</p>
<p>That was a lot of Goblins. And then Toren had another thought: fighting them would probably be a bad idea, at least, if he tried to do it all at once.</p>
<p>Should he run? Toren was fairly certain that he could get away from any number of Goblins, even in armor. But before he could make up his mind, he saw movement at the core of the army.</p>
<p>Not all the Goblins were armored infantry. Some were riders, others Hobs. And one in the center wore no armor at all. Instead, the Goblin had a twisted staff of ivory bones that looked welded together. And his eyes glowed with a darker crimson than the other Goblins. He gestured at Toren, and spoke a word that was audible even across the vast distance between them.</p>
<p>It was a word of magic, a word in the Goblin tongue, but magic nonetheless. Toren <em>jerked</em> as he felt something in his head.</p>
<p><em>Come here.</em> The words burned in Toren’s mind. He faltered—and then realized the words were like one of Erin’s orders! Immediately, his body turned and he began walking straight towards the Goblin [Shaman]. The other Goblins parted to let him pass, ignoring Toren’s armor and burning gaze. They all wore grim expressions—as far as Toren could tell from their odd faces. They were used to the dead—Toren saw quite a few zombies and some skeletons marching at the head of the army.</p>
<p>At first, Toren was just shocked. He let his body move, unable to comprehend what had happened. How had the Goblin ordered him? But his shock quickly turned to rage.</p>
<p>He was being <em>ordered</em> against his will. Again! But Toren held his patience. He didn’t struggle against the command. Instead, he marched straight up to the [Shaman].</p>
<p>The Goblin was old, and he rode on a cart next to a Goblin seated on a large Shield Spider. The mounted Goblin had black tattoos all over his body and a gleaming halberd. The two Goblins were talking in their own language, and Toren saw the [Shaman] was eying him with some interest.</p>
<p>As the skeleton approached, the [Shaman] turned from his conversation with the Goblin leader and beckoned towards the skeleton. Toren approached, and the Goblin eyed him from head to toe. He spoke several words in his own language, nodding encouragingly.</p>
<p>Toren nodded to himself as well. So, some spell casters could control him? This was an important discovery. However, there was something different about the spell that controlled him now and Erin’s orders. This [Shaman]’s words—the ones that made Toren draw his sword and slash the air a few times and stand at attention—they felt weaker somehow.</p>
<p>Well now, wasn’t that interesting? The [Shaman] waved Toren towards the other undead standing at the head of the army. Toren cocked his head, and then walked.</p>
<p>Forwards, not towards the other undead. At first, the [Shaman] didn’t seem to notice Toren approaching. But when the Goblin leader made an inquisitive sound, he turned and saw Toren walking towards him.</p>
<p>The [Shaman]’s eyes widened. He gestured towards the undead and croaked an unmistakable order. Toren paused mid-step and then kept walking.</p>
<p>Surprising, the [Shaman] didn’t try to run or fight. He just kept trying to recast the spell, which Toren found hilarious. The skeleton walked right up to the Goblin and paused in front of him.</p>
<p>Flabbergasted, the [Shaman] just stared at Toren in shock. Toren slowly raised a hand, and waved it slowly at the Goblin. The Goblin stared at him, and then raised his hand hesitantly as well. He waved it—</p>
<p>And Toren ran him through with his sword. The skeleton ignored the shouts of panic and the cry of rage from the Goblin leader. He just smiled—smiled as he always did as the [Shaman] choked in shock and pain.</p>
<p>The Goblin spellcaster stared into Toren’s flaming sockets as the skeleton twisted the sword. Toren yanked the blade out of the Goblin’s body and watched him fall to the ground, dead.</p>
<p>Good. Toren turned, and the shining halberd cut his arm off. He reeled backwards, surprised. The Goblin Leader snarled at him, cutting through Toren’s bronze armor with ease.</p>
<p>One-handed, Toren struck at the Goblin. But the leader pulled his mount away and shouted an order. Every Goblin in the army charged at Toren—and he was standing in the center of their force.</p>
<p>Oh well. Toren lifted his sword and grinned again. He charged at the Goblins. He <em>cut</em> and <em>stabbed</em> even as the Goblin warriors overwhelmed him. They pierced his armor and broke his bones. But still the skeleton refused to fall.</p>
<p>Only when the Goblin with the halberd came back to sever Toren’s head from his shoulders did the skeleton’s body crumble. The Goblins saw his bones fall to the ground and stomped them into the snow. They stared at his remains, and muttered amongst themselves until their leader snapped an order.</p>
<p>The [Shaman]’s body was stripped of all valuables, and his body tossed into a pile of corpses towed by two half-dead horses. Two lesser [Shamans] came forwards, cringing and uncertain as the Goblin leader ordered them to take command of the undead. They’d gone rampant after the [Shaman] had died, and the remaining spellcasters had to work to keep them in order.</p>
<p>But in the end, the Goblin vanguard set out again. They marched towards Esthelm—but halted several miles away from the city rather than enter it. They had lost their chief [Shaman] through some twist of fate, and messengers had to be sent back to the main force which had continued northwards. Until they could receive reinforcements to control the dead, there would be no point in entering the city. After all, what good was a city of the dead and soon to be dead if you couldn’t control them with magic?</p>
<p>Still, a few Goblin groups were sent towards the city, to scout out how many Humans had survived. Something had killed the first army sent here, and although the city was clearly in ruins, it never hurt to be cautious. If there were still traces of Humans, the Goblins would slaughter them. Shaman or no shaman, they could still prepare the way.</p>
<p>The Goblins waited. And so did Toren. He waited until they were all gone to reassemble himself. He stood up in the snow, dusting off his bones and staring in dismay at his ruined armor.</p>
<p>What a waste. And how odd! Toren was sure these weren’t the Goblins led by that Rags Goblin. So where had they come from?</p>
<p>He didn’t really care. In fact, Toren was privately delighted. Now he had both Goblins <em>and</em> undead he could kill! And Humans too!</p>
<p>He marched into the city, leaving his battered armor behind. All he needed was a sword. That was all. A sword and something to stab.</p>
<p>He was going to level up a <em>lot</em> in the city. But—carefully. Toren was aware that even he could only reanimate so many times. He’d have to ambush the Goblins, fight in the shadows.</p>
<p>That was fine. Toren could see in the dark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the skeleton walked into the city, keeping to the shadows, enjoying the opportunity he had found here. As he did, the band of thirteen Goblins ran fast and as far as they could, dodging into buildings, trying to find a place to hide, to survive the pursuit that was surely coming after them. And all the while they feared what lay in the city. Monsters? Humans? This was a nightmare for them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a nightmare stalked the streets. She hid from the Humans she encountered, and wept as she ate and scavenged among the dead. And the dead rose and tried to kill her as well. There was little left of her, but she clung to what fragments remained. She lived and ate. She survived. That was all she knew. She was…lost.</p>
<p>This is the story of a skeleton named Toren. This is the story of a band of lost Goblins. This is the story of a monster. And how they all met in a city where the dead lived and the living struggled.</p>
<p>Esthelm.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This is a story of a skeleton. His name was Toren, and it was the one thing he had never questioned about himself. Erin had given him that name, and that at least he was grateful to her for.</p>
<p>But in the place he walked, no one would know his name. In fact, they wouldn’t even bother to ask whether he had one. The people in the city of Esthelm would probably just take one look at Toren and run, or try to kill him.</p>
<p>And if they <em>were </em>some kind of mentally-deficient human who wanted to make friends with an undead skeleton, Toren would kill them anyways. That was his plan, and he thought it was a good one.</p>
<p>The skeleton strolled in through the open gates of the city as dusk fell. He didn’t worry about anyone stopping him; there were no guards manning the shattered watch towers, or what remained of the walls. And yet, he knew there were people in the city.</p>
<p>Lots of them, in fact. Toren stared as he walked further into the city and saw what remained after the Goblins’ attack.</p>
<p>Broken buildings. Scorched ash. Piles of rubble and broken earth. Toren was no expert, but he was fairly certain this <em>wasn’t</em> how cities were supposed to look.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe this was how Humans built their cities? Who knew? Toren spotted several…buildings amidst the shattered landscape. He stared, intrigued, at flimsy ramshackle structures someone had built out of salvaged wood and metal.</p>
<p>Were those supposed to be houses? They looked so flimsy, Toren felt he could push them over if he tried. And as it turned out, he could do just that. The skeleton succeeded in knocking over a support beam to one of the structures, which sent the roof and walls tumbling in. He paused as he heard screams from inside the structure, and then realized the noise had attracted people.</p>
<p>People, or to be more accurate, the one species that seemed to live in this city.</p>
<p>Humans.</p>
<p>They rushed over to the building and Toren quickly ran away from the scene of the destruction. He saw men and women in dirty and torn clothing dashing towards the caved-in structure. Crouched behind a broken wall, Toren saw some of them trying to pull away the debris that had collapsed on the people inside.</p>
<p>The building’s inhabitants came out shaken, bloody, shocked. Toren saw with interest there were children—Human children—among them. He’d never seen a Human child before. After a few seconds of observation, Toren concluded they were nothing special. All they seemed to do was cry.</p>
<p>The skeleton saw the Humans—now a rather large group, perhaps thirty or more, exclaiming over the structure that had mysteriously fallen to bits. He saw a few of the Humans—mostly men—begin to point fingers at another man who was raising his hands and pointing frantically at the structure. One man—standing next to a woman holding a weeping child with a bloody shoulder in her arms—raised a fist. He punched the accused man, and then more people rushed to help him beat the poor fellow to death, or at least into something close to it.</p>
<p>It was all fascinating to Toren. He watched as the mob, having administered justice, began to try and figure out what to do next. It was cold, and snowflakes kept drifting down sporadically from the sky. The Humans had to find shelter soon, or at least blankets. There had been blankets in the building, so some tried to dig them out. But then another fight broke out over who should have the blankets, and then someone pulled out a dagger—</p>
<p>Confusion and chaos. This was only one small group, in a small part of the city. When Toren was done watching Humans attack each other, he found another group of Humans to see much of the same.</p>
<p>They certainly did like to fight, didn’t they? They formed into groups or tried to survive on their own, quarreling and sometimes even killing each other over things like blankets, food, weapons—all of which, it had to be said, seemed to be in very short supply.</p>
<p>Toren quite approved of the violence he witnessed as he made his way deeper into the city, keeping to the shadows. He hadn’t ever noticed Erin or Lyonette doing it, but Humans seemed to love hurting each other. Perhaps this was why he liked killing things?</p>
<p>The skeleton knew his bones—at least his skull—was Human. So he felt a certain kinship to the gangs of desperate men who banded together and savagely attacked anyone weaker than them to steal what they needed or wanted. It was so fascinating to Toren that he completely forgot to kill anything for a while as he observed the refugees of Esthelm in their natural habitat.</p>
<p>He’d never seen so many Humans before! Not ever! In truth, Toren had never been to anything like a crowded place before; the closest he’d come were busy nights when Erin’s inn had been packed. But this was different.</p>
<p>There were a <em>lot</em> of Humans. True, many of them seemed like they were crowded together in ramshackle structures, but it did seem like there was some kind of organization happening. The strongest Humans—those with weapons or some kind of fighting Skill—lead the others. They made sure their people had more clothing, more to eat. And they took other things as well.</p>
<p>A man dragged a screaming woman away after one group of men had killed another group of men. Toren followed him as he took the woman away and for some reason, took off his clothes. And then he did strange things which made no sense to the skeleton, but which seemed to upset the young woman.</p>
<p>Toren cocked his head left and then right, trying to figure out what the <em>point </em>was. There was a lot of grunting and animal-like motion…was that it? They were just sort of bumping each other, much to the woman’s displeasure.</p>
<p>Maybe he wasn’t seeing the full picture. Carefully, the skeleton crawled across the ground. It was easy for him to make himself invisible in places where snow had fallen, but it meant he couldn’t see everything. He moved around and tried to get a good perspective from another angle.</p>
<p>Nope. No good. Frustrated, the skeleton stood up. He finally saw what the man was doing—about the same time as the man happened to glance up. He looked up and saw the skeleton staring at him. Toren stared down in interest as the man went white.</p>
<p>Well now, what was this? More fleshy bits. Toren had seen Erin naked a few times by accident, but he hadn’t been aware there were so many differences between male Humans and female ones. And how strange the fleshy bits were! He ignored the man’s horrified stare as he fixed his attention on a rather odd body part that was changing before his eyes. He had no idea things could <em>shrink</em> like that.</p>
<p>The man made a choking, horrified noise as the woman saw Toren. She screamed. He scrambled off her and grabbed for his weapon—a spiked club he’d carelessly tossed to the ground. Toren sneered at it silently. He let the man charge at him, naked, swinging his club without an inch of actual skill or forethought.</p>
<p>Humans.</p>
<p>Toren didn’t even bother with his sword. He wrenched the club out of the man’s hands as the Human struck at him, and then beat the man to the ground with it. The Human took quite a few blows to die, which Toren attributed to the shoddy craftsmanship of his club. He should have been ashamed.</p>
<p>When he was done, Toren tossed the bloody club on the ground. He stared at the woman, who hadn’t really stopped screaming since he’d seen her. It was getting annoying, so Toren used the [Fear] effect in his eyes.</p>
<p>That made her freeze, shivering, naked, and terrified as she sat on the ground, staring at him. She flinched as Toren raised the club, but he just tossed it on the dead man’s corpse. He could have beaten her to death with it as well, but she didn’t seem like she was a warrior, so why bother?</p>
<p>In his experience, there wasn’t actually much to be gained from slaughtering things that couldn’t fight back. He’d tried it with baby spiders, the odd reptilian birds that lived around Liscor, and even Corusdeer fawns. There was just no point to it. It was fun, obviously, but Toren had come here for a reason.</p>
<p>Yes, he was here to fight! The skeleton abandoned the Humans, and indeed, the populated parts of the city entirely. He walked further into the center of the city, peering around demolished buildings. Groups of Humans hitting each other with sticks and occasionally swords was all very well, but he’d come here for a <em>real</em> challenge. Where were the undead? Probably further in. And the Goblin army had to be coming soon. Toren would have a fight then, but in the meantime, he searched around for trouble. There had to be actual warriors around here, right?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Goblins ran through the city, no longer fleeing, but rather, searching for a place to hide.</p>
<p>Their pursuers had stopped at the edges of the city. But the Goblins kept moving, venturing deeper into the ruins of Esthelm. Now that they knew where they were, they were convinced of several things.</p>
<p>Firstly, this city had been destroyed. That was obvious. But what was clear to them was that this city had been ransacked in an odd way. The buildings and indeed the city’s defenders had been put to sword and flame, yet the people had been spared. The instant the Goblins had entered the city they had spotted countless Humans, living in their camps on the outskirts of the city.</p>
<p>The Goblins had never seen anything like it. When they attacked a city or village, they killed all the inhabitants or forced them to flee. But this—taking the city but leaving the people to remain? Who would do such a thing?</p>
<p>It made them all think of Rags. Perhaps she had been here? They certainly saw evidence some Goblins had been here—an entire army’s worth of dead Goblins lay slaughtered across the city, their rotting remains covered partially by the snow.</p>
<p>But maybe it had all been the Goblin Lords’ forces? The Redfang Goblins didn’t know. But they did know they couldn’t stay in the open. Humans being in the city complicated things. Hiding from their own kind was one thing, but if there were this many Humans there, the Goblins had two enemies to fight.</p>
<p>Most of the Humans they passed had formed small groups—former [Shopkeepers] and [Butchers] and so on holding weapons they didn’t know how to use. But if they all attacked the Redfang Goblins at once, the warriors would be torn to bits no matter how superior their equipment and levels were.</p>
<p>So the Goblins warriors ran. The other Goblins following them would come sooner or later, they knew. So they had to find a place to hide.</p>
<p>But where?</p>
<p>The first to spot a likely area was Bugear. He called out as they ran, and pointed to a collapsed building, taller than most structures. It was terribly exposed, but the other Goblins understood what he meant and immediately surged towards it. They raced down broken streets, ignoring the Humans that cried out and fled from them. Lone Humans weren’t their concern.</p>
<p>The rubble was jagged and broken pieces of stone stood out, but the mound was easy to climb for the Goblins. In minutes they were all at the top, staring down at the dark city below them.</p>
<p>They weren’t hiding. Not yet. Rather, they were doing the sensible thing and taking the lay of the land, scoping out the city on their own terms. It was true they would be easily spotted, but who was looking for the Goblins right now? The Humans were disorganized and only a scant few of them had ranged weapons of any kind.</p>
<p>So the Redfang warriors held their position, staring down at Esthelm. Grunter ordered two Goblins – Leftstep and Rabbiteater – to watch for anyone trying to climb up and take them by surprise. Meanwhile, the other Goblins pointed down, their keen eyes catching individual Humans roaming the streets. And the Goblins exclaimed, their voices full of surprise.</p>
<p>What was this? What was this…city? What had happened here? Obviously the Humans had survived the battle, but what was this? They were forming groups, fighting over territory. See there? Headscratcher pointed out a group of men building a clumsy barricade to wall off a street. They were creating bases in the city! And already, some groups of Humans had created living spaces, communal campfires and places for the young and elderly to rest, guarded zealously by Humans who watched over their new home with improvised weapons.</p>
<p>It was startling, strange, unheard of. And to the Goblin warriors, deeply disturbing. Not because it was so unfamiliar—but because it was exactly like the life they knew. To them, it was like the Humans had formed Goblin tribes. They fought and warred over resources like Goblins did, only viciously, fighting over petty scraps that even the Goblin tribes wouldn’t have contested.</p>
<p>If too many tribes were in the same region, they would fight. But the weaker tribe would move away rather than continue to fight. But none of the Humans left the city. They warred over it instead, building a new place on the ashes of their homes. It was so surreal to them that the Goblin warriors had to stop and take it all in.</p>
<p>And the cruelty! Ah, Goblins knew Humans could be cruel. But when they saw the other Humans killing each other in the streets, chasing after women, hurting—the Goblins saw a bit of what they did, and felt uneasy. It was too much like what Goblins were supposed to do. Not Humans.</p>
<p>Of course, not all Humans had become raping, murderous monsters. But it had to be said that the ones who did this tended to stand out a lot more than the ones just trying to survive. The Goblins stood on their position for a few minutes, and after they were able to tear their eyes away from the Humans, they took in the rest of the city.</p>
<p>The places near the walls were the most populated. Only naturally—the destruction was actually less around the outskirts, since there weren’t as many buildings that could have been destroyed. But in the center, a great pile of broken walls and stone formed a maze, a labyrinth that ran into the earth in places where the underground sewers had collapsed and sent the ground tumbling downwards.</p>
<p>That was a good place to hide. But for how long? At Grunter’s insistence, the Goblins checked their supplies. They weren’t carrying much. Aside from their weapons and tools to start fires and hunt and prepare food with, they had barely enough for a scant meal between them. If they wanted to live in this city, they’d have to find food.</p>
<p>Well, there were dead bodies. Badarrow pointed out some fresh ones. And there were Humans as well as Goblins for variety. Grunter nodded, but his eyes were on a few pinpoints of light beyond the city walls. The other Goblins looked.</p>
<p>Campfires. And they could see small shapes, hundreds of them, gathered around the fires. Goblins. Not their people, but the enemy.</p>
<p>Why were they here? It didn’t matter. They’d boxed the Redfang Goblins into the city, and if they tried to run, they’d surely be cut down.</p>
<p>It was bad news. But the Goblins <em>were</em> Goblins, so they regarded their predicament as only another thing to survive. That was why they moved off the rubble and into the heart of the city without worrying or speaking. Shelter first, and then food. Worrying was pointless; a thing Chieftains did.</p>
<p>On their passage through the streets, the Goblins slowed. Now that they weren’t running, they let their most silent trackers—Badarrow and Numbtongue—go ahead. Numbtongue peered down an alley and shook his head. The Goblins swiftly passed by the entrance, avoiding the group of Humans at the other end.</p>
<p>Fighting was pointless. The Goblins knew how to fight, which meant they knew when not to fight. They avoided any groups of Humans, slowly working their way deeper and deeper through the streets.</p>
<p>That’s when they saw the Human and the child. He was calling out, searching for his family. The Goblins heard his voice and said nothing, although they all privately knew where the child’s parents likely were. Hadn’t they all gone through the same moments growing up, after a battle or when their tribe had been raided?</p>
<p>Grunter wanted to move on, but Headscratcher pointed. The Goblins, hidden as they crouched in a shadowy spot next to a building, saw a man approaching the child. He had no weapon, but there was murder in the way he walked.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was tired of hearing the child call out. Maybe he thought the child would attract too much attention here. He might have been angry, or filled with hate. Maybe he just wanted to kill something.</p>
<p>The boy ran when he saw the adult. But he was too slow. The man grabbed him. The Goblins watched, remembering. It was a familiar scene. Still, they didn’t move. They would have left, to let the scene play out, but Badarrow stood up. Silently, he put an arrow to his bow and loosed it.</p>
<p>Badarrow’s shot took the Human in the back, right where neck met shoulder. The man gasped, fell, nearly squashing the shocked boy who cried out. He was dead when he hit the ground.</p>
<p>None of the other Goblins said a word. But neither did they rebuke Badarrow. And neither did they look at the child. They just paused, and moved on.</p>
<p>The wandering child screamed as he saw the Goblins, but the warriors moved past him, grim and silent. They gave him no aid, but didn’t hurt him. He was Human. An enemy if he was older, prey if he had valuables they could take. What could they have done for him, anyways?</p>
<p>But the Redfang warriors exchanged glances even so, as they found likely spots to settle and scouted around for any fresh bodies and wood to use for dinner. They didn’t say it, but they all thought it.</p>
<p>There was something dark in this city. Of course, they’d seen things far more terrifying than this, and they’d faced times just as bleak. But it was what the Humans did that disturbed the Goblins. When things fell apart, they didn’t stick together like Goblins did—they tore each other apart. Hadn’t they all been part of the same tribe here? Why were they killing each other now?</p>
<p>No one had an answer. But Grunter, who’d been staring at the sky, grunted. The Goblins looked at him as they pulled the Human that Badarrow had shot back towards their new base. The boy was long gone.</p>
<p>Grunter pointed the direction they’d come, back towards the other Goblins. He spoke, the words coming slowly to him.</p>
<p><strong>“The others will come. Here. To kill the Humans.”</strong></p>
<p>The Redfang warriors nodded. That was likely. They could put two and two together—even if this city had been looted, the Humans were a resource. Food, and perhaps even warriors if the [Shamans] and [Mages] they’d seen could control so many.</p>
<p>But what did that have to do with them? Grunter pointed at the broken walls, the maze the Goblins found himself in. He touched the axe at his belt.</p>
<p><strong>“Chaos. Confusion. Kill them.”</strong></p>
<p>The Goblin warriors considered this. Then Bugear grinned and Rocksoup licked his lips. Now, <em>that</em> was a good idea! It was unlike Grunter to come up with it, but he was a Hob after all.</p>
<p>Kill their kind. Ambush them in the streets. Even if there was an army, it wasn’t impossible in this landscape. The city practically invited sneak attacks. And in the confusion and looting and killing, they could surely slip away from their pursuers.</p>
<p>After all, Goblins looked alike. And if they could get their hands on some armor—who’d notice a band of Goblins amidst all the fighting?</p>
<p>It was a good plan, and the Goblins wasted no more time thinking about it. They had a plan, and they would implement it as best they could. Now it was time to eat. They had one body—they could find more, and stuff themselves tonight.</p>
<p>That was one small benefit to be had from this city. There were a lot of bodies, and Humans didn’t eat dead Humans. So the Goblins would be fed, and warm too, if they could find enough wood. All they had to do was find a place to hide.</p>
<p>And wait.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toren was getting sick of all the useless Humans. He was tempted to just run at a band of looters and fight them, but he had the feeling he wouldn’t level if he did. He strode down the empty streets, growing increasingly more annoyed.</p>
<p>Where was the backbone in these Humans? It seemed like all they were doing was squabbling with each other, not doing important things! Perhaps that was why the Goblin army had come. They would easily kill the Humans.</p>
<p>Already the Goblin army outside the gates had been noticed. Toren saw many Humans abandon their camps and move into the city, afraid, fighting to get to a spot they considered safer. But that just meant they were fighting themselves again.</p>
<p>So stupid. Part of Toren missed the inn. Just a small part. He immediately quashed the thought when he had it, but wasn’t it true? At least in the inn he had things to do. Here he was looking and he still couldn’t find something worthwhile to kill. Whereas at the inn—</p>
<p>He could scrub the floors. And serve food. And that would level up his [Barmaid] class. It was…well, it wasn’t as if Toren <em>liked </em>the class. But he liked leveling up. And here he had nothing much to do.</p>
<p>Toren was just considering going for broke and slaughtering everything he could when he heard the fighting. He turned, and saw a group of five men and two women, cornering a family. A man slashed at the other men with a short sword while he tried to guard his wife and two daughters. But the other men had clubs and sticks, and even if they weren’t as sharp, there were a lot of them.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the sword they were after. But Toren had a feeling the three females were also part of it. He was starting to figure out Human motivations, even if he didn’t quite get the details.</p>
<p>Well, here was a fight. Perhaps Toren should join in—kill them all. The skeleton lifted his blade, ready to charge. But then he heard a shout. He saw someone run down the street, someone tall. In <em>armor? </em>Toren stepped back into a shadow as the men turned. He caught a glimpse of silver, flashing in the darkness. And then he saw the adventurer.</p>
<p>A tall man, blonde, wearing plate armor and holding a shield and sword that gleamed, charged down the snowy, dirty street. He was followed by three other adventurers, a man and two women Toren recognized. The [Fighter], the spear wielder, and the annoying mage! But these three were clearly different from the man in silver armor. Their equipment was cheap, if effective. But this man’s armor <em>gleamed.</em></p>
<p>And he moved faster than Toren would have guessed. In seconds he’d covered the distance between the thugs. He raised his sword as they turned, shouting in shock. Toren heard his voice, filled with outrage clearly across the street.</p>
<p>“You <em>scum!</em>”</p>
<p>He ran one man through and lopped the hand off of the other before the group of men could even blink. He turned, slashing, making the other Humans cry out in pain. The two women in the band of thugs weren’t spared from his wrath either. Within moments the entire group had fled. The only people that remained were the family that had been set upon.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?”</p>
<p>Toren heard the words as he stealthily made his way closer to the man in armor. He was standing, reassuring the tearful family as the other three adventurers stood behind him awkwardly. They hadn’t even gotten there in time to help!</p>
<p>“Bless you, sir. I don’t know what would have happened if you hadn’t come—”</p>
<p>The father was speaking to the adventurer. And yes, Toren was sure he was an adventurer. He had pouches at his belt, and he reminded Toren a lot of the Horns of Hammerad and Griffon Hunt.</p>
<p>“It was my duty. But you shouldn’t be out so late. Why haven’t you fled the city?”</p>
<p>“Where would we go, sir? There are Goblins on the road. And—they came back!”</p>
<p>The woman clutched at the Knight, speaking desperately and pointing. Toren knew she had to be talking about the Goblin army.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t leave. Going to another city after the Goblins attacked? In the cold, with nothing to eat or wear? We couldn’t. And then—we stayed. We thought we’d survive, but there are gangs roaming the streets, sir. We barely got away when the people we were with were attacked last time. And now…”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>The man’s voice was firm, quiet. He looked at the adventurers following him.</p>
<p>“You three. We’ll need to escort these good people to a safe place.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The Bronze-rank adventurers exclaimed in dismay. The man with the sword—whom Toren was displeased to note had healed the injuries the skeleton had given him—spoke to the adventurer in silver armor.</p>
<p>“Sir, we can’t just involve ourselves here! We should be leaving for another city! Take the family with us maybe, but those Goblins chased us into the city! They’ll probably attack at any moment!”</p>
<p>The man in armor glared at the [Fighter], but the woman with the spear piped up as well, looking nervous.</p>
<p>“But we can’t leave! The Goblins have the road. And there’s the skeleton we saw! The strange one! If we leave, we might run into it!”</p>
<p>“Fools. The dead are <em>rising! </em>Of course there are skeletons wandering the roads!”</p>
<p>The warrior in armor snapped at the others. They stopped, looking confused.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Why are the dead rising?”</p>
<p>He stared at them incredulously. Toren was giving them much the same look from his hiding spot, in a small place where the cobblestones had been torn up to create a small depression. The man in silver armor sighed and spoke through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“Rookies. Haven’t you learned anything? Violence and anarchy in the street are but one of Esthelm’s woes. This place was the site of a major battle where thousands died, both Goblins and Humans. You’ve seen the bodies. Don’t you know what happens when they aren’t properly buried or cremated?”</p>
<p>“They rise.”</p>
<p>That came from the female [Mage]. She looked pale faced. The adventurer nodded.</p>
<p>“They rise. First zombies, then skeletons and even Ghouls if the slaughter is great enough. Given time, stronger undead will emerge as well. Crypt Lords…and far worse.”</p>
<p>A groan of pure terror came from the family the man had saved. The father fell to his knees, beseeching.</p>
<p>“Mister Adventurer, sir! Can you not save us? If the undead rise—what chance do my family and I have?”</p>
<p>“Calm yourself. The issue of the undead is precisely the reason I came here.”</p>
<p>The man in armor helped the father up, speaking reassuringly to the family.</p>
<p>“I am a Gold-rank adventurer. I heard of what had befallen Esthelm too late, but I set out as soon as I realized the other local cities were doing nothing to address the issue. The fools in the Adventurer’s Guild were too afraid to venture out, even the Silver-ranked ones.”</p>
<p>Toren’s metaphorical ears perked up the instant he heard the adventurer mention his rank. Gold? Toren had seen Griffon Hunt and even the other team—the Halfseekers, but he’d never properly fought one before. The closest he’d come was fighting Halrac, and that had been completely one-sided.</p>
<p>But here…this adventurer was alone! Toren immediately wanted to challenge him, but he held off. Listen. Observe. He wriggled closer, moving slowly so as not to be seen. The Gold-rank adventurer was addressing everyone, his back turned to Toren.</p>
<p>“I came here to deal with the undead issue because no one else had the courage to make the journey. But instead I find a city’s worth of people here, as well as a Goblin army?”</p>
<p>The man in silver armor paused. He shook his head.</p>
<p>“This all feels too connected. If what I suspect is true, the Goblins may have spared the people of this city for this moment. So many bodies, and so much potential for death—are they trying to create an undead horde to attack other cities with?”</p>
<p>“An undead horde? Could the Goblins really do such a thing?”</p>
<p>“Normal armies do it as well, I’m afraid, Miss. I’d like to say I could drive off the Goblins myself, but there are hundreds out there and I’m no Named Adventurer. Still, I think there’s a way. If I can—”</p>
<p>He was so full of himself! So proud. So…why was Toren angry? But this seemed too easy. The skeleton was only a few feet away. He could use [Mirage Cut] and take the man down in seconds. Was this really a Gold-rank adventurer? How could one be so careless? But still, Toren would do it. He wanted the man’s silver armor, not to mention his sword and shield.</p>
<p>Closer. Closer…Toren rose slowly, and moved at a crouch. None of them were looking at him! They all had their eyes on the armored man! Toren’s hand was on his sword hilt. He didn’t even have a scabbard. He could run the man through—</p>
<p>One of the daughters who’d been staring in horror and hope at the Gold-rank adventurer sneezed in the cold. She looked down for something to cover her nose, saw Toren. She screamed.</p>
<p>“<em>Skeleton!</em>”</p>
<p>The Gold-rank adventurer turned. He saw Toren and his eyes widened. His sword rose, but too late. The skeleton leapt at him, and his body <em>blurred. </em>His sword flashed out, but that was a decoy. Even if the adventurer parried it, he’d still take the man’s head. Who walked around in armor but didn’t wear a helmet?</p>
<p>Idiot. Toren’s sword scythed towards the man’s head at lightning speed. [Mirage C—</p>
<p>“[Shield Breaker]!”</p>
<p>The shield pushed forwards, almost glowing. It filled Toren’s vision, and then struck the skeleton like a house. The skeleton flew backwards, stumbling, nearly falling over. What happened? His Skill! How did—</p>
<p>The Gold-rank adventurer lowered his shield and stared at Toren, eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“What manner of skeleton sneaks and hides? And uses a Skill?”</p>
<p>Toren readjusted his crooked head and grinned at the Gold-rank adventurer. He hadn’t known someone could interrupt a Skill! His eyes flashed purple, and the Humans behind the adventurer screamed.</p>
<p>“Dead gods! It’s back!”</p>
<p>“<em>Run!</em>”</p>
<p>The [Fear] effect made them all scatter at once. The man in armor called out, trying to slow them, but the others didn’t listen. They ran, leaving the adventurer behind.</p>
<p>Perfect. Toren charged at the man as he turned and shouted. The skeleton brought the blade down two-handed in a vertical slash that should have split the man’s head open. But the blade <em>twisted</em> in the air a foot away from the man’s head. It curved left and Toren missed completely, striking the man’s armored shoulder!</p>
<p>What was that? Magic? It had to be. Toren gaped and then a sword pierced his ribcage effortlessly.</p>
<p>“Hmf. A spell-like effect? You aren’t a normal undead monster, are you?”</p>
<p>The Gold-rank adventurer cut sideways, and Toren staggered as several ribs on his left side were torn away. But that was just a few bones! He cut again, but this time his sword bounced off the silvery shield, not even scratching the metal.</p>
<p>“A revenant? Or some kind of Goblin creation? Either way—begone.”</p>
<p>Now the man in silver armor charged forwards, his shield ramming into Toren. The skeleton tried to stand his ground, but he was thrown by the incredible force behind the adventurer’s shield. He hit the ground, rolled, trying to get up—</p>
<p>A sword lopped the top off of his head. Toren collapsed, his bones rolling on the ground. The Gold-rank adventurer stared down at him, murmuring to himself.</p>
<p>“Nothing about this makes sense. A skeleton that can think? No—the Necromancer? But why would he use such an inferior creation?”</p>
<p>Inferior? If Toren could have said anything—or moved—he would have been indignant. But he lay on the ground, waiting for the adventurer to leave before he reassembled himself. He was clearly not as strong as that warrior, either in experience or strength.</p>
<p>“One more question to ask later. Damn. Where did the others run off to? Well before that—I should dispose of the remains.”</p>
<p>So saying, the adventurer reached towards his belt pouch. Immediately, Toren began to panic.</p>
<p>Dispose of him? What was that? He—that wasn’t fair! No one was supposed to care about Toren after a fight! That was his specialty. If the adventurer was going to destroy him—</p>
<p>From the ground, the skeleton could only stare helplessly as the man reached into his pouch. But before the Gold-rank adventurer could take whatever was in there out, the skeleton heard pounding footsteps. The man in silver armor turned—</p>
<p>And nearly caught a blow to the head from a club. At the last moment the piece of wood swerved, just as it had done with Toren. But the blow still knocked the off-guard adventurer down.</p>
<p>“What the—?”</p>
<p>He rose, shield up, but another man struck him from behind. Toren gaped as he saw more men swarm the Gold-rank adventurer, beating at him with clubs, kicking, trying to pin him down—</p>
<p>It was a gang! And they were trying to kill the adventurer! Toren had never been more grateful to petty Humans in his life. He heard the man shout, and then saw the press of bodies fly backwards. Several stumbled back, and the man in armor was on his feet, swinging his sword and shield to keep them at bay.</p>
<p>“<em>Cowards! </em>Are you insane? I’ve come here to—”</p>
<p>He got no further. Stones, and even an arrow flew at his head. Men with slings aiming at his head! Again the missiles flew askew, but whatever magic was protecting the man’s head was clearly weakening. He snarled, deflected a stone aimed at his jaw—</p>
<p>And staggered, as a club smashed into his head from behind. Toren saw the man pull back and hit the adventurer in the same spot again, with all his might.</p>
<p>It was a powerful blow. But the man in silver armor didn’t fall. He stumbled forwards, but he refused to kneel or drop. Instead, his shield came up, hitting the man who’d struck him so hard he gasped and stumbled back.</p>
<p>“Fool.”</p>
<p>It was one word, but it was louder than the shouting of the gang as they tried to close in. A man ran at the knight—a sword came up even with the man’s head still bowed. It ran the man through.</p>
<p>“<em>Fools!</em>”</p>
<p>The gang stopped. The sword left the man’s chest and he collapsed, dead. The knight turned. A stone flew at his head and his shield snapped up. He deflected the stone <em>back</em> at the man who’d loosed it from his sling. The rock hit the man and there was a cry of pain.</p>
<p>Now the Gold-rank adventurer finally looked up. He raised his head slowly, the tendons in his neck straining. Blood ran and matted in his hair, but he turned and stared down the man who’d struck him. The sword shone bright and silver and crimson in his hands, but the adventurer didn’t raise his weapon.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, you <em>idiot?</em>”</p>
<p>The thug he addressed stepped back, eyes wide. The man in silver armor turned towards him, and the man raised his club defensively. But one armored hand shot out and tore the weapon out of the other man’s grip.</p>
<p>“No—”</p>
<p>Flinching, the man raised his hands, prepared for death. But the adventurer just hurled the club to the ground. He stared at the other men who’d ambushed him. Fury burned in his voice as he shouted at them.</p>
<p>“Is this what you are? You—you, the men of Esthelm! I came here to this burned city to put your dead to rest. But what do I find? Men, preying on each other like vermin! Have you no <em>shame?</em> Where’s your pride? Where is your honor?”</p>
<p>He turned around to the stunned group, armor glinting as he stared each one of them in the eye. The Gold-rank adventurer didn’t even seem to notice their arms—rather, it was as if he didn’t even care that he was outnumbered.</p>
<p>“There are women and children—people who suffer and need help! Your friends and family cry out in this city, but what do you do? The instant your walls fall you turn on them. Shame.”</p>
<p>The word touched the hearts of his listeners. It made them feel ashamed, and angry and guilty as well. Perhaps they would have rushed him, but the man in armor was too imposing. And his words struck at their hearts, the hearts they’d closed in despair.</p>
<p>The man wearing silver looked around in disgust. He lowered his sword—and to the astonishment of the other men, sheathed it. He walked towards several men. They raised their weapons, but he just stopped and glanced at them, still full of that barely restrained passion.</p>
<p>“Lower your weapons and follow me if you want to save this city, you fools.”</p>
<p>They hesitated. Two hands shot out and tore the makeshift weapons and poor swords from their grip. The Gold-ranked adventurer stared down at the other men and raised his voice.</p>
<p>“I am Ylawes Byres, a [Knight]. I am a Gold-rank adventurer and I can save this city. But I cannot do it alone. If you still believe in Esthelm—follow my back.”</p>
<p>He strode down the broken streets, not looking back. The men hesitated. Some lowered their weapons and turned to go. But the man who had struck Ylawes picked up his club. He hung it at his belt and ran after the adventurer.</p>
<p>More men followed him. They joined the Gold-rank adventurer, and he snapped at them as he’d never doubted they’d be there.</p>
<p>“Come on. There’s still time to do what’s right.”</p>
<p>The man’s footsteps faded away. The majority of the men followed him, while the others slipped away. After a few minutes, a pile of bones reassembled itself in the snow. Toren stood up, grabbed his sword, and stared in the direction the man named Ylawes had gone.</p>
<p>Now what was all <em>that</em> about?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The monster waited, hungry. She was always hungry. Her story was one of despair and all-consuming desire. To eat. To feed.</p>
<p>She saw a thing crawl out of the sewers. A dead woman, corpse bloated and rotten. She told herself she didn’t want to eat it. But she did. Oh yes, she did.</p>
<p>The zombie shambled down the street. The monster who looked vaguely like a young Human woman followed her. The zombie moved quickly—stumbling, searching out food. It never noticed her.</p>
<p>And it found prey. A young man slept in the hollowed-out building that might have been his home. He would have been safe, hidden from most Humans. But not from a zombie. It found him as it wandered in, and fell upon him.</p>
<p>The monster heard the screams, and part of her told her to act. It wasn’t hard. She simply gave into her desires.</p>
<p>The zombie was biting and clawing at the young man on the ground. He was trying to fend her off, but he was barely awake, and weak with hunger. And the dead woman had far more strength than he did. She was biting at him—tearing at his flesh.</p>
<p>Just like she wanted to do. But the girl that was a monster focused on the zombie instead. Yes. Hungry. The gray, rotted flesh called to her.</p>
<p>For once she didn’t fight the urge. She wanted to eat. The monster girl walked behind the zombie and seized the dead woman. The undead turned, reaching out to kill, to steal life—</p>
<p>Did it hesitate? It stared into a gaping maw. The monster girl’s mouth. Her jaws opened wide—impossibly wide—and she felt her jaw dangling far lower than it should. But it just meant she could <em>bite</em> more.</p>
<p>She bit the zombie’s face. She tore away rotted flesh easily, teeth scissoring through skin like parchment. The zombie made a sound—tried to tear at her body. But the girl had a monster’s body now. An Eater’s form. Her skin was tough, and the sharp fingernails and bruising strength did little to her.</p>
<p>She bit again. Now she bit into bone, and something which <em>oozed</em>. Part of the former [Florist] wanted to scream. But the zombie was danger. To the boy—</p>
<p>She realized he was still there as she knelt on the ground, savaging the dead zombie’s form. The girl turned her head towards him. He was wide-eyed, pale with horror as he stared at her.</p>
<p>For a moment she wanted to say something. But though she opened her mouth, no words came out. And he—he looked into her eyes and saw only a horror. A monster.</p>
<p>“Get—get away!”</p>
<p>The young man she’d saved struck her in the face, in the chest, kicking her backwards. The girl looked at him, the monster salivated. She wanted to eat him.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t. That much she held onto. And now he was pulling out a dagger, holding it in his bleeding hands. Danger.</p>
<p>So she fled. She fled into the street, crying. She could still cry. She ran down an alleyway, and into a small open space. And then she saw it.</p>
<p>The skeleton. He was walking down the street, slashing at the air angrily with a sword. He was all bones—little to eat. She stopped when she saw him, feeling afraid for some reason. His purple eyes found her, and the girl inside the beast shuddered in panic. She turned to run—</p>
<p>But he stabbed her from behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Goblin warriors heard the girl scream. And they saw the skeleton stabbing at her, because they’d been following her for the last block.</p>
<p>It had just been a chance encounter. But as the Goblins had moved silently through the streets, searching for bodies that weren’t completely rotted, they’d come across a fortuitous find. A gang of four men had been pilfering a box with some spices inside. Naturally, the Goblins had fallen on them at once. An arrow to the back, two blades stabbing. Grunter just pushed one of the men’s heads into a wall, killing him.</p>
<p>They didn’t mind killing Humans. It was just that they didn’t do it needlessly. Food was a definite need, though. So the Goblins had been lugging their find back to the small base they’d set up in a ruined building when they’d seen the girl.</p>
<p>She’d stood out. Not because of her ragged clothing, or thin body—all the Humans more or less looked like that in the city. But she was clearly different from the other Humans.</p>
<p>Her face was different. No, not just her face, her very body. It was as if someone had taken a bit of monster, a bit of savage primal humanity and something darker, and put it into her body. And the way she moved! She moved around hunched, or on all fours, more like an animal or stalking thing than a Human.</p>
<p>It had stood out. Badarrow had pointed the girl out and the Goblins had watched her, as a potential threat more than anything else. But then they’d seen the girl find a body in the snow.</p>
<p>It was rotted, a Human’s body, some warrior who’d died in the battle for Esthelm. Even the other Goblins had turned their noses up at it—they preferred fresh dead meat, thank you. But the girl had dug it up—and then begun to eat it!</p>
<p>That had stopped the Redfang warriors in their tracks. For a moment they hadn’t believed what they were seeing. A Human? Eating a dead body?</p>
<p>Well, yes. Humans did that all the time. With animals, of course, as if that made a difference. But this young woman was eating another Human!</p>
<p>That wasn’t shocking to the Goblins, at least in a basic sense. They ate Humans all the time. It was just survival. But as far as they knew, other Humans never ate each other—or even other species, for that matter!</p>
<p>It made her stand out, and because they were curious, the Goblins had followed her a bit longer. They were adept at keeping to shadows, so they’d seen the zombie crawl out of the sewers and the way the girl had stalked it.</p>
<p>Yes, stalked it. They could tell the signs. And then they’d seen her rescue the young Human man, and run from him.</p>
<p>How strange. How curious! And—how disturbing.</p>
<p>Again, not the Human girl, or whatever strange thing she actually was. It was the zombie that made Grunter grunt in alarm and Headscratcher eye the sewers.</p>
<p>The undead. How could the Goblins have forgotten them? If they were rising—</p>
<p>It was bad news. Very bad. The Goblins had no desire to fight off a horde of zombies, much less the stronger undead that would rise with so many bodies around. They were about to retreat and reconsider their hiding spot—they’d need to create traps and barricades if the undead were about—when they heard the girl scream.</p>
<p>That was when they saw the skeleton. It had encountered the girl on the street, a skeleton with a sword. And when she’d turned to flee, the skeleton had stabbed her in the back!</p>
<p>It wasn’t a deep wound, but the Goblins saw the skeleton cutting at the girl’s legs, trying to cripple her. She was trying to flee, and perhaps she would succeed. She was quick—quicker than a normal Human. And her skin was tough enough that the skeleton’s slightly dulled blade couldn’t cut her that deep.</p>
<p>The Goblins watched, sitting in a rooftop that had remained after the fire. The girl slashed at the skeleton with her claws, snarling desperately. Badarrow nudged Rabbiteater and pointed. The Goblins looked and saw she had strangely long fingers and nails that were more like claws on the ends of them. And from the way they cut into the skeleton’s bone, they were clearly sharp as steel!</p>
<p>What<em> was</em> this strange Human? Was she some kind of…of half-breed? There were Goblins who’d been born of Humans of course, so the idea wasn’t new to the Goblins, but this?</p>
<p>The Goblins had never heard of a Human like this. Perhaps it was all some Skill? They knew some Drakes and Gnolls fought with their claws and could get Skills like this. But a Human?</p>
<p>And her jaw! Headscratcher blinked as the monster girl tried to take a bite out of the skeleton. He dodged back, and her gaping mouth caught only air. Even the Goblins thought that looked creepy, the way she could make her jaw open so wide.</p>
<p>The skeleton tried to stab her in the stomach, but the girl smacked his sword away. It was a lucky blow; she clearly hadn’t expected to be able to, but she was strong. Strong, fast, ravenous…</p>
<p><strong>“Ghoul.”</strong></p>
<p>That was what Grunter muttered. The others looked at him, and then nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>She was <em>exactly</em> like a Ghoul, one of the ravenous undead that fought in bursts of frenzied movement. And yet, she was more than a Ghoul. She was still alive, and she had a keen intelligence about her that Ghouls lacked. But for all that—</p>
<p>The skeleton was stronger. Not just stronger—he was fighting smart. When he lost his sword, the skeleton crouched and kicked out. The girl stumbled, and then the undead tackled her, knocking her to the ground. She cried out, trying to throw it off her, but the skeleton was on top of her. He punched her in the face, repeatedly, hammering his fist into her head as she cried out in pain and fear.</p>
<p>He was going to bash her brains out. The Goblins watched, some turning away now the fight was over. They wouldn’t interfere in a fight like this. It wasn’t like the Human boy—here were two killers, killing each other. It was just life.</p>
<p>They turned to go, but a faint sound stopped them. Sitting closest to the scene on his part of the roof, Headscratcher made a quizzical noise. They looked at him, and he scratched his head slowly, before pointing at the skeleton.</p>
<p>Skeleton. Yes, it was a skeleton. The Redfang warriors stared at Headscratcher blankly. Where was he going with this?</p>
<p>Slowly, the finger shifted to the girl.</p>
<p>Girl. Or rather, young woman.</p>
<p>They stared at her. A young Human woman. Something about the way they thought that bugged them.</p>
<p>A young Human woman? An [Innkeeper].</p>
<p>Everyone stared at Headscratcher. No. It couldn’t be it. But he pointed insistently at the skeleton. And the other Goblins stared at it, suddenly connecting the dots.</p>
<p>A skeleton. Hadn’t Garen Redfang mentioned something about a skeleton? Yes, he’d said it was pulling the [Innkeeper] on a sleigh!</p>
<p>It was highly unusual to see a skeleton here, even in this city where the dead were rising. Even if the dead rose—they’d be zombies and ghouls, not skeletons. They hadn’t nearly enough time to rot to that extent. So why was a skeleton <em>here?</em></p>
<p>The Goblins stared at each other. Here was a Human girl. And a skeleton. And Esthelm had been a city full of inns, hadn’t it?</p>
<p>Then again, the skeleton was trying to beat the girl to death. Even as the Goblins watched, the skeleton drew a bloody fist back. He was pounding the girl’s head into the broken ground, drawing blood. She was making a whimpering sound, not even fighting back.</p>
<p>Something stirred in the Goblins’ chests. But they were still reluctant to act. So what if she died? Their job had to been to kill her, after all.</p>
<p>Headscratcher nodded, but then shook his head to this obvious conclusion. He pointed down at the girl and skeleton, raising a thumb.</p>
<p>Skeleton and girl. This might actually be the girl they’d come to kill. But—he shook his head—they wouldn’t kill her because they’d decided. He pointed to the skeleton. He would, though. And that was the problem.</p>
<p>The Goblins stared at Headscratcher, confused. The Goblin tried to explain his line of thought. Garen had ordered them to kill the girl, yes? And if she died, even if the skeleton killed her instead of them, he’d be happy, right?</p>
<p>But they’d decided not to obey Garen! He <em>shouldn’t</em> be obeyed! So—and here Headscratcher’s silent gesturing really got complex—if they were obeying Rags instead of Garen, wouldn’t that mean they would want to protect the [Innkeeper]? At the very least, letting her die was probably as bad as killing her themselves, and if Rags didn’t want that…</p>
<p>The Goblins stared at each other, brains aching with thought. Headscratcher just looked at them, looked at the girl.</p>
<p>They could hear her sobbing. It was a sound that bothered them. They’d heard Humans cry, but this—</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because she ate the dead. Like them. She was doing anything she could to survive. Like them. The skeleton was hitting her, gleefully.</p>
<p>Headscratcher stared at the other reluctant warriors. Then he made a decision. He stood up, unsheathed his sword. He leapt from the rooftop.</p>
<p>After a moment, twelve Goblins followed him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toren saw the first Goblin land on the ground. He stopped punching the strange not-Human he’d found in surprise. The Goblin had a sword in his hand, and he was snarling at Toren.</p>
<p>A Goblin? Had they already begun to attack? Well then, why was Toren wasting time here? He jumped away from the young woman, letting her lie half-dead. He scrambled for his sword, lifting it with a grin.</p>
<p>One Goblin was no threat. He charged at the Goblin and locked blades, forcing the Goblin back a step. But to his surprise, the Goblin threw Toren backwards after a moment of struggle. He was <em>strong!</em> Stronger than a Goblin should be!</p>
<p>That made Toren angry. What was with strong warriors popping up all over the place? A Gold-rank adventurer he could respect, but a <em>Goblin?</em></p>
<p>He was about to hack at the Goblin when another Goblin landed on the ground next to him. A Goblin with a bow. He drew and loosed an arrow at Toren’s skull in an instant. The skeleton dodged reflexively, and the arrow flew past him.</p>
<p>Two Goblins. Okay, they might be a bit stronger than usual, but—</p>
<p>Five more Goblins landed next to them. The flames in Torne’s eyes dimmed as he saw they all wore armor and moved to surround him.</p>
<p>Where were all these Goblins <em>coming</em> from? Struck by a thought, Toren looked up. He saw a huge, fat foot descending towards his face—</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grunter <em>smashed</em> the skeleton into the ground, landing heavily and grunting in his trademark fashion as he did. He kicked the skull several feet away dismissively, and stared at the girl.</p>
<p>She was curled up into a small ball of misery and pain. She was still sobbing, not even realizing she’d been saved. There was only pain and her, waiting for death.</p>
<p>Too familiar. Grunter looked away and grunted. The sound made the girl look up.</p>
<p>She stared at the Goblins and made a choked, screaming sound when she saw them. She tried to get away, but her legs still weren’t working. But the Goblins didn’t attack her. They just stared at her, and then went into a huddle.</p>
<p>For the Redfang warriors, they were suddenly faced with a conundrum after saving the girl and killing the skeleton. Okay, they’d saved her, and if she was the [Innkeeper], they’d probably done a good thing that Rags would approve of, right?</p>
<p>Right. But what did they do next? All eyes turned to Headscratcher. He just scratched his head, unsure.</p>
<p>The Goblins stared at the girl. She was crouched warily on the ground, staring at them with huge eyes. They returned to their huddle.</p>
<p>They could probably just leave her, right? After all, what else could they do? She was safe—they’d done what was probably the right thing. Now it was time to go back and eat.</p>
<p>Undead in the city. Badarrow grunted as he retrieved his missed arrow. The girl stared at him as he passed—he eyed her. The Goblins turned to go. The girl stared at them. Her stare bothered the Goblins more than they could really say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goblins? They’d saved her. Why?</p>
<p>The monster didn’t know. But the Goblins <em>had</em> saved her, and they weren’t going to attack her or—or do worse. She’d been afraid of that for a moment, but the Goblin with the bow had just walked past her without even looking right at her.</p>
<p>Now they seemed to be leaving. The Goblins slowly walked away.</p>
<p>Leaving her behind. Even Goblins didn’t want to associate with a monster.</p>
<p>Hot wetness blinded the horror for a second. She could still taste the rotting flesh in her mouth, still see the horror in the young man’s eyes. She was a monster. No—worse than that.</p>
<p>She looked at the backs of the retreating Goblin warriors. Goblins. They were monsters, too. They’d saved her. Because she was a monster like them?</p>
<p>The Goblins had destroyed Esthelm. They were horrible, pillaging, raping creatures who killed any Human they came across. They were true monsters.</p>
<p>But so was she.</p>
<p>And she was alone. And if they killed her—</p>
<p>Slowly, the girl got up. Her face burned and she had trouble breathing from where the skeleton had tried to crush her windpipe. She stared at the backs of monsters, short, green creatures that walked like men.</p>
<p>Monsters.</p>
<p>She followed them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Toren reassembled this time he was ready to kill everything in the world. He got up and then ran around, hitting everything in sight.</p>
<p>Goblins! He’d been defeated by—by <em>Goblins! </em>And it hadn’t even been like last time! Last time he’d been outnumbered but this time—</p>
<p>One had landed on him! The indignity of it made Toren so angry he felt like he could have exploded. He was filled with all-consuming rage.</p>
<p>And fear. A bit of fear was in Toren as well. For the first time, he sensed danger.</p>
<p>Not because of the Goblins. Damn the Goblins! He could kill them if he had time to plan things out, he was sure. But Toren felt the mana in his body running dangerously low.</p>
<p>Erin supplied him with energy, of course. He knew that. Normally it was enough for everything he did, even though she wasn’t exactly a font of magic. But after so many repeated deaths and reassemblies, he realized he was on the verge of running out.</p>
<p>If he was scattered one more time, if his pieces were separated—Toren feared the animation spell that gave him life might end for good. He couldn’t let that happen.</p>
<p>He couldn’t…<em>die.</em></p>
<p>No problem, then! Toren would just find somewhere to wait while he regained a bit more mana. An hour would be enough. All he had to do was get his sword and…and…</p>
<p>Toren looked for his sword. He’d dropped over there? Over here? He paused, and then did a slow circle.</p>
<p>No. It couldn’t be. It was impossible!</p>
<p>He’d lost his sword! Toren searched for it frantically in the snow, trying not to believe it was true. But it was.</p>
<p>His sword was gone.</p>
<p>Had one of the Goblins taken it? Or the monster-girl?</p>
<p>Maybe. All Toren knew was that he was suddenly defenseless. Of course, he could fight with his hands and feet, but that wasn’t the same as having a weapon. His Skills were designed for a weapon—without one, Toren did feel vulnerable.</p>
<p>And he couldn’t die.</p>
<p>The skeleton felt a chill in his bones. He stared around the open area, suddenly realizing how vulnerable he was. If one of the Goblins came back, or even the girl-thing—</p>
<p>He couldn’t risk it. The skeleton hesitated, then swiftly ran down an alley.</p>
<p>He had to find shelter. A hiding spot. Could he squeeze himself into a small space? What about a weapon? Could he take one from a Human? But what if they got lucky and killed him?</p>
<p>Toren had never been so afraid. He ran, pausing at every shadow, trying to find somewhere totally secluded. He spotted an opening in the ground—a dark entrance and dove towards it.</p>
<p>The sewers! Toren immediately recognized the foul, dark tunnels and relaxed. No one would come down here! Not even Goblins liked this much filth. He could rest here, wait a while. And then—</p>
<p>The skeleton had let his guard down too early. As he walked further into the sewers, his foot caught on a floating body. It moved, and then jerked to life.</p>
<p>A corpse, dead, eyes glowing with yellow light, sprang up. Toren jerked back, and then realized one of the dead had risen. Oh. Was that all? It had surprised him, but it was just a zombie. Toren backed away in case the undead started flailing about—</p>
<p>The dead body sprang at Toren, making a gurgling <em>snarling</em> sound. Toren jerked in shock, and the corpse bore him into the slime of the sewers.</p>
<p>Not a zombie! A <em>Ghoul!</em> More bodies were rising around Toren, actual zombies this time. But the ghoul had focused on Toren and identified him as a threat. It tore at the skeleton, trying to rip his bones away—</p>
<p><em>Trying to kill him.</em></p>
<p>Fear suddenly gripped Toren. He clenched his bony fists and began hammering at the Ghoul, trying to knock it off him, break its skull. But it was freshly dead and still relatively intact. And it had him on the ground! It was tearing away Toren’s ribs, one at a time!</p>
<p>So strong! It—Toren was going to die! It was stronger than Toren, and tougher too in this moment. He felt so weak.</p>
<p>He was going to die.</p>
<p>No! Toren plunged a finger into the Ghoul’s eye socket, piercing the rotted eyeball. But the Ghoul felt no pain and didn’t need eyes to see. Toren punched the corpse repeatedly, but nothing was working.</p>
<p>He was going to die! The Ghoul was going to kill him! It was impossible! Unacceptable! He couldn’t die like this!</p>
<p><em>Not like this!</em> Toren raged silently as he tried to force the Ghoul off of him. Not like this! Not to a Ghoul! If he had time—a bit more time to regain mana!</p>
<p>Someone, anyone! Toren cried out. He needed help! He needed assistance! Anyone, the adventurer, the Humans with clubs, the monster girl, the Goblins—</p>
<p>The ghoul was reaching for his head, twisting it. It would all be over. Toren fought it, trying to hold the arms back. So weak. Someone. Please help.</p>
<p><em>Erin—</em></p>
<p>A hand dragged the Ghoul off of Toren. The skeleton saw the Ghoul jerk, turn—another hand smashed into the back of its head.</p>
<p>Erin?</p>
<p>For a second the skeleton thought—but when he stood up, he saw only zombies.</p>
<p>Zombies?</p>
<p>Yes, the undead corpses were surrounding the Ghoul! In disbelief, Toren saw the Ghoul fighting them, tearing at their faces, trying to bear them to the ground—but six zombies were all striking it, tearing it apart, eating its flesh—</p>
<p>The zombies had helped Toren. That was what the skeleton realized after the shock had worn off. He sat in the filth of the sewer as the zombies finished destroying the Ghoul, leaving the chewed limbs floating in the water.</p>
<p>How? And why? All Toren knew was that he’d cried out for help. He’d reached out—</p>
<p>And the zombies had answered. These, the lowliest of the undead had come to his aid. Why? Because he was a skeleton and they were like him? Because they hated ghouls?</p>
<p>No, that was silly. It was because—</p>
<p>Toren touched the flames in his skull. His eyes? Skinner had commanded the dead. Was it that? Something else? Some secret to his creation?</p>
<p>The skeleton didn’t know. But the zombies stopped, swaying in front of him. They were waiting for his command.</p>
<p>The skeleton stared at them in shock. And then he heard the voice, echoing in his head. He hadn’t heard it for a while, but now it came into his mind, sharp and clear, and oh so welcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Leader Class Obtained!]</p>
<p>[Leader Level 1!]</p>
<p>[Skill – Command Lesser Undead obtained!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a few moment, Toren’s head was filled with clouds. He stood in the sewer, poleaxed by the revelation. But when he came back to himself, he just stared at the zombies.</p>
<p>Six zombies. Waiting for his command. And now Toren felt certain he <em>could </em>command them. In fact, if he wanted to…</p>
<p>Well now. Wasn’t <em>this </em>interesting?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the story of a skeleton. He stood in the dark sewers of a city full of death, where a Human with silver armor tried to save the living and a monster followed a band of Goblin warriors. The skeleton had travelled far, had thrown off his shackles and come here.</p>
<p>He had been humbled. He had nearly died. But he had survived. He had survived and he would still survive, growing stronger. That was what he pledged to himself. He would survive.</p>
<p>And he was no longer alone.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Esthelm. City of the damned and dead. That was how it felt sometimes. Of course, there were thousands of people still living inside of it, but for many, their miserable, desperate existence was just a prelude to death and worse. Their home was in ruins, and their city was slowly filling with the undead. It was undeniable, now.</p>
<p>They came out of the sewers. They sat up in the cold snow. They dug themselves out of the frozen ground and from beneath the rubble.</p>
<p>They rose.</p>
<p>Not just one, not just two—hundreds. Hundreds. Zombies, yes, but ghouls as well. They came for the living, and without trained warriors, the refugees of Esthelm could not hope to defend themselves from such a horde.</p>
<p>If they could, they would have fled. Even the cold, merciless winter night was better than death and undeath. But they could not.</p>
<p>An army of Goblins camped outside the city. Already, a score of people had died as they’d tried to leave the city and been set on. The Goblins maintained a perimeter, laughing, shooting arrows at any Human they saw. And more were coming. Already the people could see Goblin warriors wearing black armor gathering into teams, preparing to sweep into the city.</p>
<p>Goblins outside, undead within. And disunity and chaos among them. The Humans despaired and some simply waited for death while others took what small satisfaction they could, giving into cruelty and lust before the end. After all, who would save them?</p>
<p>The answer came during the darkest hours of the night, when some huddled behind the flimsy walls they’d built and others went searching for victims. They heard a voice, and saw silver.</p>
<p>A man in plate armor. An adventurer with a sword and shield. No, no ordinary adventurer—a Gold-rank one! A [Knight].</p>
<p>He strode into one camp and raised his voice.</p>
<p>“Citizens of Esthelm! Hear my words!”</p>
<p>No one had called them that, or thought of them like that since the city had fallen. People, disbelieving, crept out to watch him and saw the men at his back. Men and women. And children. Hundreds, already close to a thousand.</p>
<p>“Esthelm has fallen. But you still remain! The undead rise and must be stopped. A Goblin army has come to kill whomever remains in this city. If you keep fighting among yourselves, you will die! But together we may yet live.”</p>
<p>That was all he said. But the people saw him bring his hundreds into the camp, and begin building. He had more rubble removed, had people with Skills—people who’d almost forgotten their Classes—begin to build.</p>
<p>He had them build a wall. Not around a small plot of land to hide in, as the others had done, but massive barricades, linking half-fallen buildings and sealing off entire streets. He was building fortifications, sealing off nearly a quarter of the city and setting guards, men and women with weapons and hope in their eyes to fend off the undead.</p>
<p>He was retaking their home. And so people came forward, at first the desperate, but then everyone, abandoning the places they’d carved out, coming, some fearful, others ashamed, but coming nevertheless.</p>
<p>Coming home. And so the Humans built desperately, and gathered arms, and the Gold-rank adventurer walked among them, tirelessly coordinating them, giving them courage.</p>
<p>Ylawes Byres. He stared towards the edge of the city, where the Goblins were waiting. He’d chosen a spot as far away from them as possible. It would be war soon, he knew. A last war, a final war for this city. Whether it would mean death and ruin for a place already rotten and torn apart or a new spark of life for this place he did not know. He only knew he would make the Goblins pay in blood for every step they took.</p>
<p>However, this was not his story. Instead, the city’s fate belonged in no small part to another being. A skeleton, a creature of death, common and worthless among the endless undead. Yet this one was unlike any other skeleton in the world. He danced in the dying city, as the snow began to fall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A shadow shivered and twisted amidst the center of the city. A shadow with eyes that burned purple and bright even in the darkest night. Shapes moved and walked among the empty buildings, crawling, creeping, seeking out the light to snuff it out.</p>
<p>But the shadow danced on. Death and corruptions swirled through the streets, standing up, taking awful forms and biting, chewing. But the shadow danced, and it had a name.</p>
<p>Toren.</p>
<p>He whirled about in the street, arms spread wide. His was not some demonic summoning, nor the wild and sinister movements of ritual and sin. Instead, the skeleton ran about, twirling and doing handstands and waving his arms about, full of innocent mirth. He danced like a child, delighted, simple. He had a new toy! Not just one in fact. He had a world full of them!</p>
<p>He could control the undead! How wonderful was that?</p>
<p>Toren stopped whirling about and turned to look at some of the shadows around him. Six swaying corpses stared at him, barely noticeable as they stood in the shadows. They had been men and women, but now rot and decay had turned them into something else.</p>
<p>Zombies. Pathetic fodder any warrior could kill individually, only fearsome in vast numbers, and even then, only to the unprepared. But they were <em>his</em>. His.</p>
<p>He could control them. Toren knew it. He felt the certainty in his mind and saw it when he ordered the zombies to follow him. He walked down the street as they followed in his wake.</p>
<p>This changed everything. Toren had been about to die, and they had saved him. And now—</p>
<p>What should he do now? Toren glanced at one of the zombies and it stopped. He slowly made it walk in front of him, and inspected the zombie carefully.</p>
<p>Yup. Dead. And a worm was crawling around in its exposed brain. Toren pulled it out and patted the zombie on its squishy head. His zombie.</p>
<p>Of course, he could always get a new one. But for now, Toren was curious. What could it do? He made the zombie walk back and forth in front of him, hit the zombie standing next to it, lie down…</p>
<p>Interesting. He <em>couldn’t</em> tell the zombie to do very specific things. For instance, Toren had tried to get the zombie to hop on one leg and it hadn’t moved. Because he was too low level? All he could get it to do was move and attack what he wanted.</p>
<p>That was too bad. But then again, it was still an excellent start. Toren rubbed his hands together, grinning.</p>
<p>Zombies. Just imagine what he could do with them! He’d no longer be alone in a fight—he wouldn’t even have to fight if he didn’t want to.</p>
<p>True, this didn’t mean he could suddenly challenge Griffon Hunt or even the Gold-rank adventurer who’d beaten him once. Toren knew that. Right now he could control six undead. And only zombies to boot. But if he leveled? What then?</p>
<p>The possibilities sent shivers down the skeleton’s spine. Where could he begin? How would he level up?</p>
<p>By leading his minions, obviously. Toren cast around, and then had another idea. He was still a bit low on mana. He could probably pull himself back together once if he was broken, but he didn’t want to risk anything.</p>
<p>So why not stop fighting himself and instead have some fun? His zombies might be mindless, but they could certainly help out Toren in their limited way. To start with for example…</p>
<p>A sword. Toren wanted one. His zombies lurched towards a camp of Humans he’d seen earlier that day. They were a group of men who’d hunkered down in an alleyway, putting up flimsy barricades and trash barriers to keep other people away.</p>
<p>The zombies came to the alleyway and paused. They turned into it, walking, stumbling forwards. Perched on a crumbling rooftop, Toren watched as one of the men on guard duty shouted out in alarm as he saw the zombies.</p>
<p>Within moments, the other men—who’d been sleeping in clumsy sleeping bags made of whatever fabric they could get their hands on around the smoldering fire—were on their feet. They grasped weapons in their hands, clubs, slings, and, Toren was pleased to note, an iron short sword held by a big man that looked like their leader.</p>
<p>The gang of men was clearly arguing as the zombies slowly broke down the wooden planks that had been nailed together to form an obstacle and then slowly came down the alley towards them. Half of them wanted to leave, but their leader pointed out the obvious. There were six zombies, and they were eight strong! Plus, the zombies were slow, clumsy—their slinger whirled a stone that took the eye out of one. The other men began throwing things, and the zombies stumbled and one fell, struggling to get up.</p>
<p>Stupid, foolish undead. They’d never get close enough at their meandering pace. The men laughed and shouted triumphantly as they began to batter the zombies with missiles. From his seat above, Toren laughed and gave his zombies one order.</p>
<p>The foremost zombie had been stumbling backwards, flesh torn and bones fractured from the stones that kept smashing into his skull. Bits of brain were already leaking from his open skull. The man throwing stones stood confidently ahead of the others, picking up rocks from a pile at his feet as he confidently loosed stones at the zombies. He was close to them, but so what? It wasn’t as if they could move—</p>
<p>The zombie took a step, and then <em>charged</em> down the alleyway. The man with the sling screamed in horror and turned to run. But too late—the zombie tackled him, and then he was tearing at the man as he tried to fight the creature off with his hands, biting at his throat—ripping away red flesh—</p>
<p>The gang of men had frozen in horror. Half of them ran forwards to help their friend, but then they decided he was dead and tried to run. Again, too late.</p>
<p>The other zombies ran at them, not sluggishly lurching as they’d done before, but <em>sprinting</em>, moving with inhuman speed that cared nothing for torn muscle or the broken ground. The men raised their weapons, but found they were of little use. Clubs that could break bones and spiked bats that could tear flesh did not scare those already dead.</p>
<p>The leader of the gang backed up. His sword at least could chop, but he was no [Swordsman], or even a [Warrior]. He hacked at the zombies killing the screaming men in his gang, hitting his comrades as often as the zombies. And when the zombies dropped the dead men to the ground, the man with the short sword found himself alone.</p>
<p>He turned to run. But the zombies were quick.</p>
<p>Sitting on the rooftop, Toren grinned as the zombies finished killing the leader. Only three were left; the man with the sword had gotten one, and two more had been killed in the fight. But so what? He knew there were countless zombies in the city.</p>
<p>And he’d come up with another excellent discovery for his trouble. The zombies had taken out the men so easily, and with just one order from him. A simple one, really. He didn’t know why he hadn’t thought of it instantly.</p>
<p>Run. That was all he’d told them to do. Just…run. And so they’d ran.</p>
<p>Why didn’t zombies do it all the time? Toren realized that maybe some did—he hadn’t exactly even seen that many zombies before today. Just when Skinner had attacked Erin’s inn, really. And in the crypt.</p>
<p>Zombies were weak. True. They were slow and they rotted easily and they had no concept of dodging, blocking, or even retreating. But what if you could make them run? Then you had an entirely different kind of monster on your hands. Because yes, zombies were simple fighters, but they were still <em>strong.</em> And they didn’t fear injury.</p>
<p>Toren clattered his jaw excitedly. He could already sense that this little skirmish had helped him get closer to a level up. In a moment he’d go down and get his new sword. And then—</p>
<p>Well, he had zombies, didn’t he? And there were many more groups of thugs, just waiting for the day so they could begin marauding again. Perfect prey, in short. Could Toren wipe out an even bigger gang with six zombies? Could he do it without losing even one?</p>
<p>This was a challenge. A <em>fun</em> challenge. Toren leapt from his rooftop and landed in the snow, where his undead servants were waiting for him. He looked into their lifeless eyes, their empty sockets, and grinned. He smiled, and in his eyes, Esthelm burned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the story of a monster. This is the story of a girl. At least, she’d been a girl, a Human once.</p>
<p>Now she didn’t know what she was.</p>
<p>She had no name. Or rather, she’d forgotten it. It, like all her words, was gone. Only hunger remained. Hunger, and despair.</p>
<p>And fear. That was the real irony of it all, wasn’t it? That even now, even when she’d lost everything, her family, home, levels—even humanity—even now, she was afraid of dying.</p>
<p>She’d nearly died. The skeleton she’d encountered had tried to kill her. He’d pounded at her, trying to kill her. And she’d wept, because she would finally die and be free of the nightmare.</p>
<p>But she hadn’t <em>wanted </em>to die. She’d still wanted to live, even then. She’d nearly given up hope, though, resigned herself to death.</p>
<p>That’s when they’d saved her. The Goblins. They’d come and killed the skeleton. She’d thought they just wanted to kill and eat her themselves, or do worse, but they hadn’t. They’d looked at her and left.</p>
<p>So why had she followed them? The monster paused as she loped on all fours after them. The snow and stone were cold on her skin, but her new body could withstand far more than her old one. Even now, the beating the skeleton had given her was healing.</p>
<p>But the Goblins? Why pursue them? She didn’t know. But they were monsters. So maybe she deserved their company. And she had nothing else, so why not? Death would be a welcome thing if it came to that.</p>
<p>At any rate, the Goblins weren’t chasing her off. The girl in the monster saw the warriors glancing back at her as they marched through the empty streets now and then, but none of them tried to chase her off. Rather, it looked like they were chattering amongst themselves as they looked at her.</p>
<p>Could Goblins talk? Maybe in their own language. The monster didn’t know. But she was surprised by the idea. And when she saw the place the Goblins had chosen to camp for the night—</p>
<p>Her jaw dropped in surprise. The Goblins had set up in the center of a building that had been hollowed out by fire. But instead of squatting in the ashes and ruins like beasts, they’d cleared away the soot and snow, revealing bare stone. They’d taken bits of wood and covered the windows and doors, and even built a fire pit in the center of the building!</p>
<p>Now two of the Goblins sat around the fire pit, one piling kindling together and shaving bits of wood as the other struck sparks. A small fragment of wood caught, and the Goblins put their hands around the small flame, shielding it as it ate the kindling and grew.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes they had a fire. The monster sat on her haunches on the edge of the building, afraid to go in. But the warriors took no notice of her, and so she dared enter the camp. She stared around with wide eyes, drinking in…</p>
<p>Civilization. It was such an odd word, but that was what she saw. The warriors were making a fire. And what were they doing now? The Goblins were…putting their beds together! They had beds?</p>
<p>Yes, some of the Goblins had blankets in their possessions. Others had only the clothing they wore—one had a small stuffed pillow of all things, just large enough to cushion his head! They spread out their gear—weapons, bows and arrows—around them, forming small nests close to but not too near the fire. Places to sleep, places of their own.</p>
<p>They were so <em>normal</em>. The monster couldn’t believe her eyes. Were these really Goblins, the raiding, murderous monsters that adventurers hunted for bronze coins? Then she heard a voice grunting by her ear.</p>
<p>“Ur.”</p>
<p>The girl turned in fright. A Goblin was glaring at her. She turned to run, but he wasn’t raising his sword to attack. Instead, he was pointing.</p>
<p>What? The monster girl looked around wildly, and then realized.</p>
<p>She was in the way! She was blocking the doorway! The Goblin edged by her as she scrambled aside. She looked fearfully at him, but he just snorted at her and marched out the doorway. He came back in a few moments later with a pot he’d filled with fresh snow. He glanced at her as he walked back towards the fire, but did nothing else.</p>
<p>They didn’t care about her. They didn’t fear her or—or her face. The idea struck the creature dumb with shock. She watched, awed and amazed as the Goblin with the pot hung it over the fire. The snow began to melt in the pot, and she realized they were going to make dinner.</p>
<p>From what? The thing looked, and saw something lying in a corner of the room. Were those rags?</p>
<p>No. Bodies.</p>
<p>Suddenly, her heart froze in her chest. The monster stared as one of the Goblins approached the corpses of Humans and one Goblin, knife in hand. That was right. Goblins ate the dead, even their own.</p>
<p>They were monsters just like her.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the horror felt a pang in her stomach, and realized she was starving. Even if she forgot for a moment, she was always consumed by it. The unrelenting, unending <em>emptiness</em> in her stomach.</p>
<p>She stared at the corpses, salivating quietly. She longed to eat the frozen bodies—even if they were rotten and foul. She would eat her own kind, even though her soul revolted. She would eat the Goblins too, and her own flesh it if meant filling the hole inside of her.</p>
<p>The monster edged towards the pile of bodies. Food. The Goblins were looking at her now and then, but they wouldn’t stop her, would they? It was food. If they stopped her, she would bite them, tear at them. She had to eat. She was so <em>hungry—</em></p>
<p>Her jaw opened. The thing reached for a body, and then saw something move towards her. Something big.</p>
<p>She turned, and saw the Hobgoblin stand up. He’d been sitting quietly amidst his fellows while they worked, helping to chop wood into smaller bits to feed the fire, but now he stood. He was clearly the leader of the group—even the former young woman knew that. She’d heard tales of Hobgoblins, feared even by Silver-rank adventurers for their strength and cunning in battle.</p>
<p>And now he was looking. At. Her.</p>
<p>The Hobgoblin grunted as he slowly walked over to the monster. She stared up at him, awed by his sheer size. He was <em>massive</em>, tall as a tall Human man, and far wider. But all that flesh wasn’t fat—it was muscle, rippling, tough, <em>raw</em>—</p>
<p>She tore her eyes away from his body. Fearfully, the monster girl retreated a bit. What was he going to do? Was he going to—</p>
<p>The Hobgoblin pointed at the thing and it—she—froze, about to dart away, back into the darkness of the city. But he didn’t grab for her. Rather he opened his mouth and spoke.</p>
<p>“In.”</p>
<p>It was a word! An actual word! The young woman froze, eyes wide. Goblins could <em>speak?</em> He could—speak?</p>
<p>Yes, he could. The Hobgoblin concentrated, frowning mightily. He forced out more syllables, his voice thick with concentration.</p>
<p>“Inkreepr. You. You innkreeper?”</p>
<p>Innkeeper? The girl had no idea what he meant. He pointed at her and repeated the word.</p>
<p>“Innkeeper. You? Clss.”</p>
<p>Her class? He was asking…?</p>
<p>Slowly, wide-eyed, the horror shook her head. She’d never been an [Innkeeper], never even considered it. She had been—she’d used to raise flowers. Even the thought made her heart ache. Flowers? Who needed flowers in this broken place?</p>
<p>The Hobgoblin stared down at her, looking surprised and even a bit irritated. He moved—she flinched again, but he just turned and growled something at another Goblin warrior sitting by the now merry fire. The Goblin stared at the girl. He was a normal-sized Goblin warrior, much like the others. He scratched his head, and muttered a word in another language.</p>
<p>The other Goblins stared at him, the head scratcher. One reached out and punched him on the shoulder. He grunted, but didn’t punch back. Then they all just turned and stared at the monster-girl.</p>
<p>For a minute they stared, and then one of them shrugged. He pointed towards the fire and beckoned towards her.</p>
<p>“Urg?”</p>
<p>Almost disbelieving, she crept forwards. She expected them to grab her at any second, to tear her clothes off and—no, even they wouldn’t sink that low, would they? But she expected them to stab at her, or to chase her away?</p>
<p>But nothing happened. The Goblins just stared at her, and let her inch closer to the fire. One of them sniffed at her—the other one poked a finger into his ear and wiggled it about. Then they went about their business.</p>
<p>They didn’t fear her, and clearly they had no idea what to make of her. The girl stared at them, and then saw three Goblins go over to the corpses.</p>
<p><em>Flesh.</em></p>
<p>She was there in an instant. She wanted to bite, to tear at the frozen bodies, but the Goblins had other ideas. When she grabbed a leg one of them grabbed her. She froze in fright, but the Goblin just pulled her away, grunting disapprovingly.</p>
<p>He had a knife in his hand. He used it to cut at the body, removing flesh swiftly, cutting away the most palatable parts. The thing salivated. It reached for the food, wanting to eat it there and then—</p>
<p>But the Goblins stopped her. They shook their heads at her and pulled her back. Not understanding, confused, the young woman stopped. She watched as the Goblins took the meat they’d cut and brought it over to the pot.</p>
<p>It was a big pot. The Hob had carried it no doubt, and it was boiling with water. Even as the monster watched, the Goblins added meat to the pot. And then…they began to cook with it.</p>
<p>She couldn’t believe her eyes. What were they doing? Cooking meat? But it was—it had been part of Humans and even other Goblins. It was still flesh. It was still—but it was different. The Goblins cooked the meat like…well, meat. They seasoned it with ground up spices and even added some flour to the soup they were making. And a carrot? Yes, one of the Goblins pulled out a wizened carrot from his belt. Another had a handful of pepper. And then they turned the horrible, terrible thing they’d taken from corpses into something else. Something almost wonderful.</p>
<p>Soup. The smell made the girl’s mouth water. The memory made her eyes water. It was soup. She hadn’t eaten soup since…</p>
<p>One of the Goblins, the one who seemed to be in charge of stirring and sampling the concoction, decided the food was done. He grabbed a wooden bowl and began ladling the steaming soup into bowls, passing them to the other Goblins. The girl watched, remembering and drooling, until one of the Goblins passed a bowl to <em>her.</em></p>
<p>At first, she recoiled from the heat and the sudden nearness of the Goblin. She stared into crimson eyes, looked at the clawed hand holding the bowl. What? He was giving it to her?</p>
<p>To her? But she hadn’t helped. And yet, the Goblin was offering it to her. The creature struggled with the act of kindness, but the starving thing in her greedily took the bowl. She wanted to say…to thank the Goblin, but she had no words.</p>
<p>And the Goblin had already taken his own bowl. Grinning with delight he set near the fire, making some remark to the other Goblins. So the monster stared at the bowl in her hands, warming her cold body.</p>
<p>Generosity from a Goblin. The bowl was warm and let off steam that dissipated in the cold air around her. The monster stared. Then she ate.</p>
<p>Slowly, clumsily, she lifted the bowl. Her hands felt unused to the motion, as if they’d forgotten how. But some things didn’t fade. Slowly, the young woman blew at the soup, licking at it tentatively until it was cool. Then she tilted the bowl up and tried to eat it as fast as she could, to satiate the thing in her stomach. She slurped the broth greedily, gulping down the chunks of meat and grinding the rest between her sharp teeth. Only when the girl had half-finished her bowl did she realize she was the only one eating this way.</p>
<p>The Goblin warriors were eating, yes, but they were eating…<em>civilly.</em> They didn’t immediately gulp down the soup like she did. They put it into bowls and ate efficiently, some even using knives to fish the meat out and pop it into their mouths. The monster stared at them, soup dripping down her dirty chest.</p>
<p>They ate like people. And she—</p>
<p>She was ashamed. But she was also <em>hungry</em>, so she finished the first bowl they gave her, then the second, the third.</p>
<p>After that, the beast in her had had enough. Which was good, because she’d eaten more than the Goblins had expected. They brewed a second batch of soup, eying her oddly but saying nothing.</p>
<p>They didn’t say much. Rather, each Goblin seemed to know what the others were thinking. That was how the monster-girl found herself sitting at the fire as the others sat around her. They didn’t say much, but that was because they were busy.</p>
<p>They were staring at her. Now that they’d eaten and taken care of the essentials, the Goblins studied the strange Human, the monster that had followed them to their camp. They eyed her from head to toe, unabashedly scrutinizing every part of her.</p>
<p>They didn’t seem to know what to make of her. She didn’t know what she was either, so she just stared back, part of her still afraid. The other part…</p>
<p>Curious.</p>
<p>What would they do? They hadn’t hurt her so far. Instead they’d been—she hadn’t seen other people—other Humans of her kind, that was, making soup in the city. But these Goblins had made fire, cleaned up the building, even offered food to a stranger.</p>
<p>They could speak! They had words! And she did not.</p>
<p>What were they? What was she? The monster felt anguish in her heart—</p>
<p>And then a stone fell into her lap.</p>
<p>She nearly shrieked in surprise, but it was just a pebble. One of the Goblins had thrown it. He immediately received a kick from the others, but now they were all staring at the monster, waiting to see what she would do.</p>
<p>The creature stared at the stone in her lap and picked it up awkwardly. She held it in her hands and stared at the Goblin who’d thrown it. He looked vaguely ashamed. What did he want from her? She didn’t know.</p>
<p>Slowly, hesitantly, she threw the stone back. And missed.</p>
<p>Her aim was terrible. Rather than hit the Goblin who’d thrown it, the pebble flew up and to the left. It struck the Hob sitting behind the Goblin, who’d been eating another bowl of soup.</p>
<p>The pebble bounced right off of the Hobgoblin’s head. He blinked as it splashed in his bowl of soup, and slowly looked down. His chest had been splattered by the hot liquid.</p>
<p>The monster immediately wanted to run and hide, but she was paralyzed by shock. She stared fearfully at the Hobgoblin. So did the other Goblin warriors. They stared, and then one of them made a sound.</p>
<p>He hooted, and pointed at the Hobgoblin. He slapped the ground, and <em>laughed! </em>So did the other Goblins.</p>
<p>They laughed! In an instant, all of them were roaring with uncontrolled laughter, all, except for the Hob who was still processing his reduced bowl of soup. But the other Goblins were filled with mirth. They laughed like people, slapping their sides with mirth, hooting and pointing fingers at the Hobgoblin who picked the stone out with two fat fingers and hurled it over his shoulder.</p>
<p>He glared at the monster, who cringed, but with no real anger in him. Instead, the Hob reached out and flicked the head of the Goblin who’d thrown the stone at her, and then downed the remaining soup in his bowl in a single go. He sighed, chuckled ruefully, and then he laughed too.</p>
<p>Laughter. It was something that was Human or rather—reminded the young woman of Humans. But the Goblins and Humans laughed so much alike, even if the Goblin’s voices were higher and they had an odd cadence to their tones. But they still laughed, needing no words to tell her what they meant.</p>
<p>They laughed, at such a small accident with all the good cheer the young woman had ever seen. And—the girl thought—almost as if they were just relieved to have an excuse to laugh.</p>
<p>At last, the Goblins stopped laughing, but the mood remained. They sat around the fire, exchanging short, sometimes monosyllabic bursts of chatter, but clearly speaking to each other. The thing couldn’t understand, but it lay by the fire, somehow contented just to be.</p>
<p>It was so strange. She’d never felt this way. Not for…over a week. And few times in her previous life, to be honest. But here, among the Goblins she needed to do nothing. She just existed, and that was enough.</p>
<p>Goblins. The crimson eyes of the warriors sitting around her flashed in the darkness. But they weren’t heartless eyes. And their faces, however different they were from Human faces, were still capable of expressing emotion.</p>
<p>Soon, they began to go to sleep. They rolled into their blankets or just sat with a back against the wall and closed their eyes. Then the monster stirred.</p>
<p>She shouldn’t be here. That was what she felt. They were sleeping, but she—</p>
<p>She wasn’t safe here, was she? They’d given her food, but somehow, she still felt like an invader, or a monster living amongst people.</p>
<p>She should go. This had been—enough. This moment.</p>
<p>The monster crept away from the fire, heart aching. But she couldn’t stay. The fire was dying down and with it, the fear was coming back. The terror.</p>
<p>The city was full of darkness. Darkness and death. The dead were coming back. There was violence in the streets. Other people—</p>
<p>She had to hide. Find a tiny crevice to hide in while she slept.</p>
<p>That was what she thought. But the young woman paused as she crept towards the door and saw the Goblin standing watch.</p>
<p>He was sitting, actually. But he was sitting high up, on a broken ledge that allowed him to look out at the streets surrounding the building they’d barricaded themselves in. The Goblin had a bow in his hands and he narrowed his eyes at the monster-girl as she scrambled up to stare at him.</p>
<p>He didn’t smile at her, but neither did he kick her off and down onto the street. The thing looked at him, fearfully, but after a moment he just went back to studying the darkness. She looked as well and her eyes—able to see in the night like day—spotted shapes, moving in the distance.</p>
<p>Zombies.</p>
<p>She shuddered, and the Goblin on watch looked at her, almost amused. He nodded, and tapped the bow at his side. Then he pointed. The young woman turned, and saw a shape lurching down the snowy street towards them. Her heart twisted in her chest as she saw a zombie coming straight at them.</p>
<p>But the Goblin wasn’t afraid. He raised the bow at his side and grinned at her. He pointed, tapping his chest, and then put an arrow to the string with one swift movement. He drew the arrow to his chest, and sighted down the shaft.</p>
<p><em>Fft.</em> The arrow streaked across the void, and <em>thunked</em> into the zombie’s forehead. The young woman stared, and the Goblin grinned. He pointed again. She looked, and saw another zombie, far off, not coming this way.</p>
<p>But it had been marked, and so the Goblin archer drew another arrow. He nocked, aimed, loosed in a single motion. The zombie staggered and fell.</p>
<p>Twice more the Goblin did this, pointing out targets to the monster girl and downing them. Each time he grinned at her, and tapped his own chest. His self-satisfaction was obvious, and he was unashamed of it. He was a master at his craft, an expert showing his skills off to her, like the [Hunters] or [Marksmen] who’d do the same with targets at fairs.</p>
<p>After the fourth zombie had fallen, the Goblin seemed done. He went back to studying the landscape. He looked at the monster, and nodded to the dim embers of the fire inquiringly. She hesitated, and then nodded back, awkwardly.</p>
<p>It was warm near the embers, so the creature crept closer. She lay down there—so close she could smell the smoke and feel the heat on her skin. The dim glow burned in her vision, and she closed her eyes, feeling sleep crawl over her slowly.</p>
<p>Could she stay here? Was this alright? She didn’t know. All the girl who’d become a monster knew was that she didn’t feel the need to hide anymore. Not here.</p>
<p>She slept, feeling safe for the first time in a long while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Badarrow saw the Human girl go to sleep at last by the fire. He saw her chest rise and fall rhythmically, and knew that now would be the time to shoot her, if any. He had an arrow in his hands, and he could put one through the back of her skull in a second if he wanted.</p>
<p>But—no. It would be a waste of an arrow. That was how Badarrow felt.</p>
<p>He didn’t waste arrows. Ever. When Badarrow shot at the enemy, whether it was zombies, Humans, Drakes, Gnolls, or even other Goblins he never wasted an arrow. Even if he missed. Because that arrow was there to hurt the people who were trying to hurt them, and it would do just that, or at least make them cover their heads.</p>
<p>But killing the Human girl? No. She wasn’t an enemy, and she wasn’t a nuisance either. She was something else. But what?</p>
<p>Not a victim. Not something to attack. Garen Redfang was very clear on that one point. He had walked among Humans, and adopted some of their customs. In this at least, he was firm. No Goblin warrior of his would ever assault a female, or male for that matter. They had their own kind for such things, and it was only the worst of tribes that tolerated such actions among their own people. So why degrade themselves for other species?</p>
<p>It was a mark of pride among the Redfang Goblins that they were like their leader. Humans were for killing or ignoring. That was it. Nothing else.</p>
<p>So. No sex. No killing. Just a Human who ate their food and slept next to them as if they were Humans like her. Badarrow couldn’t understand it. But she was clearly more monster than Human, so maybe that was why.</p>
<p>The Goblin [Archer] yawned irritably. He glanced up at the moon, and decided it was time. Swiftly, he leapt down from his spot and walked over to another of the resting Goblins.</p>
<p>Headscratcher woke up after only a single poke. He knew it was his time to watch, so he didn’t scowl that hard at Badarrow. He took the bow the Goblin handed him, nodding at the implicit threat of what would happen if he damaged Badarrow’s weapon.</p>
<p>The Goblin warrior went to climb up to the watch point, but he paused as he passed the Human. He stopped, and looked down at her. He stared down at the Human girl, eying her altered features with interest. He reached down to touch at her dirty hair, which glowed in the firelight—</p>
<p>Badarrow kicked him. Headscratcher nearly tumbled into the firepit. He turned, fist raised, but Badarrow’s glare stopped him. One jerk of the annoyed Goblin’s head clearly said that Headscratcher should be <em>keeping</em> <em>watch</em> or they’d all be dead.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, Headscratcher went up to his post. He kept look out, killing any zombies that came near with precise shots from the bow. Then after about an hour had passed, he went to wake the next Goblin whose turn it was. The warriors had a system for every night, so that each Goblin took their own turn unless wounded.</p>
<p>Tonight was Badarrow, then Headscratcher. After that Rocksoup and then Rabbiteater, and then Bitefly, and then Grunter for the last watch. Like that, they passed the night away into morning.</p>
<p>Just before dawn, all the Goblins woke as one. They sat up and grabbed their gear. They armed themselves within minutes, and then prepared for battle.</p>
<p>The thirteen Goblin warriors sat around the sleeping monster-girl in silence, polishing their weapons, checking their armor for faults. They made as little sound as possible, and stood up and left her sleeping quietly next to the fire.</p>
<p>The Redfang warriors chose a good vantage point where they wouldn’t be seen, and watched the edge of the city, the gates where the other Goblin army had camped. They stood alert, but not tense, conserving their energy.</p>
<p>Waiting. They knew it would not be long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They came into the city in groups of twenty or more, sweeping through with the dawning sun at their backs, killing anything and everything they found. Goblin warriors in black armor, preparing the way.</p>
<p>A group of them came across a horde of zombies. They didn’t retreat; the zombies would pursue them and the last thing the warriors wanted was to run into another group of undead and become trapped.</p>
<p>So the Goblins found a snowy patch of land on higher ground, and let the zombies come to them. Many of the slow undead fell to arrows before they even reached the Goblins, and the others fell to the Goblins as they fought in tight formation. The Goblin warriors grinned as they slaughtered the undead. After all, they were just—</p>
<p>Zombies.</p>
<p>Eight zombies sat up in the snow behind the Goblins. They’d been lying still, motionless under the snow. Now they leapt to their feet and <em>ran</em> at the Goblins, taking the warriors by complete surprise. The Goblins cried out—turned to fight—</p>
<p>And a skeleton slipped out from the crowd of zombies and beheaded one of the Goblins. He turned and cut another one down even as the Goblins began fighting the eight zombies under his control. Another Goblin turned, axe raised, shouting as Toren charged him—</p>
<p>The skeleton’s eyes glowed purple. The Goblin froze up, and then raised his axe again. But too slow, too late. Toren’s hand blurred, and the Goblin stumbled back, throat cut.&nbsp; Toren grinned as he leapt backwards, avoiding the other Goblin warriors’ attacks. The [Fear] enchantment didn’t work on Goblins—but it could make them hesitate.</p>
<p>Their formation broken, attacked from behind and harassed by the skeleton, the group of over twenty Goblins fell quickly to the zombie horde that encircled them, no longer held at bay. Toren happily walked among their bodies, checking for a better sword and a shield. He stayed clear of the rogue zombies, the mass of dead about sixty strong now, as it shambled its way down the street. The eight zombies Toren had control of waited patiently for him to finish as he triumphantly surveyed the dead Goblins.</p>
<p>It hadn’t been easy to get all the zombies in the right spots, but they’d been an excellent distraction. Toren couldn’t command a horde, but it was easy to herd them like cattle and let his personal band of undead capitalize on their attack. And the dividends of Toren’s hard work were immediately obvious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Leader Level 4!]</p>
<p>[Skill – Daring Charge obtained!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The skeleton danced about with his new sword and shield. Another level! He’d been sending his zombies to attack Humans all night, but it was clear that attacking groups that could fight back was more rewarding. He immediately led his zombies off, searching for more Goblin groups. It looked like they were finally coming to attack, and that made Toren happy.</p>
<p>He’d finally get to kill a lot of things today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another group of Goblins, twenty five warriors of the Goblin Lord, cornered the group of thirteen Redfang warriors an hour after dawn. Both sides were breathing heavily.</p>
<p>It had been a long chase. The Redfang warriors had caught the first group of Goblins by surprise, slaying over half with arrows before they’d known what was happening. But by chance, another group of warriors had heard the fighting and rushed to assist their comrades. The Redfang warriors had fled, bringing down more Goblins, but now their backs were against a wall.</p>
<p><strong>“Traitors.”</strong></p>
<p>The Goblin warrior with black armor and a longsword in his hand called out to the Redfang warriors. He stood with the black-armored warriors at his back.</p>
<p><strong>“Goblin Lord is. Obey him. Come and not die.”</strong></p>
<p>For a second, the thirteen Goblins paused in surprise. This was new. They were being invited to join the Goblin Lord’s forces? They looked at each other, uncertain, thinking.</p>
<p>Then Rocksoup, fished around in his nose for a booger, and flicked it at the other Goblin leader. The Goblin roared in outrage, but Rocksoup’s comrades, his friends, slapped him on the back and cheered.</p>
<p>The Redfang Goblins laughed. They faced down the other Goblins, backs straight, heads held high. They did not need to say anything. Any true Goblin would understand.</p>
<p>We are here. We are Goblins. We do not abandon our tribe.</p>
<p>No true Goblin would. What were these false Goblins, these fools who’d accept traitors into their tribe? Who could obey a Chieftain—even Goblin Lord like that?</p>
<p>Never. It could never be accepted. So the Goblins faced off, the Redfang warriors standing proud as the sun hit their backs.</p>
<p>It was thirteen against twenty-five. The black-armored Goblins were confident, but the Redfang warriors had no fear. Grunter waited until the thunder in his heart was right, and then roared.</p>
<p>As one, the Redfang warriors leapt forwards. They rushed ahead, shouting without fear as they ran towards their surprised enemy. For all his bulk, Grunter was first. He lowered his axe and shoulder-charged into a group of warriors, ignoring their weapons. He trusted his thick skin and armor to keep him safe.</p>
<p>A Goblin stabbed at him, but the shaft of his spear broke as Grunter rammed into him. The Hob trampled the Goblin, and seized another. He threw him, and then the one he’d stepped on as if they weighed nothing.</p>
<p>Grunter threw two Goblins into their fellows, turned, and chopped another Goblin down. He roared at the others, making them draw back in fear. They dared to challenge <em>him? </em>He was a Hob! He scythed left and right with his heavy weapon, daring anyone to come close.</p>
<p>Headscratcher was right behind Grunter. He leapt towards the warriors Grunter had downed and without a second’s thought, stabbed them as they struggled to get up. Behind him, Badarrow shot the other Goblin leader through the head at point-blank range, laughing in fury as he did.</p>
<p>The other Redfang warriors formed a spear, Grunter at their head. They charged at the other warriors, bringing the fight to them. Bugear jabbed with a spear, keeping three Goblins at bay at once. One ran forwards, slashing, but Rocksoup was there!</p>
<p>Rocksoup and the Goblin cut—but it was the other Goblin warrior who fell away. Too slow! The dagger in Rocksoup’s off-hand caught the Goblin in his unprotected throat and he fell, choking.</p>
<p>The Goblin Lord’s warriors fell back in disarray. They hadn’t expected such a difference in levels! But the Redfang warriors refused to give them any moment’s rest. They pressed on, howling with fury.</p>
<p>They were elites! They’d fought beside Garen Redfang in the hottest of battles! Other Goblin warriors couldn’t compare to their skill.</p>
<p>But—they were outnumbered. And not even their levels and skill in battle could bridge the gap in numbers so easily. The instant the other Goblin warriors lost the shock of first contact, they began to swarm the Redfang warriors, fighting two-to-one, or in Grunter’s case, <em>six</em>-to-one.</p>
<p>Still, the Redfang warriors refused to back down. They fought shoulder-to-shoulder, refusing to budge. If this was their last moment, they’d go down as free Goblins, not these pale imitations. Headscratcher had lost his blade—buried in a Goblin’s spine and was falling back when he saw something <em>blur</em> at the backs of the Goblin warriors besieging them. He heard screams, and then the press forcing the Redfang warriors disappeared.</p>
<p>A silver blade cut four Goblins to the ground in swift slashes that rent their armor. The Redfang warriors saw a Goblin in black armor turn—and then a shield crashed into his face. He fell, neck broken, and then they saw the man in silver armor.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>Ylawes raised his shield as the black armor Goblins fled around him. The Redfang warriors were clearly different from the rest, and he narrowed his eyes at Grunter. The Redfang Goblins didn’t hesitate. The moment they saw who they were facing, they moved to attack.</p>
<p>The warriors spread out around Ylawes, half of them pulling out bows. Grunter, Rocksoup, Bugear and three more Goblins formed a circle around the adventurer, keeping a wide distance. They closed as one.</p>
<p>Ylawes didn’t let the Goblins take the initiative. The instant they moved to attack him, he charged left. Bugear raised his own shield and the sword that Ylawes brought down cracked it and flattened the Goblin. If it wasn’t for his own Skill, the Goblin would have been cut apart in a single blow.</p>
<p>The warrior in silver armor clearly hadn’t expected the Goblin to survive, but he turned and blocked Grunter’s powerful blow as the Hob charged him. The axe with all of Grunter’s weight behind it bounced off the shield, and the man instantly riposted, his blade cutting Grunter deep in the side.</p>
<p>The Hob howled and the other Goblins swarmed Ylawes. The man spun away, keeping all of them at bay. Arrows flew at his face—he blocked each one with his shield, spinning to knock them down.</p>
<p>The Redfang warriors paused then, in consternation and for the first time, fear. For his part, Ylawes eyed them with his own degree of shock.</p>
<p>“Hmf. You’re no ordinary Goblins, are you? Are all the monsters this far south so strange?”</p>
<p>The Redfang warriors made no reply. Instead, they just pulled back. Grunter kept one hand on his side, assessing his damage. They looked at each other, seeing the terrible truth in each others’ eyes.</p>
<p>This adventurer was Gold-rank. He had to be.</p>
<p>It was a death sentence for the Redfang warriors. They knew it. A group of Silver-rank adventurers they could handle, or run from. But a Gold-rank?</p>
<p>Badarrow snarled as he loosed arrow after arrow at Ylawes. The man blocked each shot, advancing quickly on the Goblins. The Redfang warriors spread out again, but this time they had only one goal in mind. Even if they died, even if they all died distracting the adventurer, they had to give Grunter an opening—</p>
<p>Headscratcher, Bugear, and Bitefly all attacked at once. They slashed at Ylawes, ducking back as he slashed at them, trying to distract him. Other Goblins attacked at the same time, and Ylawes was forced to knock aside their blades, force them back with his sword rather than attack. Grunter spotted an opening as the man turned to cut Headscratcher down. The small Goblin raised his sword bravely, and Grunter exploded towards Ylawes with a <em>roar—</em></p>
<p>The man turned and lashed out with his shield, smashing into Grunter’s right arm. All of the Goblins heard the Hob’s bones <em>break</em> from the impact. Grunter staggered, but he still tried to bring his axe down—</p>
<p>“Courage. Even from Goblins.”</p>
<p>That was all Ylawes said as he ran Grunter through. The Hob’s eyes widened and he sat down as Ylawes pulled the blade out of his stomach. The Redfang warriors howled and attacked, but too slow. Ylawes raised his crimson blade from the final blow—</p>
<p><em>No!</em></p>
<p>Was it a word or a thought? She didn’t know. But the monster leapt, and her flight across the ten feet of ground caught Ylawes by surprise. Even so, the adventurer still turned fast enough. His shield smacked the young woman out of the air. She landed, stunned, and saw his sword point down at her.</p>
<p>But Ylawes didn’t finish the blow. He stopped at the last moment, and his eyes went wide as he saw her face. He seemed horrified; his face went pale.</p>
<p>“You. What are—?”</p>
<p>Grunter <em>threw</em> himself at the Gold-rank adventurer. Ylawes turned, and his shield came up, smashing into the Hob’s face and stopping his charge. But the impact still made the adventurer slide a bit in the snow.</p>
<p>The Hob stumbled, bleeding. Ylawes shoved him back, and then turned towards the thing crouching in the snow again. She slashed at him, forcing him to guard his body with his shield. Her claws could scratch even his plate armor.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with you? Please, if you can—answer me!”</p>
<p>She only screamed, screamed at him without words to stop, to not kill these people. But he was too strong. He forced her away, hitting her in the stomach with his shield so hard she was stunned. And then he turned back to the Goblins.</p>
<p>They faced him, ready to die. But Ylawes’ eyes narrowed, and his head turned. Almost too late.</p>
<p>The blurring [Mirage Cut] opened up a deep slash across the silver armored man’s cheek. He turned, snarling, and Toren rolled away, clattering his teeth with frustration.</p>
<p>“You!”</p>
<p>Ylawes charged at the skeleton, but halted as an arrow flew at his face. He turned towards Badarrow as the Goblin reached for another arrow in his quiver.</p>
<p>That’s when the zombies charged out the alleyway. Eight of them ran at Ylawes, arms swinging wildly. He hacked through four in an instant, his limbs a blur of motion, but Toren was at his back. The skeleton cut at Ylawes as the Redfang warriors made him retreat, trying to strike the man’s face, cut at the joints in his armor—</p>
<p>“<em>Stop!</em>”</p>
<p>The Gold-rank adventurer bellowed at the Human, or at least the thing that had once been Human. He saw her turn to look back at him once, but then she was helping pull the Hob away.</p>
<p>He didn’t have time to chase her. Somehow, an entire horde of zombies had been attracted to his location, and they surrounded him now. Ylawes cut them asunder, his blade and shield moving ceaselessly, but there was always the skeleton, trying to cut at him, forcing the adventurer to fight with his back to the wall—</p>
<p>In the end, Toren leapt away as the last few zombies kept Ylawes in place. The Gold-rank adventurer cut the last corpse to the ground and one booted foot smashed a skull in. The man and skeleton stared at each other across the street full of corpses.</p>
<p>“What <em>are</em> you?”</p>
<p>Toren just grinned. Then he ran and disappeared down a street, leaving Ylawes behind in the snow. The adventurer turned to stare at the bodies of the fallen.</p>
<p>“First Goblins fighting Goblins. Then—a young woman? A monster? Something. And then that skeleton. What’s going on?”</p>
<p>No one answered him. But soon the adventurer turned and raced through the streets. He could hear screams everywhere, even at the walls he’d had guards posted at. The Goblins were trying to kill everyone they could before the main fist of their army attacked. He had to save them all.</p>
<p>But he could not do it alone. The adventurer halted and reached for his belt. He took out a scroll and stared at shimmering letters. Words. A reply.</p>
<p>Soon.</p>
<p>He tucked the scroll back into his belt pouch and ran on, sword and shield raised. To save the living. Or die defending them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Goblin commander <em>roared</em> his fury as the [Scouts] brought back news. The kill teams he’d sent into the city were being routed! Slaughtered! By a Human with silver armor and the <em>undead</em>!</p>
<p>He rounded on the two cringing [Shamans] who’d been forced to carry their master’s burden. He pointed at the city, demanding they control the undead, to send them in. But the [Shamans] could not. They had not the strength, not a fraction of the head [Shaman] that had been sent to lead the army, and certainly not nearly as much as the Goblin Lord himself—</p>
<p>The commander of the Goblins had no time for excuses. He called out, and his mount, a vast Shield Spider, rose up. It <em>bit</em> one of the [Shamans], cutting off his shriek. The other one fled as the commander called his lieutenants. He pointed to the city, and gave crisp orders.</p>
<p>No more waiting! No more delays for reinforcements. The [Shamans] could collect their dead after he’d slaughtered everyone in the city. The adventurer and all the Humans would die.</p>
<p>The Goblin army prepared to march on Esthelm. And in its streets, a skeleton danced, bringing death and commanding it. And further away, a group of Goblins carrying a bleeding Hob. A monster ran with them, helping them carry the dying Goblin, watching as they slapped his face, trying to keep him awake.</p>
<p>People.</p>
<p>And as the sun rose, it rose on the undead, the army of Goblins, the desperate walls built by Humans. And a few people, caught in the madness.</p>
<p>This is their story.</p>

		<p>This is the story of a monster. She knew she was a monster. She’d eaten people. Her own kind, rotting, crawling with insects and maggots and decay.</p>
<p>She’d done it to survive. But the cost had been almost too much to bear. More than once, the young woman who’d once had a name wished she had died back then rather than take that first bite.</p>
<p>But she was alive. And she still longed to live, even now. But the monster in her—</p>
<p>It <em>hungered</em>. It always wanted out. There was a part of her soul that would devour the world if it could. It would eat and eat until there was nothing left to eat but itself.</p>
<p>That was what she feared. Walking any deeper down this road to hell would mean never coming back. Of that she was sure.</p>
<p>She was a monster. A horrible thing, a creature to be hunted and killed by heroes and adventurers. But that was the thing. The girl that looked like a monster had encountered real monsters. Goblins. And somehow, they were more like people than the Humans living in Esthelm.</p>
<p>Goblins. The most pathetic species, the cowardly, backstabbing creatures that ate their own dead. That was what the [Florist] had been told when she’d walked on two legs and known her name. But the thing that scuttled around on all fours with jagged claws and sharp teeth saw something different.</p>
<p>She saw people. People—warriors, proud and courageous. The Goblins who’d saved her once ran through the streets, armed, keeping the way clear while six of their number helped support and drag the massive Hobgoblin they carried between them.</p>
<p>His eyes were fluttering, and the massive Goblin was fading. Blood trailed from his stomach, spattering on the snow and dirty ground. He was cut deeply.</p>
<p>A Gold-rank adventurer had done that to him. The monster had seen it. He’d been killing monsters and he’d fought the Goblins. And she’d fought him, to let them get away.</p>
<p>Even now she didn’t know why she’d done it. She’d attacked her own people—a hero! But he’d been wrong. The Goblins were not monsters. They were heroes too.</p>
<p>They’d fought. With their backs against the wall, even against an <em>adventurer</em>—they’d fought. That was all the monster thought as she helped drag the half-conscious Hob back towards their camp.</p>
<p>They were monsters, yes. But even they—no, they weren’t nearly as pathetic as she was. And she had saved them. Or tried. She’d fought against a hero, an adventurer—</p>
<p>For them.</p>
<p>What had possessed her? Perhaps only a desire not to let these people die. To repay them for the kindness they’d shown her. Because they weren’t monsters.</p>
<p>Only she was a monster.</p>
<p>The Goblin warriors were shouting in panic as they ran through the streets. They were shouting at the Hob, trying to keep him awake. The massive Goblin was stumbling, barely lucid, but none of the Goblins dared slow down. They kept watching their backs, waiting at any moment for the man in silver armor to pursue them.</p>
<p>But he never came. And when the Goblins had gotten to their camp and the Hob collapsed on the ground, they immediately tore at his belt.</p>
<p>The monster squatted in a corner, fingers in her mouth, watching, not knowing what to do. One of the Goblins was undoing all the compartments in the belt, searching for something. What?</p>
<p>A healing potion! Of course! The red vial was tiny, but from the way it glittered in the light, the monster knew it was very powerful. She caught her breath as they poured the liquid into the Hob’s gaping stomach wound. And in an instant—</p>
<p>It closed! The thing had never seen any wound heal that fast, but the potion was the kind only the rich would use. The Hob groaned, but color flooded back into his green face. He sat up—</p>
<p>And clutched at his arm. The potion hadn’t mended his broken bones. The other Goblin warriors sighed in relief. One reached for the Hob’s arm, but he shoved the Goblin away. Wincing, the Hob felt at his injuries and then pointed. A Goblin fished around in their packs and came up with cloth and a metal bar they’d used to hold the cooking pot with.</p>
<p>The Hob began to create a splint with the materials. Other Goblins wanted to help, but he clearly wanted to do it by himself. He snapped at the other Goblins when they tried to approach.</p>
<p>The monster watched this, even more sure that she had been right and the adventurer wrong. These were not monsters to be killed, at least, these Goblins weren’t.</p>
<p>They cared for each other. Impulsively, the young woman reached out. She touched Grunter’s arm as he grunted in pain and annoyance, fumbling with the splint.</p>
<p>The Hob moved to push the creature away, but paused when he saw her. He hesitated, and then reluctantly let her take the splint. Slowly, slowly, trying to remember how the motions worked, the young woman tied the splint to his arm. The Hob gasped, but made a sound when she stopped.</p>
<p><em>Tighter. </em>That was clearly what he said, what he meant. The monster-girl tied the knot, as the Hob gasped, but when it was done he stood and grunted at her.</p>
<p>Thanks. That was all it was, but it made the monster’s eyes fill with tears. The Hob paused and gently bent to wipe them away.</p>
<p>And then the monster was no monster, but a young woman who looked like one. The Redfang warriors crowded around her, slapping her back, gargling in approval at her. Looking at her—</p>
<p>As a person. It was all the young woman wanted. So she wept and for a second, forgot the hunger in her soul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the tale of a monster. This is the tale of a young woman with something dark in her soul. She felt it, even as she sat in the Goblin’s camp, listening to them laugh and slap each other with the sheer, giddy relief of being alive.</p>
<p>She was still a monster. She still wanted to <em>eat</em>, to tear the flesh off of her newfound friends and—</p>
<p>But she couldn’t. She wouldn’t. And yet the thing knew it couldn’t stay. Eventually, she would become—</p>
<p>A Goblin pressed a bowl of reheated soup into her hands. He grinned at her as he scratched at his head. She stared at him. He looked familiar. He was the first Goblin who’d come for her. Her eyes went to his head, and she recoiled.</p>
<p>He had <em>ticks!</em> The Goblin looked vaguely apologetic as he scratched at one dark shape buried on his bald head. The girl grabbed at him, and much to his surprise, dragged him over to the fire the other Goblins were restarting. There she picked up a stick and to the other Goblins’ astonishment, lit one end until it was hot.</p>
<p>The head-scratching Goblin had no idea what she intended, and thus when he saw the hot stick heading for his head he immediately tried to pull away. But the monster-girl made soothing noises and he stopped. He was very tense in her arms as she poked at the ticks with her stick.</p>
<p>The flaming end made the Goblin yelp and try to pull away, but it didn’t seem to make the tick want to leave. Frowning, the young woman cast aside the stick and grabbed at the Goblin’s head.</p>
<p>Nails, then. She picked at the skin, her elongated nails digging into the flesh. The Goblin <em>screeched</em> and tried to get away then—but he paused when she pulled the first tick off of his head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Headscratcher and the other Goblins stared in horror at the huge tick, big and fat from living off his scalp as the Human girl pulled it out of his head. Immediately, the other Goblins crowded around Headscratcher’s head and recoiled as they saw how infested it was.</p>
<p>Beseechingly, Headscratcher put his head on the Human’s lap. She seemed stunned, but then obligingly dug her fingers into Headscratcher’s skin, gently, pulling bugs out. She flicked them into the fire. Once or twice, Headscratcher thought she was looking at them as if she was hungry but she never ate them.</p>
<p>Once it was over, the Goblin’s head was bleeding, but mercifully, no longer itching. He grinned at the Human and only got a strange look in reply. He thought she would have been happy, but when she looked at his face—</p>
<p>It almost looked like she was about to cry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The young woman sat in the snow next to the fire. She rubbed at the dirty ball in her hands. Soap. Lye soap, strongly scented, pilfered no doubt from some caravan the Goblins had raided.</p>
<p>But soap nonetheless. And they had cloth and oil. More things that made them civilized, made them people. Slowly, the girl abandoned the soap and dunked her hands into hot water. It made her hands <em>burn</em>, but it was necessary. She was filthy.</p>
<p>Yes, wasn’t that how it went? Clean hands and—and doing things. Small things. Not eating the dead. If she could do things like this, then—</p>
<p>The young woman stared at the Goblin curled up into a ball next to her. He was practically frozen with fright, and the other four Goblins holding him looked grim and determined. He hadn’t wanted her help, but they’d insisted.</p>
<p>Several tiny mites crawled out of the shivering Goblins’ ear even as the young woman watched. They made her…hungry, but she put away the thought. Infestation. Bugs. She’d seen it before, seen a [Healer] treat it. She could try the same, couldn’t she?</p>
<p>The Goblin whose ticks she’d pulled out—the head scratching Goblin—handed her a stick with a bit of cloth wrapped around the end. It was very thin, and the girl dipped lightly in a pot of oil sitting next to her. Her Goblin patient shuddered when he saw the stick, but the other Goblins held him down.</p>
<p>Gently, very gently, the young woman swabbed the Goblin’s ear with the cloth and oil. He gritted his teeth and growled inaudible words into her lap, but didn’t move. Bugs came out with the stick, stuck on the oil. The other Goblins made a face when the girl kept pulling out bugs. One of them slapped the Goblin on the ear as if it was his fault he’d let them in there.</p>
<p>Too many bugs. No matter how hard the girl tried, she kept getting more with each stick and she was sure there were probably eggs in there. So she changed tactics.</p>
<p>Hot water, poured in the Goblin’s pointed ear. He yelped and struggled, but his friends just laughed and held him down. The girl counted to ten and then let him sit up and drain his ear.</p>
<p>Tiny little bugs washed out with the water. The girl made a face and did it again, this time with soapy water. She made the Goblin keep the water in his ear for several minutes; long enough to drown whatever was in there.</p>
<p>When she let him sit up, the Goblin glared at her and stuck a finger in his ear. But when he only pulled out dead bugs, he brightened up. He grinned at her and waved a hand. She smiled back.</p>
<p>And cried.</p>
<p>It was something the other Goblins couldn’t understand. But the young woman felt—<em>normal</em> after helping the Goblin. His gratitude hurt her in ways no sword could ever do.</p>
<p>Of course, she couldn’t explain that. The other Goblins crowded around the former bug-eared Goblin. One smacked him on the back of the head. Another punched him. The young woman stopped them. Tried to explain.</p>
<p>There was a patch of dirt on the ground next to the fire. The young woman took a stick and drew in it. She drew a stick figure, and then small ones for the Goblins. They crowded around to look, and the one who scratched his head sat across from her, staring at the young woman’s face.</p>
<p><em>Her. Goblins.</em> They nodded and pointed at each other, drawing an exaggeratedly fat Goblin for the Hob who lay resting against one wall. The girl nodded, face bleak, and they quieted. She pointed to the figure representing her in the dark.</p>
<p><em>Me.</em></p>
<p>She added fangs and horns to the little figure in the dirt.</p>
<p><em>Monster. </em></p>
<p>They stared at her. Their eyes found the way her teeth had changed, her jaw, her fingers and even arms, making her less…Human. More like an Eater, whatever that was. But then they shrugged at her.</p>
<p>So what? A Goblin patted the young woman’s hand and grinned at her. He pointed to himself and the others and drew little horns on all of the figures. They were all monsters.</p>
<p>The young woman’s eyes filled, but she didn’t weep. She pointed at the figure, and then drew other figures, other Humans. Far away from her. She drew a line between herself and the others.</p>
<p><em>Alone.</em></p>
<p>The other Goblins stopped smiling. They stared at her, and at the line separating her. They understood. None of them said a word. They just understood.</p>
<p>The young woman pointed to a body. She pointed to the dead flesh, mimed eating. The Goblins nodded. She drew a line down her face.</p>
<p><em>Sad.</em></p>
<p>A tear travelled down the grime, washing it away. The Goblins stared at her, and then at the bodies.</p>
<p>They understood.</p>
<p>And she understood. Somehow, in the ways they tried to tell her, in the motions of their arms. They felt it too.</p>
<p>Because of course Goblins ate their dead. Of course they did. To survive, they would eat anything. Everyone knew that. Eating their own kind and other people was what made Goblins monsters.</p>
<p>But who would have asked Goblins how they felt? Did anyone realize the Goblins wept to eat their own dead? Of course Goblins ate their own kind. They did it to survive. But every single Goblin drew a line down their cheeks.</p>
<p>They did, and they wept inside.</p>
<p>They were people too. People who wanted to live.</p>
<p>They were monsters with souls. And they—</p>
<p>They were no different from her. No worse than she’d been, and perhaps better. They weren’t monsters.</p>
<p>And perhaps she wasn’t either.</p>
<p>This is the story of a monster girl. She sat in the ruins of her home and wept. For everything she’d lost. For everything she’d become. She wept because she had done horrible things to survive, horrible things that had made her despair and want to die. But she had met monsters, and it turned out they were more Human than she was. And then they’d shown her their hearts and it had turned out she was no monster either.</p>
<p>The young woman wept, sobbing for all she’d lost. She was lost, alone. But then she felt the arms around her, and looked up into the face of Headscratcher. He squeezed her tight, eyes closed.</p>
<p>This is the story of a Goblin who hugged a monster. And the monster yearned to bite him, to eat—</p>
<p>But she forced the desires down in her chest. She buried the madness and found something else sprouting in the darkness of her heart. It bloomed, a faint sprout reaching towards the light, drinking in the moment of kindness.</p>
<p>A flower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#99ccff;">[Condition – Terrible Hunger Removed!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The voice made her eyes go wide. The girl stood up, knocking the Goblin’s hands away. He let go instantly, afraid he’d gone too far. But the young woman stared up at the sky and saw only blue. A bit of blue hiding behind the dark clouds.</p>
<p>Sunlight. Far off, but still there, shining down. Redemption for a shattered soul. Thanks, for a Goblin.</p>
<p>He was saying something. Trying to apologize. The young woman looked at him, and embraced him to his great surprise. The other Goblins gaped, but she hugged him, lifting him up into the air.</p>
<p>She still looked like a monster. Her teeth were still sharp, and she had lost the words. But she was no longer hungry. That was enough.</p>
<p>She hugged him, and wept. A monster, hugging a Goblin. But a monster with a soul. And a bit more Human in them than had been there a minute ago. So it whispered to the young woman, as she tried to remember her name, knowing she had one.</p>
<p>Salvation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The man wearing silver armor stood at the head of the battlements and stared down at the people. They looked up to him for hope, for redemption. For a chance to live again.</p>
<p>“The Goblins are coming.”</p>
<p>That was all he said to them, Esthelm’s remaining thousands. They held weapons in their hands, children, women, men, clinging to life with all they had. He had never been prouder, never been more honored to fight.</p>
<p>“They are coming! Their first assault failed. They’ll be coming in force, next. All of them.”</p>
<p>The dead lay in the streets, and what few he had saved had now joined the living. The Goblins had swept through the city, killing teams of them. But they were dead now, avenged. He had slain nearly a hundred himself, and the others—</p>
<p>Ylawes looked out past the barricade he stood on, out into the city. Zombies wandered the streets, by the hundreds. Thousands. And somewhere, hiding, striking whenever his back was turned, was the skeleton. It had killed Goblins and Humans alike. But it was one skeleton compared to the army about to march.</p>
<p>The Gold-rank adventurer turned to the people again. He pointed to the barricades—built with stone and wood and anything that could be scavenged, manned by anyone with a bow or weapon that could hold off the hordes.</p>
<p>“We have the high ground, and we’ve created chokepoints that we can hold.”</p>
<p>One main entry point with palisades. A killing field, or so he hoped. He would hold it until he died. And these people—Ylawes pointed at them, shouting.</p>
<p>“They will come. They will come and we will fight and die here. Do you understand? <em>Here. </em>To the last child. There is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide! Your city lives or dies on this day! People of Esthelm, reclaim your pride. Throw back the Goblins and retake your city!”</p>
<p>He raised his sword and they roared. They would have cheered anyone, but they cheered him. They called out for hope and raised their weapons against the darkness.</p>
<p>“Do you really think we can live, sir?”</p>
<p>“I told you to call me Ylawes.”</p>
<p>The man turned and looked the Bronze-rank adventurer in the eye. He was glad the young man had stayed, he and his two friends. And because he respected the man’s courage, he didn’t lie.</p>
<p>“The odds are slim. But it’s possible. We have the Goblins’ numbers. We may even outnumber them by a bit.”</p>
<p>“Counting women and children sir. And people who can barely fight—”</p>
<p>“That’s what the barricades and I will have to equalize. Other than that, we can only hope that the people of Esthelm fight with all the courage they have today. If we can kill a good number of them, our enemy may disperse. They might have armor and some training, but they’re still low-level Goblins. At least, most of them are. In truth, it’s the undead that concern me most.”</p>
<p>“So many…”</p>
<p>“Yes. I was too late.”</p>
<p>Ylawes said it simply. He stared down at the streets.</p>
<p>“The Goblins will control them with [Shamans] and [Mages] if they can. Use them to fight. If we have to battle both undead and Goblins, we stand no chance.”</p>
<p>“If that happens—then what will we do?”</p>
<p>“Hold out. For as long as possible. Aid may arrive soon.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>The man looked at him, wanting to believe. So did Ylawes. He reached for a belt pouch and pulled something out.</p>
<p>“I sent for help last night.”</p>
<p>He showed the adventurer a scroll with glowing letters etched onto the parchment. A message. And—underneath it, a reply had been written in terse, neat script.</p>
<p>“Help is coming. But I don’t know if it will come here in an hour or in days.”</p>
<p>“We don’t have days.”</p>
<p>They didn’t even have an hour. And both adventurers knew that. Ylawes looked to the horizon, and raised his voice.</p>
<p>“To arms! The Goblins are coming!”</p>
<p>The dark mass at the edge of the city limits was moving. On the walls, the Humans saw a dark tide of bodies surging into the city, and then heard rhythmic impacts.</p>
<p>Drumbeats. Not just one or two, but countless numbers of them, thudding impacts that made the defenders shake in fear.</p>
<p>The drumbeats were like thunder. And as Ylawes watched, the first wave of the Goblin army began pouring into the city. Some rode Shield Spiders—others horses. And at the head of the army—</p>
<p>“Undead. The [Shamans] are controlling them.”</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth. Was this the end? But it was only a few undead—barely a hundred. If that was all they could control, then—</p>
<p>There was a chance. Ylawes shouted as he ran down the barricade, to the one opening in their defenses. He would cut them down again and again. Create a point for them to throw all their fury into until there was nothing left.</p>
<p>“Man the barricades. We hold them at the choke points—force them back!”</p>
<p>The people of Esthelm shouted, and the Goblin drums pounded. Now the Goblins screamed, and their voices ran throughout the city. They met the adventurer wearing silver and the clash was like thunder. Goblins poured up the barricades, fighting the people on the walls. Archers from both sides filled the skies—</p>
<p>And the undead moved. They focused on the conflict like lightning. Zombies, ghouls, advancing like the tide. Goblins turned and fought the dead—[Shamans] struggled to control them, trying, failing in the face of so many. And the man in silver fought on, sword and shield flashing in the light.</p>
<p>The last battle for Esthelm had begun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He saw the man wearing silver armor. He saw the Goblins, seemingly numberless as they poured towards the wooden barricades, screaming warcries. And Toren felt happy.</p>
<p>War. Death. The Humans met the Goblins with a roar, clashing swords. In moments the first bodies began to fall.</p>
<p>And oh, how Toren longed to be among the fighting, sword in hand! But he had to be patient. He looked around, at the dead who surrounded him.</p>
<p>They were his kind. Thoughtless, yes, but Toren felt a connection to them he hadn’t a few days ago. He and they weren’t so different after all. They lived to fight and kill—</p>
<p>And so did he. This was his purpose. Toren knew it. He could lead the dead. Why else would he have this Skill, this class, if not because he was meant to do it? There was a special joy to ordering the zombies about, to leading them to victory through superior tactics and planning.</p>
<p>It was addictive, giddying, intoxicating. Toren looked at the battlefield and saw how he could shape it. He called out to the zombies under his control, readying them to move into the fray.</p>
<p>This was what he was meant to do. At last, he’d found it. It was so wonderful to command. Had Erin felt like this when she ordered him? Had she—</p>
<p>Toren paused. The burning lights in his eyes dimmed for a second. No. Not her. He was separate now. She was…not his owner any longer. He was free. Would be free.</p>
<p>And he would level up. Toren looked back at the battlefield. The Goblins were trying to swarm up the barricades blocking the streets off as Humans threw them off the barricades and shot arrows and threw stones down at them. Now was the time.</p>
<p>The first group of zombies lurched towards the Goblins. They moved slowly—just another random assortment of the undead drawn to the conflict. The Goblins barely paid any attention to them. So long as they had a few warriors guard their flanks, there was no danger.</p>
<p>Toren grinned. At his silent command, the zombies began to run.</p>
<p>This is the story of a skeleton. He only knew how to kill, so he did just that. In a city filled with death, the skeleton killed with his hands at first, and then used others to kill more and more. He would kill everything if he could.</p>
<p>Because it was all he knew.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Hold the lines! <em>Hold, damn you!</em>”</p>
<p>Ylawes screamed at the people struggling around him as he cut with his sword, bringing down Goblins as they came at him. How long had he been fighting? A few seconds? An hour? He couldn’t tell.</p>
<p>Goblins poured towards him, around the palisades, into the center of a whirlwind of steel he created. Parry, strike, block, <em>strike—</em>his shield was a weapon just as much as his sword. Normal Goblins couldn’t even get close as he cut through their weapons, but there were more who attacked even as their companions fell. And when a Hob came—</p>
<p>Ylawes stumbled back as a javelin crashed into his chest, breaking on his armor but denting it. His plate mail was not enchanted like his arms, and he coughed. A Goblin screamed as it swung a shortsword—</p>
<p>He beheaded it. Keep fighting. Don’t stop! The Goblins seemed endless, but the barricades were all still holding. Even as people fell and died, more rushed to take their place. They had the high ground. So long as they had that, even a child could knock a Goblin down with a well-placed blow—</p>
<p>“<em>Zombies!</em>”</p>
<p>Someone screamed the word. Ylawes turned, and saw fourteen zombies, <em>sprinting</em> at him. He reacted instantly.</p>
<p>“<em>[Shield of Valor]!</em>”</p>
<p>The zombies <em>crashed</em> into a wall of air as Ylawes brought his shield up and <em>pushed</em>. The zombies and every Goblin in a cone in front of him were sent flying backwards by his Skill. Panting, Ylawes lowered his shield and turned.</p>
<p>“Report!”</p>
<p>An [Archer], one of the few warriors among the citizens—called out to him as she snatched at more arrows. The Goblins were pulling back, but her hands never stopped working, firing into their shielded ranks.</p>
<p>“Zombies are coming from every direction! They’re attacking the barricades, but some are attacking the Goblins!”</p>
<p>“Show me!”</p>
<p>Ylawes leapt up onto a platform. The woman pointed and he saw she was right. Zombies were approaching from all sides, drawn by so many living bodies. And they were attacking Goblins! Some of the undead were even fighting those controlled by the [Shamans]. But something was very, very wrong.</p>
<p>“What’s happening?”</p>
<p>The [Archer] pointed as a group of zombies began running, just as the ones earlier had. They charged into a group of Goblins from behind, biting and tearing.</p>
<p>“Zombies can’t run!”</p>
<p>“Some can.”</p>
<p>Ylawes was grim as he surveyed the zombies. They’d caught an entire group of archers by surprise—was it chance or had something known that there was an opportunity to strike?</p>
<p>“They <em>can?</em>”</p>
<p>The woman stared at Ylawes in horror. He nodded.</p>
<p>“Some can. But not like this. Only a few out of a hundred should and they don’t—group like that. This isn’t right.”</p>
<p>“Look! Another group!”</p>
<p>This time, Ylawes clearly saw what was happening. A group of zombies moving slowly towards the Goblins suddenly stiffened. In an instant, they’d changed from their slow pace into a sprint, and they changed course. Instead of hitting the group of Goblin warriors they’d been aiming towards, they ran towards a barricade and began pounding at a gap that had been exposed in the wooden structure.</p>
<p>“Why are they acting like that?”</p>
<p>“<em>There.</em>”</p>
<p>Ylawes pointed. At the center of a huge mass of zombies, a skeleton was standing, pointing and waving a sword about. The woman standing next to him paled.</p>
<p>“Dead gods. Is it <em>leading</em> them?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Ylawes saw it clearly. Wherever the skeleton pointed, a group of zombies would begin to run. They attacked vulnerable spots, hitting both Humans and Goblins alike. Always fourteen zombies. Each time the group of fourteen zombies had crashed into the Goblin flanks, another group would begin to move with that same focused intelligence.</p>
<p>“It’s coordinating the undead. It’s trying to overwhelm us! Watch the sides!”</p>
<p>Ylawes called out. He wanted to run up to see how the entire battlefield was going, but the brief window he’d created with his Skill was already up. He saw people struggling against the Goblin warriors again, and leapt back into the fray.</p>
<p>“Don’t falter!”</p>
<p>A Goblin riding a massive Shield Spider was coming straight at Ylawes, laughing as he hacked apart Humans with a halberd that cut through armor like it wasn’t there. The [Knight] roared a challenge, and the two met in a clash at the center of the battlefield. But the undead kept coming, and the barricades began to splinter under the ceaseless attacks…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They sat on the rooftop of their hideout, watching the battle. Goblins. But not <em>those</em> Goblins. The Redfang warriors felt no attachment to the warriors of the Goblin Lord. In fact, they sneered at the other side’s tactics.</p>
<p>Sieging an entrenched group of Humans? What were they, idiots? They’d clearly counted on overwhelming the Humans in one push, but they’d underestimated the Gold-rank adventurer and the difficulty of overcoming the barricades. By himself, the warrior in silver armor had slain countless Goblins already and so long as he stood, the Goblins couldn’t advance past his position.</p>
<p>Too, the undead were complicating matters. Badarrow pointed and the Goblins saw the undead were attacking Goblins from behind, forcing them to split their forces. Something was moving the undead like a [Tactician], and it was making the attacking force’s job that much harder.</p>
<p>Still, all the Redfang Goblins could tell the battle was going one way. The zombies were getting diced by the Goblins for all the damage they inflicted. The same could not be said of the inexperienced Human defenders. Worn down by both sides, the barricades were failing. Once one collapsed—</p>
<p>All the Humans would die. The Redfang warriors weren’t sure how they felt about this. On one hand, Humans were usually their enemies. On the other hand, the Goblin Lords’ forces were <em>definitely </em>their enemy. And besides—</p>
<p>They glanced left, at the young woman sitting next to them. She crouched on the roof, staring down at the battle.</p>
<p>She was Human, wasn’t she? More and more Human, or so they felt. Headscratcher was sitting next to the Human and none of the Goblin warriors knew what to say. All they knew was they loved her. A tiny bit. For saving Grunter. For daring to hug a Goblin. For being like them.</p>
<p>A lot, actually. They loved her a lot, in the simple way they could. Because she didn’t look at them like monsters. They’d never known they wanted that until this moment.</p>
<p>And she was staring at the battlefield. Grunter nudged her and grunted. He pointed towards the gates, undefended. She could run. The Redfang warriors should have left long ago. But the Human girl just stared at the battlements.</p>
<p>The Goblins were pressing in. Too deep to be pushed back and there weren’t enough Humans on the side furthest from the adventurer. And there were too many undead. The Redfang warriors could see a familiar skeleton among the zombies and they wondered—</p>
<p>“Go.”</p>
<p>The word came from Headscratcher. It made the other Redfang warriors stiffen in shock, but he was pointing at the gates. He was urging the Human to go. To leave.</p>
<p>With them?</p>
<p>It was just a thought, a passing moment. The Human—the girl who was part monster—looked at Headscratcher, and hesitated. Then she shook her head slowly.</p>
<p>She pointed at the battlefield, at the Humans on the walls they had built. Faltering. Falling back. The monster pointed at them and touched her heart.</p>
<p>Some things didn’t need words. The Goblins understood. But then she pointed at them, and at the Goblins and undead. She touched Headscratcher’s sword, sheathed at his waist.</p>
<p>They stared at her. What did she mean? Grunter lowered his head as he understood, but the others didn’t get it. The young woman wearing a monster’s skin pointed again, at the backs of the undead, at the Goblins. She touched the sword and then her heart.</p>
<p>And they understood. She wanted them to help. To save…</p>
<p>Badarrow was the first to move. He shook his head and made a displeased noise. He stared at the battlefield as the other Goblins shuffled and looked down. The Redfang warriors looked at their feet, at the sky, at the battlefield, but none dared look at the monster who pleaded with them with her eyes.</p>
<p>Headscratcher looked away. He couldn’t meet the young woman’s eyes. He looked down.</p>
<p>How could they tell her? The Redfang warriors had no words to explain this. But it was easy enough that even the untrained monster girl could understand.</p>
<p>They were thirteen. Brave warriors, and good fighters, yes, but only thirteen. The army of the Goblin Lord was just that. An <em>army.</em> And the undead alone seemed limitless.</p>
<p>They were no heroes. And they weren’t willing to die. In the end, they were still Goblins. And only a fool would go down there.</p>
<p>But they couldn’t say it. Not to the girl who looked at them as if they were heroes. They couldn’t bear to see the disappointment in her eyes.</p>
<p>None of them dared look up. Grunter touched his broken arm and stared at the man in silver armor. He fought on, a lone patch of flashing light amidst the dark armor and shambling bodies.</p>
<p>They weren’t the same, in the end. A Goblin was still a Goblin. Not an adventurer.</p>
<p>The monster stared at the Goblins silently. They didn’t see what was in her eyes, but they all saw her turn to look at the barricades. The Humans were being pressed back. The zombies were climbing as well, commanded by the skeleton no doubt. And with the Goblins attacking as well—</p>
<p>It would be over soon. Then they would have to leave. But what would the girl do? Could she survive like them? Could she come with them?</p>
<p>It was just a thought. But they saw it in Headscratcher’s eyes. He wanted that. But the girl was different. She looked back at her people, dying, fighting, and touched her heart. They could not know it, but the young woman could hear it beating, so loudly she thought it might burst. That was all. She just heard her heart beating in her chest. But she had nearly forgotten the sound. It reminded her of who she was.</p>
<p>It reminded her that she was Human.</p>
<p>The monster stood up. The Redfang warriors watched her silently. Slowly, she pointed towards the Humans and drew one line down her cheek. And touched her heart.</p>
<p>That was all. She bent, and Headscratcher looked up at her, full of—</p>
<p>She kissed him. Not on the lips, but gently on the cheek. He went still in shock and she smiled at him.</p>
<p>“Not a monster.”</p>
<p>Did she really whisper those words? Or was it only their imagination? Thirteen Goblins stared at her in silence. Then the monster—the young woman who wore a monster’s form—leapt. She flew through the air and landed on the ground, not even noticing the impact. She ran on all fours towards the battlefield, and it was a monster that crashed into the Goblins, tearing at them, biting, <em>slashing</em> as they cried out in horror and shock.</p>
<p>Headscratcher stood poleaxed in place, staring at her. But then he leapt from the rooftop, ignoring Grunter’s shout. He ran after her, chasing the young woman into the heart of the battlefield. And all twelve of the Redfang warriors were hot on his heels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the story of a war. It was hot and brutal and oh so quick, and the living seemed to become the dead in the blink of an eye. But it was fought in a desolate city in the heart of winter.</p>
<p>Cold skies, snow on the ground. But hot bodies.</p>
<p>And blood. Tearing flesh. The monster swept through the ranks of Goblins besieging a barricade that had been partially knocked down. They saw her and cried out. Monsters, fearing a monster.</p>
<p>Her claws with razors that cut steel. Her teeth ripped away flesh and bone. The Goblins wearing black armor tried to cut at her, but she was a blur, and their weapons barely cut her thick skin.</p>
<p>This is the story of a young woman who let the monster in her out. She tore and bit and forgot fear and killed. She walked deeper down the path to hell, but she had a lifeline, a fragile thread that she held onto. A memory of a Goblin that hugged her, and a group of monsters with the hearts of heroes.</p>
<p>This is the story of a band of Goblins. They stood at the edge of death’s gate, staring at the young woman who danced with the reaper, fearless, fighting for her people. Fighting to live. Fighting to be Human.</p>
<p>They hesitated. Their weapons were drawn, but they dared not plunge into the conflict. Because they were afraid. Because they wanted to live. They saw the other Goblins fall back in disarray and the Humans rally as the monster attacked them. But it was not enough. There were many Goblins, and this was only a corner of the battle.</p>
<p>And the undead were everywhere. They kept coming, and they kept attacking, slowly encircling both Humans and Goblins alike. They were commanded by that awful intelligence, the gleeful, mocking skeleton dancing in their midst.</p>
<p>The Goblins stared at the skeleton, not a hundred paces away but surrounded by his minions. And they knew that if he was not stopped the Humans would die.</p>
<p>On the skeleton all things turned. And then Grunter pointed.</p>
<p>There. The Goblin commander, silver halberd on hand, pointing as he rode his Shield Spider. He’d clashed with the Gold-rank adventurer, broken the lines of Humans again and again. Without him, the Goblins would be leaderless.</p>
<p>Two leaders. Headscratcher saw both as he held his sword in one sweaty claw. If one or both fell, the Humans would be saved. She might be saved. If they fought—</p>
<p>But his feet didn’t move. Headscratcher stood where he was, ashamed. He shook. He was afraid to die. Because it would be certain death. And he was just a Goblin.</p>
<p>But the girl—she was a monster. She was a Human. She was something else. And she had seen the same thing the Goblins had. So she just ran. She leapt, and bore a Ghoul to the ground. Teeth gleamed and bit and the two creatures tore at each other.</p>
<p>Headscratcher shouted and ran forwards, sword raised as Badarrow tried to find a target among the blurring shapes. But then the Ghoul was down, a gaping hole in his throat and neck. The monster-girl ran on, at the mass of zombies shielding the skeleton.</p>
<p>And stumbled.</p>
<p>And fell.</p>
<p>Because of the arrow in her back.</p>
<p>Headscratcher screamed. He saw the shaft strike the young woman—not from the sides, but from above. A shot from high up on the barricades.</p>
<p>A Human had loosed the arrow. Perhaps he had mistaken the young woman for a Ghoul—or perhaps he had just seen what she’d looked like and shot. But the arrow had struck the young woman all the same.</p>
<p>She fell, and the zombies she’d been running towards surrounded her, biting. Tearing. Headscratcher ran into them, slashing wildly. Two zombies fell as he ran them through, shoving them aside. An arrow killed a third and then the other Redfang warriors were around him. They forced the zombies back as Headscratcher held the young woman in his arms.</p>
<p>He reached for the arrow and stopped. It was too deep, and the monster in his arms—</p>
<p>Was no monster. She was just a young woman, bleeding, torn.</p>
<p>Dying. She blinked up at the Goblin who held her, and wondered why she’d never imagined a Goblin could cry. Of course they could. It was such a simple thing, but it just proved her point.</p>
<p>They were people too.</p>
<p>She reached up and tried to brush the tear from Headscratcher’s eyes. But she was too weak. Her arm flopped back and the young woman coughed. She blinked down at the blood in astonishment.</p>
<p>Around her, the other Goblins were tearing at their packs, searching their belts. But they had no potions. Just the one they’d used for Grunter. The Hobgoblin knelt next to the girl, staring at her.</p>
<p>She smiled at them. Weakly. Dying. But then her head rose, and she stared at the Humans. They were so very fragile, so alone.</p>
<p>She pointed. The Goblins looked. The young woman touched her heart, once. It was still beating, slowly. That was all. She touched her heart and drew a line in blood down her cheek.</p>
<p>Asking a question no words could ever say.</p>
<p>This is the story of a Goblin who held a dying Human in his arms. The other warriors stood shoulder-to-shoulder, shields raised, protecting her from the few arrows that flew towards them. They snarled at the Humans on the barricades, watching as the undead pushed them further and further back.</p>
<p>The Goblin held the Human in his arms, staring at death. It was all around him, and in the burning purple eyes of the skeleton surrounded by the undead. He stared at death, but he only had eyes for the Human.</p>
<p>She spoke to him, words that he and all the Goblins heard, even amidst the fighting. The Goblin listened, head bowed, until she choked on the blood and he carried her away from the fighting, protected by his friends.</p>
<p>He laid her in a quiet place, away from the battlefield. Next to a dying fire in a place where she would be safe. Then the Goblin turned back and stared at death. Beside him, twelve other Goblins stood quietly. They looked at each other. And heard their hearts beating.</p>
<p>This is the story of a band of fools. They charged, screaming, at an army of thousands. Goblins and undead both turned to stare at them, and the Humans on the walls stopped firing as they saw the band of thirteen Goblins, fighting for something they didn’t quite understand.</p>
<p>Headscratcher was first. He ran, cutting wildly, knocking other warriors aside, darting past zombies. He didn’t care that they cut at him, ignored the arrows that flew at him, the moments when he stared death in the face. He only had eyes for the skeleton, standing among the zombies.</p>
<p>He ran, and ten Goblins followed his back, fighting as one, struggling for every step. But two Goblins did not follow them. One was Badarrow, who stood with an arrow nocked, firing into the mill of bodies. The other was Grunter.</p>
<p>Grunter. The Hobgoblin turned and ran in another direction. Away? The other Redfang warriors faltered. But the Hob turned and stared at them for one moment. Then he spoke.</p>
<p>“Go.”</p>
<p>One word. And then he plunged away through the mass of bodies. He didn’t dodge like Headscratcher. Instead, Grunter charged <em>through</em> the ranks of undead and Goblin alike. Zombies were hurled away from him, screaming Goblin warriors trampled underfoot. Grunter held his axe in his left hand and roared as he ran.</p>
<p>He had only one target. The Goblin commander astride his Shield Spider. At first, the other Goblin didn’t see Grunter among the Goblins. But soon the Goblin noticed the change in the battlefield.</p>
<p>In a sea of swirling fighting where the lines of black-armored Goblins and zombies pushed each other back and forth, Grunter cut a straight line to the Goblin commander. He couldn’t be stopped! Spears broke against his skin, swords cut but were wrenched away from their owner’s grip. Grunter ran on, bleeding from two dozen wounds, but still ran.</p>
<p><em>“You! Challenge!”</em></p>
<p>The word was a roar from Grunter’s mouth. The Goblins and Humans stopped fighting as they stared at the Hob charging at the other Goblin. The Goblin commander sneered. He raised a hand; pointed.</p>
<p>Another Hob, just as large as Grunter, ran forwards, screaming, sword in hand as he tried to slow the Redfang warrior’s advance. Grunter <em>roared</em> and swung his axe. The crushing blade crashed down even as the other Hob tried to block. The axe sheared through the sword and crushed the other Goblin’s head. Grunter wrenched the blade free and the Hob’s body fell.</p>
<p>Silence. Grunter raised his axe, gleaming with blood and gore.</p>
<p>“<em>Redfang!</em>”</p>
<p>It was a word none of the Humans knew. But among the Goblins, it caused silence. Who didn’t know of that famous tribe, of the warrior who had walked among other races?</p>
<p>Garen Redfang and his tribe of warriors. Even in the south, his name was legend. Grunter shouted again, pointing his axe at the Goblin commander.</p>
<p>Now the other Goblin hissed, his eyes flashing blood-red. He pulled his spider around and faced Grunter. The other Goblins fell away as the two ran at each other, the Hob bleeding, one arm raised with the axe, the gleaming halberd held in the other Goblin’s hand.</p>
<p><em>“Redfang!”</em></p>
<p>Grunter screamed as he brought the axe down. The blow cleaved through the air, unstoppable. The Goblin commander threw himself off of his mount’s back, and the blow smashed the giant Shield Spider into the ground. It shrieked and died.</p>
<p>But it had taken Grunter’s axe. The Hob pulled at the blade, trying to wrench it free, but too slowly. The halberd came up and then the Hob was stumbling back. He stared at his stump of a hand and heard the Goblin commander laugh. The other Goblin advanced towards him, halberd raised.</p>
<p>The Hob was still for a second. Then his other hand moved. His broken arm grabbed the axe and lifted it. Jagged yellow bone broke through Grunter’s skin, but he only grunted. Then the axe was in the air.</p>
<p>The Goblin commander raised his halberd, snarling, but too slow. The axe fell through the sky, changing the confidence to fear in the Goblin’s eyes. Grunter screamed.</p>
<p>“<em>REDFANG!</em>”</p>
<p>The blow shook the earth. It broke his arm completely. Bone and flesh splintered as his hand twisted, dangling uselessly from his arm. Grunter sat down, staring at his useless arms as the other Goblins and Humans stared at what remained of the Goblin commander, the halberd lying broken on the ground.</p>
<p>The black-armored Goblins hesitated. But then they rushed at Grunter, screaming. He stood and knocked one down with his bloody stump. He kicked another hard enough to break the Goblin’s bones. Then he was falling, pierced by countless blades.</p>
<p>Grunter lay down on the ground and stared at his own blood. With a great effort he turned onto his back and stared at the grey sky. He grunted. And smiled once before the Goblins covered him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Badarrow saw Grunter fall. He screamed and shot the Goblin who’d killed him. But there were so many. And the Goblins saw him, saw the Goblin shooting at their friends.</p>
<p>Arrows flew towards Badarrow, hundreds of them. Like rain. He dove for cover behind a fat corpse, letting it absorb the deadly arrows. So many.</p>
<p>The Goblin commander was dead, and so the Goblins were faltering. But there were still others, weren’t there? Badarrow had seem them, two [Shamans] hiding behind the others, commanding a group of undead they’d managed to gain control of.</p>
<p>They had to die. For Grunter. For using the dead. Badarrow didn’t hesitate. He selected two arrows, his very best. The ones he knew would fly furthest, straightest. He stood from behind the corpse and drew the first arrow to his chest. He loosed it.</p>
<p>The arrow flew across the battlefield. It caught the first [Shaman] as he stood behind a group of zombies, pointing and laughing. He grasped the arrow as it sprouted from his chest and fell, gasping.</p>
<p>The other [Shaman] pointed and screamed. He turned to run, and the second arrow found his ear. Badarrow grinned, and laughed as he saw the other Goblins turning. This time there was nowhere to hide.</p>
<p>So many arrows. Like rain! They struck him, one finding his chest, another his leg, the last his shoulder. Badarrow stumbled and fell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Headscratcher did not see either of his friends fall. He ran on, sword drawn, screaming. The zombies were everywhere, as were the black-armored Goblins. He cut at them.</p>
<p>Too many enemies. Then a zombie came swinging at Headscratcher from the right, five more on the left. Headscratcher saw another Goblin run past him. Rocksoup took the blows meant for him. He gasped as the zombies tore his flesh away, cut one down. Two. The third took his sword and then he was fighting with his hands against the other two. They bore him down as he stared at Headscratcher, mouthing silently as his eyes lost their light.</p>
<p>Telling him to run.</p>
<p>The ten Goblins ran on, not pausing as they left their friend behind. Leftstep was next to fall. An arrow caught him in the eye and he dropped soundlessly, still snarling.</p>
<p>Headscratcher cut the head off of a Goblin and saw the skeleton. Only forty paces ahead now. It still hadn’t seen them. He ran towards it, but a group of howling Goblins charged from the right.</p>
<p>Orangepoo ran forwards. He said not a word, just grinned like he always did. Headscratcher saw him fall as he buried a spear in one of the Goblins’ legs and trip up the rest.</p>
<p>Eight now. The Goblin warriors ran on. Now the skeleton had seen them, and it pointed. Zombies and even a Ghoul came for them. Bitefly fell on the right, cursing and cutting at the Ghoul as it bore him to the ground and tore at him.</p>
<p>Seven. There was a wall of undead in front of them. Headscratcher and the Redfang warriors charged into them, screaming. The skeleton was right in front of them. And he had a sword.</p>
<p>Cut them down. Headscratcher took the leading zombie down with a leaping thrust. He fell with the body, struggling to pull his sword free. The other Redfang warriors took down their targets too. Where was the skeleton?</p>
<p>A flash of movement. Headscratcher saw Patchhelm turn and then the skeleton blurred into focus. The Goblin fell, headless. Headscratcher <em>screamed</em> and charged the skeleton.</p>
<p>So close. The skeleton fell back, fighting four of the Redfang warriors at once. But more zombies were coming, running at them. One seized Justrust from behind and snapped his neck.</p>
<p>Five. The five cut at the skeleton, making him dodge backwards. But he was all bones and he didn’t fear mere cuts. Headscracther took a cut that laid open his leg and he saw Rabbiteater choke as a zombie bit him all way down to the bone, making him drop the sword.</p>
<p>The skeleton laughed. He turned to run, mocking the Goblins who’d come to kill him. Headscratcher swung at him as the skeleton danced backwards, nimbly evading his sword thrust.</p>
<p>So close! But not enough. The skeleton’s purple flaming eyes glittered at Headscratcher. He stepped left, dodged a thrust, flicked his sword and parried a cut. He raised his own sword as Headscratcher stumbled, seized by a zombie on his left. The skeleton laughed—</p>
<p>And Shorthilt tackled him from behind. The skeleton stumbled, turned, tried to kick the Goblin off. But Shorthilt hung on, ignoring the foot that kicked his face and broke his nose. Bugear cut sideways, forcing the skeleton to block. Then the Goblin cut at the skeleton’s sword hand, deep, lodging his sword into the skeleton’s bones. Bugear strained to keep the skeleton’s arm in place as Headscratcher ran forwards. The skeleton turned towards him, eyes furious.</p>
<p>Yes. That was right. It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t honorable. But it was the way the Goblins fought. And Headscratcher’s sword cleaved the skeleton’s spine in two. The skeleton fell in two pieces, and the Redfang warriors broke apart his body with their weapons.</p>
<p>Around them, the undead—paused. They seemed to stare at nothing, and then they moved again. Still attacking. Still trying to kill the living.</p>
<p>But no longer intelligently. No longer moving with purpose. The Redfang warriors, the five survivors, stumbled away. Headscratcher abandoned his sword to pull Rabbiteater away, giving the Goblin his shoulder.</p>
<p>They ran. Goblins were still everywhere. And the undead too. But they’d done all they could. All they could.</p>
<p>And it was enough. Because as the Goblins launched a final, desperate attack on the Humans on the barricades, the Redfang warriors looked to the gates of the city. And there they saw the adventurers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We barely made it by the looks of it.”</p>
<p>That was what the half-Elf said to the Dwarf as they stood at the rear of the Goblin army. Without their commander, the Goblins had neglected their rear. Now they rushed to overwhelm the Human defenders, stretched too thin on their crumbling fortifications.</p>
<p>“That’s true. But we did get here, and we even brought help.”</p>
<p>So said the Dwarf. He was short for a Human, naturally, but those Humans who saw him tended to think he was tall for a Dwarf. He was not, at least, not for a modern Dwarf. He was five foot two, and his muscles rippled as he raised the hammer at his side.</p>
<p>Behind him, a group of men and women, all Humans, stood with their weapons drawn. Silver-rank adventurers, over twenty of them. The half-Elf nodded.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. I’ll begin—hit them from the sides and cut towards Ylawes, would you?”</p>
<p>“Aye. Leave it to me.”</p>
<p>The Dwarf grinned. He turned his voice and roared at the Silver-rank adventurers.</p>
<p>“Follow me!”</p>
<p>He lead the host of [Warriors], [Mages], [Archers], [Rogues], and more at the side of the Goblin host, smashing through their unguarded ranks with ease. Even the Hob who turned to fight was crushed by a blow from the Dwarf’s hammer.</p>
<p>Alone, the half-Elf faced the Goblins who’d become aware of her presence. She raised the staff at her side, the blue crystal embedded in it shining. Arrows flew towards her, but the [Mage] was undeterred. She pointed at the Goblins.</p>
<p>“[Windward], [Flashfire], [Lesser Twister], [Water Arrow], [Silent Sickle], [Muddy Ground]—”</p>
<p>The litany of spells blasted from her staff, countless spells blasting Goblins off their feet, showering others with rains of arrows made from water, cutting others to bits while the arrows that had flown at the half-Elf bounced off the shield of air she’d conjured.</p>
<p>The battlefield changed again. The Silver-rank adventurers and Gold-rank Dwarf cut towards the stunned Humans. The Bronze-rank adventurer with a sword clutched at Ylawes as the man stumbled, nearly collapsing amid the walls of bodies he’d slain.</p>
<p>“Who are they sir? Reinforcements? From which city?”</p>
<p>“Yes. From all the nearby cities. And the Dwarf and half-Elf. They’re my team. The Silver Swords.”</p>
<p>Disbelieving, the Humans on the barricades stared as the Goblins below them began to rout. Their leaders lost, attacked by so many powerful adventurers, they began to flee. The undead kept fighting, but they were fragmented.</p>
<p>The exhausted man in silver armor raised his head as he heard the cheering begin. He didn’t smile. The man next to him turned to him, face shining.</p>
<p>“You saved us! You did it! <em>We </em>did it! We beat the Goblins by ourselves.”</p>
<p>“No. I don’t think it was just that.”</p>
<p>Ylawes didn’t look at the confused man. His eyes found the group of Goblins, five now, injured, fleeing the battle. The adventurer sighed, and then sat down.</p>
<p>He was so tired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was so <em>angry.</em> Toren strode away from the battlefield, knowing all was lost. He couldn’t change the outcome now. The zombies were no match for adventurers of that caliber. And he’d been so close too! Just a few more moments and he would have broken the line of Humans and been able to finish off the human in silver armor!</p>
<p>So close! But the Goblins had messed everything up!</p>
<p>Enraged, Toren slashed at the air with his sword, close to exploding with fury. How dare they. How <em>dare</em> they? They hadn’t even fought fair! They’d fought—well, like he fought!</p>
<p>It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t right. Toren stopped by the door of an abandoned building, trying to think rationally. He had to escape now. He still had his levels, his life. He could get some undead and go. Start somewhere else.</p>
<p>Doing what? The skeleton kicked at the wall and paused. Did he hear something? Cautiously, he poked his head inside the building. That was when he saw her.</p>
<p>A Human, lying on the ground. Toren hesitated. He…thought she was a Human. But didn’t he recognize her somewhere?</p>
<p>The monster girl. Yes. The flames in Toren’s eyes brightened in shock. But she was different. Was she wounded?</p>
<p>Yes. She was barely clinging to life. The skeleton walked over to her and saw the Human’s lips moving. She was whispering—something.</p>
<p>He didn’t care. The skeleton raised his sword and thrust it into the young woman’s side. He needed to kill something to feel better. He stabbed the Human with his sword, relishing the way she cried out weakly.</p>
<p>And then Toren heard the shout. He turned, but too late. The blow knocked him backwards. A Goblin had charged him from the side! The Goblin had no weapon and he struggled with Toren for his blade.</p>
<p>The skeleton tried to stab the Goblin, but he had been caught off-guard. His own sword impaled him through the rib cage. Toren staggered away, outraged, trying to drag the blade free. At last he got it out, splintering his bones in the process. He turned, sword in hand, and saw the Goblin.</p>
<p>He was holding the Human in his arms. She bled onto the ground, life oozing around his desperate claws. But she was…smiling. Smiling?</p>
<p>Toren paused.</p>
<p>He stared at the Goblin as he held the young woman in his arms, clutching at her bleeding chest, trying to hold the blood in. The skeleton saw a hand come up, and hold the Goblin’s face, and saw bloodless lips move. He saw the Goblin’s tears and felt something…odd in his chest.</p>
<p>What was this? What was he seeing? Goblin and Human? Why did that strike him as so odd? So—</p>
<p>Special? Was that the word? But the moment passed even as the skeleton watched. The Human’s hand dropped and her body relaxed. But her smile remained. And the Goblin holding her wept.</p>
<p>Toren looked away. He didn’t attack the weeping Goblin. Instead, he slowly walked into an alley as the other Goblin warriors ran to the two, crying out, making sounds of—</p>
<p>He didn’t understand. So he walked away, leaving the Goblins behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the story of a monster. This is the story of monsters. For as Ylawes stood with his companions and the celebrating Humans, he heard a cry.</p>
<p>“Goblins!”</p>
<p>He turned, reaching exhausted for a sword, but called out when he saw the approaching Goblins. They’d been poised to run, but as Ylawes strode towards them they halted.</p>
<p>Arrows and spells were aimed at them but the Goblins just looked lost. Four were holding the body between them and the last just stared up at Ylawes as he approached. He halted when he saw the young woman’s body, the face he recognized.</p>
<p>“Is she…?”</p>
<p>The Goblin nodded. He stared up at Ylawes, and the adventurer looked down at the dead girl. Her face had been ravaged by famine, and dirt and filth had created a mask over her face. But she smiled. It was a simple expression, but it shone even in death, despite all she had endured.</p>
<p>Ylawes remembered seeing her before. He remembered a monster. But what he saw was a young woman, smiling upwards. Only that.</p>
<p>Slowly, the adventurer looked at the Goblins. They stared back at him. Silent.</p>
<p>“I saw your leader kill the Goblin commander.”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“I saw your archer down the [Shamans]. Few Human [Archers] I know could do that.”</p>
<p>They just stared at him. Ylawes nodded at the Goblin in front.</p>
<p>“You slew the skeleton. Without that, we might have died before reinforcements could arrive.”</p>
<p>Slowly, the Goblins laid down the body of the Human girl on the ground. They ignored Ylawes completely. One of the Goblins with a bloody scalp slowly crossed the young woman’s arms over her chest. He hesitated, hand on hers. Then he turned away.</p>
<p>“May we never meet again.”</p>
<p>Ylawes called it at their backs. But the Goblins didn’t even acknowledge his presence. They just walked away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They found Grunter before they left. There wasn’t much of the Hob, but the Redfang warriors gathered around his corpse for a moment. Then they walked on.</p>
<p>They found Badarrow, laughing, shaking as he sat amid the arrows that had nearly killed him. Three arrows had found him, but the one meant for his chest had been horribly made. The glue had broken off and the arrowhead had barely penetrated his skin. He was still laughing about how he’d never hate another arrow when they found him.</p>
<p>Then Badarrow just bowed his head. He stood up and looked towards the body, but the other Humans were around her. The Redfang warriors slowly walked out of the city, avoiding the undead.</p>
<p>Silent.</p>
<p>This is a story of a band of Goblins, and how they left a city behind them as they walked out into the snow and darkness. They left behind their leader, over half their number and a Human girl in the city. And they left something as well. Perhaps it was a bit of their hearts.</p>
<p>This is the story of monsters. Of Goblins. But they had names.</p>
<p>Rabbiteater.</p>
<p>Bugear.</p>
<p>Numbtongue.</p>
<p>Shorthilt.</p>
<p>Badarrow.</p>
<p>Headscratcher.</p>
<p>This is their story. This is the story of how they found and left Esthelm, a city of the desperate, the dead, and those who struggled even in the darkness. This is their story. This is how it began.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the story of a skeleton. He walked away from the city whose name he hadn’t even known, beaten. Defeated not just by swords and sorcery, but by something he didn’t even have a name for.</p>
<p>He walked away, not alone physically, but alone nevertheless. Thirteen zombies and a Ghoul walked with him, silent, unthinking. They were tools, that was all. And Toren realized that a tool was not enough. Killing was not enough.</p>
<p>He was alone, purposeless again. He had failed. Toren walked on, staring at the sky. And he began to realize there were still some things he didn’t understand in this world. So he left the city where the living had reclaimed their pride. He left the Goblins, the adventurer wearing silver armor, and the monster who had become a girl behind.</p>
<p>And the dead walked with him.</p>
<p>To Liscor.</p>
<p>Back home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Pawn stared at the ranks of Soldiers under his command and realized that he’d made a mistake.</p>
<p>Somewhere.</p>
<p>He’d definitely made one a while back, when he’d brought the idea of Gods into the Hive of the Free Antinium in Liscor. That had been a mistake—or at least, telling the Soldiers had been.</p>
<p>Hadn’t it?</p>
<p>It had helped them. Pawn that thought it would save them, but it had only led to a terrible moment where they slaughtered each other to find a better place. He’d stopped that—</p>
<p>But at a terrible cost. Nearly an entire barracks’ worth of Soldiers had been injured, and hundreds had died. Still, many had been saved, and Pawn had realized what his true mission was that day. To make a Heaven for the Antinium. To make a place, a way that they would not die forgotten and alone.</p>
<p>And he had leveled up after that night, hadn’t he? He was now a Level 6 [Acolyte] with the Skill of [Humble Presence], which was surely a boon to the Hive. And Klbkch had given him command of the remaining Soldiers—</p>
<p>Perhaps that was the mistake. Revalantor Klbkch had made the mistake here, because Pawn was sure of one thing. He couldn’t lead the Soldiers.</p>
<p>He had no idea how.</p>
<p>Pawn stared down at the ranks of silent, immobile giants aligned into perfect ranks in front of him. The Soldiers stood patiently, waiting for his command. Perhaps they would wait there forever, even if he left.</p>
<p>Such thoughts were terrifying to Pawn. He was no leader. Except, in a very real sense, he was. Moreover, those under his command needed him. If nothing else, Pawn had to ensure they didn’t die of their injuries.</p>
<p>Yes, every Soldier standing at attention was technically walking—or rather, standing—wounded. Of course they didn’t show any signs of pain, despite some having cracked carapaces or missing limbs. One Soldier was missing his right eye, but he looked at Pawn as if nothing was wrong.</p>
<p>At least…they were here with him, rather than fighting as they would be normally. Even though the Soldiers here were injured, Pawn knew that they would still have normally been assigned to combat duty if it weren’t for him.</p>
<p>The most wounded Soldier could fight after only a few days of rest. Of course, they’d be missing limbs but that didn’t matter when they hurled themselves into combat. Pawn had requested the foul, stinging ooze to begin regenerating their body parts, but it was a precious commodity and so the Soldiers would be weeks or even months in regrowing their limbs.</p>
<p>And in the meantime, what did Pawn do? He stared at his Soldiers, and they stared back. He couldn’t send them to battle. He couldn’t.</p>
<p>And yet, they were his responsibility. He had to make something of them. That was what Klbkch had told him. This was a test—</p>
<p>And Pawn had no idea how to pass it. He was pretty sure on how to fail, but what could he do with the Soldiers? All he had done was give them false hope—</p>
<p>And get a lot of them killed.</p>
<p>Pawn shook his head and the Soldier seemed to straighten even more. It had been five minutes since he’d entered the mess hall and found the Soldiers waiting for him. He had to give them an order, he knew. They needed direction.</p>
<p>Hesitantly, the Worker cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“You will not be expected to fight today.”</p>
<p>The Soldiers just stared at him. Did they feel relieved? Disappointed? Confused? Pawn didn’t know. Their faces were as incomprehensible to him as all Antinium were to other species. But he knew they did have feelings.</p>
<p>“Um…just go about your daily routine. That is to say—”</p>
<p>Pawn paused. He had to be a leader. So he firmed his tone.</p>
<p>“Attend meal times as normal. However, since you are not assigned to any post, return to your barracks to rest in the meantime. I will…find something for you to do, and try to visit you and tell stories. Alright?”</p>
<p>The Soldiers didn’t respond. But they turned and immediately began filing out of the room, heading towards the barracks. Pawn watched them go, limp with relief.</p>
<p>At least they listened to him. But did they resent him for telling them about God and Heaven? Did they feel regret for their brothers that had died in the mass suicide attempt?</p>
<p>Surely they did. But Pawn couldn’t ask, because the Soldiers couldn’t speak. The Worker anxiously paced back and forth as the other Workers assigned to food serving duty watched him nervously. He was commanding Soldiers. Pawn knew they would fight the monsters that came out of the dungeon and patrol and guard—but was there anything else they did?</p>
<p>He’d never known. And now he had to ask. But who would be able to tell him?</p>
<p>Not other Workers. Klbkch perhaps—but Pawn didn’t feel comfortable asking the Revalantor questions like that. Who else might know?</p>
<p>The Queen? Pawn would have rather slapped Klbkch than ask his Queen anything. No. No, there were only two other beings in the Hive who might know.</p>
<p>Belgrade and Anand. They were [Tacticians]. They’d leveled up in that class and been assigned roles leading Soldiers. They would know.</p>
<p>Pawn found his two former chess companions after only half an hour of searching. It wasn’t as if Belgrade and Anand left signs pointing out their location in the Hive, but Pawn knew where they ate and slept. Happily, he found them doing neither and instead, playing chess in the special break room reserved for Individuals.</p>
<p>The two Workers sat at a chess table, watched by a small crowd of other Workers. They stood out. Perhaps it was the way they held themselves. With confidence and pride. Or maybe it was just that Pawn knew them so well. He sat next to them and they nodded at him, familiar and warm as the Antinium ever got.</p>
<p>“Pawn. It is good to see you here today.”</p>
<p>That came from Belgrade. He nodded precisely as he placed a knight in the attack position, threatening a pawn from Anand.</p>
<p>“Indeed. I was worried you were being punished by Klbkch.”</p>
<p>Anand ignored the attack on his pawns and instead countered Belgrade with an aggressive push from his queen on the left side, threatening a bishop. Belgrade paused. Pawn observed the playing with interest, his mind half on the game.</p>
<p>It was true that he, Belgrade, and Anand all looked the same. But they were all different from each other—vastly different in terms of personality. Belgrade was a stickler for tactics and the openings Erin had taught them. He played defensively, cautiously. Almost too much, but it was necessary against Anand’s aggressive tactics. In speech as well, they tended to reflect their traits. It was remarkable, Pawn reflected, that any Workers could be so…unique.</p>
<p>He nodded to the two as the game continued, both Workers moving their pieces quickly and only pausing for a few seconds even for the hardest decisions. They were clearly playing a lightning game, although there was no timer. Antinium had no need of such devices.</p>
<p>“I thank you for your concern. I am not being punished by Revalantor Klbkch, Anand. But I am in distress.”</p>
<p>“Indeed?”</p>
<p>“What’s the problem?”</p>
<p>“You may be aware that I have been assigned a command of Soldiers. I am unsure how to properly lead them, and what roles they may fulfill within the Hive. Thus, I have come to you.”</p>
<p>The Antinium also didn’t do much small talk. Belgrade and Anand paused for a moment. Then Belgrade tipped over his king.</p>
<p>“I cannot win this match. Another round?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The two reset the board, moving pieces with amazing synchronization. Pawn waited patiently. The game began with a classic King’s Gambit Accepted opening before Anand spoke.</p>
<p>“My experience with leading Soldiers occurs mainly in embattled tunnels and areas of the Hive in which conflict occurs. I direct their movements, reinforce them with Skills, and order retreats and designate targets as necessary.”</p>
<p>“That is my experience as well.”</p>
<p>Belgrade nodded. He placed a knight on the board delicately and stopped. Pawn had observed that Belgrade liked using knight pieces to open with.</p>
<p>“I have supervised Soldiers aiding in digging and construction at times. But Workers are more suited to those tasks. Patrolling, fighting, guarding, and scouting are the only roles I have seen them fulfill.”</p>
<p>Pawn felt his antennae droop. But he hadn’t really expected anything else.</p>
<p>“I see. And you have not ever seen them do anything for—for entertainment?”</p>
<p>Both of the other Workers paused and turned to Pawn. He knew they were surprised. If they had eyebrows, they would have been raising them.</p>
<p>“The Antinium have no entertainment.”</p>
<p>“Nor any other form of leisurely activity. This game of chess is as close as we have to it.”</p>
<p>“I know. It is just—I wish to give the Soldiers something more. You are aware of the details surrounding their injuries?”</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<p>“It was your fault, correct?”</p>
<p>Pawn nodded at Anand, acknowledging the truth.</p>
<p>“Yes. I regret my stupidity. And yet, I must now lead them. But I am no leader, no [Tactician] as you two are. You have continued to level. May I ask what level you are now?”</p>
<p>“Fifteen.”</p>
<p>Belgrade adjusted a piece on the crude board, meticulously centering it in the square before he moved it.</p>
<p>“Sixteen.”</p>
<p>Anand waited until the piece had moved to swiftly take it with a bishop. Belgrade made no audible response, but Pawn knew he was annoyed at making such a simple mistake.</p>
<p>“I am now a Level 6 [Acolyte].”</p>
<p>“Indeed? Congratulations are in order for such swift advancement.”</p>
<p>Belgrade and Anand turned. Both nodded at Pawn. He nodded back, feeling happy for their praise.</p>
<p>“It is just that I fail to see how my class can help the Soldiers. I barely know what to do with myself.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps Revalantor Klbkch sees something in you that cannot be defined by your class.”</p>
<p>Anand speculated as Belgrade attempted to regain lost ground. Pawn nodded slowly. He looked around at the other Workers.</p>
<p>They just stared at the board. He knew they were listening, but the other Workers—Individuals and Workers groomed to be Individuals—they had no spark. Not like Belgrade, Anand, Garry, and Bird. Those four Workers had what Pawn considered personality. The other Workers in the room were more like statues.</p>
<p>Soulless.</p>
<p>That was the word for it. It disturbed Pawn, although he couldn’t say why. Were the Soldiers like that? In a way, yes. Both they and the Workers kept their feelings, their true selves on the inside, if they even had a self at all. What could Pawn do for them, besides send them to die? What could he—?</p>
<p>“Pawn. Revalantor Klbkch approaches.”</p>
<p>Belgrade looked up and Pawn turned in his seat. The other Workers standing around the board scattered to make lots of room for the slim, unique Antinium as he marched quickly towards Pawn.</p>
<p>“Pawn.”</p>
<p>Just that one word made Pawn’s insides knot up. He hadn’t even known they could do that, but then, he’d seldom felt…trepidation before. But Klbkch scared him, and every time they met, Pawn couldn’t help but feel like he was doing everything wrong.</p>
<p>A feeling which was reinforced by Klbkch’s next words. The Revalantor stopped in front of him.</p>
<p>“Did you give your Soldiers orders this morning?”</p>
<p>Pawn cringed a bit. Was he not supposed to?</p>
<p>“Yes I did. Was anything—”</p>
<p>“They went back to their barracks and began to rest. They remained in the barracks when another shift came to rest, causing a delay.”</p>
<p><em>Oh no.</em> Pawn’s insides twisted further, and he saw both Belgrade and Anand pause in playing chess. How could he have forgotten? The Antinium had no personal quarters—rather, they slept and worked and ate at allotted times, in shifts. When one shift slept, another one would work, and then the sleeping shift would switch with another one.</p>
<p>That was the most efficient use of resources and it meant places like the barracks could be used at all times. Pawn had—he’d ordered his Soldiers to take up the space meant for other exhausted Soldiers ending their shift!</p>
<p>The Antinium couldn’t blush, but Pawn lowered his head and antennae. He’d already messed up. And it was such a <em>stupid</em> mistake to make too!</p>
<p>“Forgive me, Revalantor Klbkch. I did not consider that when I gave my orders to the Soldiers. I am terribly—”</p>
<p>“I have taken care of it. Your Soldiers are being stationed in safe locations on protective detail. In the future do not make the same mistake.”</p>
<p>Klbkch’s voice was flat. He turned to go. Pawn looked at his back despairingly and called out.</p>
<p>“Revalantor Klbkch.”</p>
<p>The Antinium turned. He was graceful, deadly. He walked as if the two swords by his side were meant for him, and he never looked uncertain. How Pawn envied him.</p>
<p>“What is it, Pawn?”</p>
<p>“What should I do with the Soldiers under my command? Am I to lead them into battle?”</p>
<p>“No. You have only a single Skill in the [Tactician] class and you are too valuable to risk in battle. Moreover, the Soldiers are wounded. Your command over them is experimental.”</p>
<p>“Then—what purpose will we serve?”</p>
<p>Klbkch paused. He looked Pawn straight in the eye.</p>
<p>“I do not know. Surprise me. Or pray for an idea. That is your Skill, is it not?”</p>
<p>He turned and left. Belgrade and Anand stopped their game and watched him go. After a while, the other Workers walked back and resumed watching their game. Belgrade paused.</p>
<p>“I am unsure as to what you should do, Pawn. I regret that Erin is not here to aid you.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. I dislike Revalantor Klbkch’s requirements of you, and the Revalantor himself if it comes to that. Checkmate.”</p>
<p>Anand placed his queen and created an excellent checkmate. Belgrade nodded. He looked at the other [Tactician].</p>
<p>“I am extremely upset, Anand. I demand a rematch.”</p>
<p>“I accept.”</p>
<p>Pawn left them to it. Well, he had his answer. He was supposed to do something with the Soldiers—only, even Klbkch had no idea what. Wonderful.</p>
<p>That was how, terribly depressed, Pawn found himself walking through Liscor that evening. He was still free to leave the Hive, and so he walked among the Drakes and Gnolls, feeling the cold wind on his carapace.</p>
<p>No one paid any attention to him. Normally, they might, if only to look scared and walk away from him. But today Pawn was more invisible than anything else. Oh, people noticed him, but he was now simply another person in the crowd, rather than a Worker, an Antinium.</p>
<p>It was due to his new Skill. [Humble Presence]. It made him, well, ordinary unless Pawn did something that really stood out or he was by himself. It was perfect for someone like him. Klbkch had already told him it might have useful applications in battle—but Pawn didn’t want to fight.</p>
<p>But he commanded Soldiers. But he had no idea what to do with them.</p>
<p>And he’d already caused trouble. Pawn hung his head, but his feet kept moving. In times like this, he only had one place he wanted to be.</p>
<p>The Wandering Inn. Even if Erin wasn’t there, at least Pawn could rest there in peace for a while. And he was getting hungry. Pawn had begun to hate eating in the Hive, and he had money. So Pawn walked out of the city and up to the inn.</p>
<p>It was the only place where he really felt <em>alive.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She had a guest. Lyonette rubbed her eyes a few times when she saw the figure slowly walking up the hill towards the empty inn. But it was real. Someone was coming.</p>
<p>A guest!</p>
<p>She nearly cried in relief. It had been…so long.</p>
<p>Two days this time. Two days after Lyonette had worked so hard! She’d made food and learned to cook and even cleaned the inn. But it had been two days since Pawn had left, and no one had come by.</p>
<p>Not Olesm, not Relc to ask about Erin, not even the grumpy adventurer. No one. But now she had a guest! The same guest, in fact, as last time.</p>
<p>The Antinium. Pawn. Lyonette remembered being afraid of him, of hating the Antinium. But right now she could have kissed the Worker on his mandibles. He was coming to spend money! To eat!</p>
<p>The girl rushed around the kitchen, trying to figure out what to make. Food! She couldn’t serve him the rubbery noodles she’d been making herself for breakfast, lunch and dinner, could she?</p>
<p>No, the Antinium couldn’t even handle gluten.</p>
<p>No bread or pasta, then. Lyonette froze. Could she make a soup? But when she checked, she had barely half a bucket of water left! And then the Antinium was at the door and there was no time to fetch more!</p>
<p>Screaming internally, Lyonette opened the door.</p>
<p>“Good evening!”</p>
<p>The Antinium entered, nodding politely at her.</p>
<p>“Good evening to you, Miss Lyonette. Are you open today?”</p>
<p>“Open? Of course! We’re open every day! Every night! Let me get you a chair. Would you like to sit next to the fire? I can put more wood on—”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Seemingly bemused, the Worker watched Lyonette rush about, stoking the fire, getting him a glass of water. She hovered around him anxiously, trying not to wring her hands.</p>
<p>“Would you like something else to drink? Um—we don’t have anything, though. To eat?”</p>
<p>“Water is quite acceptable, thank you. I would indeed like food tonight. What is on the menu, may I ask?”</p>
<p>Lyonette froze. What was on the menu? She didn’t even <em>have</em> a menu! Her mind went blank, but her mouth took over in this moment of crisis.</p>
<p>“W-would you like eggs and bacon?”</p>
<p>That was all she could think to make! Erin normally had all kinds of soups and meat dishes she could serve—but Lyonette didn’t know how to cook any of them!</p>
<p>Pawn seemed to think for a moment, and then nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes. I will have some, thank you.”</p>
<p>Lyonette smiled at him, dashed into the kitchen, and called herself ten kinds of stupid while she fried up a heaping plate for him. Eggs and bacon? She’d served that to him <em>last</em> time! He’d get bored of the food, surely! When she’d been living in the palace, Lyonette would have fired the [Chef] who made her the same meal twice in one week!</p>
<p>But the Antinium didn’t seem offended. Instead, he paused when Lyonette placed the big plate of eggs and bacon in front of him—nearly all of what she had left.</p>
<p>“This is quite a fine meal. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“You’re very welcome!”</p>
<p>Lyonette nearly sagged in relief. She hovered around Pawn as he picked up a fork. He paused, looked at her.</p>
<p>“Would you like to sit?”</p>
<p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>She was bothering him! Lyonette sat instantly, trying to smile and not be obtrusive as Pawn ate. The silence was…</p>
<p>After a few minutes Pawn spoke.</p>
<p>“It seems the inn is rather empty. Have you been receiving much custom, Miss Lyonette?”</p>
<p>“Me? No I—”</p>
<p>Lyonette paused. How could she tell the Antinium about crying in the inn, counting the few copper and two silver coins left? Eating the same horrible mush she cooked up every day? How could she?</p>
<p>How could she not?</p>
<p>“It’s been…hard since Erin—Miss Solstice left. No one visits.”</p>
<p>“That is troublesome. I hope my business can help.”</p>
<p>“It will! I just wish there were a lot more people like—like you!”</p>
<p>“Thank you for the compliment.”</p>
<p>“You’re…welcome.”</p>
<p>More silence. Lyonette looked at Pawn, realizing this was the first time she’d ever been so close to one of the hateful Antinium, the terrors of Rhir. He looked so…normal for some reason.</p>
<p>“Um.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“How’s it going in the Hive? With the other Antinium, I mean?”</p>
<p>The Worker seemed to pause for a few seconds.</p>
<p>“It is…going well. There are some difficulties, but the Hive is well.”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Lyonette sat with the Worker, refilling his glass, drinking some water herself. They didn’t talk much while he ate his way through the plate of greasy eggs and bacon. When he left, he paid her well. Lyonette stared at the bronze coins and smiled tremulously. Then she cried again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pawn left The Wandering Inn in good spirits. The brief respite and dinner made for a world of difference. Suddenly, he felt happy again.</p>
<p>The inn. Sitting there and talking—well, it wasn’t the same, but the Human girl had been decent company and the food had been far better than the mush in the Hive.</p>
<p>A good night. A good evening. That was what it was. Pawn walked back down the hill, staring up at the clear night sky as he did. The air was cold around him, but he enjoyed the biting chill and the crisp <em>crunching</em> sound the snow made under his feet.</p>
<p>The stars. Oh, how the stars shone. Yellow and red some of them, but green and purple others, shining bright, shining faintly, some flickering behind the occasional cloud. And the two moons were beautiful as well.</p>
<p>A sky full of wonders, a landscape full of snow and silence. Warm belly, good conversation. Pawn felt alive again. This was what he’d missed.</p>
<p>How wonderful. How…Pawn stopped in the snow, struck by a sudden realization.</p>
<p>“This is what I must show them.”</p>
<p>Yes. <em>This.</em> This night was like everything Pawn had experienced since meeting Erin, a small capsule of pure happiness. Of course, the inn was different, and it had been Erin, not Lyonette running it. But it had been the experiences of the inn which had made Pawn who he was. Klbkch desired new Individuals, but just teaching them chess wasn’t enough. Chess was only the method. It had been Erin who truly mattered.</p>
<p>And if she was gone, then it fell to Pawn to show the Soldiers the same world she had shown him. Pawn walked back to his Hive, his steps suddenly full of purpose. He needed to take his Soldiers outside. Outside of their Hive where everything was the same.</p>
<p>He would talk to Revalantor Klbkch about the issue that very night. As Pawn walked, he clicked his mandibles together, savoring the flavor of his meal. Eggs and bacon. He’d had it last time, hadn’t he? Well, Pawn didn’t mind, although perhaps next time he would ask Lyonette if she had any good cheese she could add to the meal. He really liked scrambled eggs, but he liked omelettes filled with gooey cheese even more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was never coming back. That was what Lyonette told herself again and again as she wallowed in despair in her dark, empty inn. The fire was dying down again.</p>
<p>“Idiot! You stupid idiot!”</p>
<p>Lyonette buried her head in her arms and cried. The Worker—Pawn was gone. He’d left coin, but he hadn’t said he’d return. Of course not! Who’d say that?</p>
<p>But would he come back in two more days? Or never? He hadn’t talked much—</p>
<p>Because she hadn’t been a good host! Lyonette remembered Erin being so friendly to the Antinium, but words had failed her when she’d tried to talk to him.</p>
<p>And he’d left so quickly. Had it been quick? It had felt like that to Lyonette, lonely as she was.</p>
<p>He hadn’t liked the food. That was surely it.</p>
<p>Slowly, as the last flames flickered and died in the dark inn, Lyonette raised her head. She stared at the small, circular discs of metal on the table.</p>
<p>Money. The only money she’d seen all week. Enough for a few more days of food, of life. And she still had flour and salt and…provisions enough for a few more days. But that was all.</p>
<p>Water? The stream still ran, and though the water was bitingly cold, it could be heated. With enough wood. Lyonette glanced anxiously to the dying embers, the only thing warming the cold room.</p>
<p>She had lots of firewood, actually. Erin had used Toren to gather a lot of wood from the boom bark, safely denuded of their bark of course.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t eat wood, and Lyonette was fairly certain that Pawn couldn’t either. And yet—feeding him eggs and bacon was an expensive proposition, even with how much he was willing to pay! Especially if he only came by once every few days.</p>
<p>She needed more customers. Lyonette knew that. But who would want to come here, to this empty inn without Erin Solstice? To…her.</p>
<p>No one. No one but an Antinium. Lyonette clutched at her head.</p>
<p>More guests. Drakes didn’t like Humans and Gnolls would probably try to kill her. But the Antinium—</p>
<p>They couldn’t eat bread. Or pasta. That was the huge flaw in Lyonette’s potential base of customers. How could she feed them with meat and eggs and other such expensive ingredients in the winter? A soup might work, but…any inn in the city could serve a better soup than she could, surely.</p>
<p>In her heart, Lyonette knew she was standing on a cliff. Starvation loomed over her head, dark, chittering. She had to do something. And she knew there was one thing she could do. She’d thought of it every night since Pawn had come the first time.</p>
<p>One desperate idea. That was all she had. She couldn’t make what the Antinium truly loved—and she barely had the coin to buy enough food for herself now! But there was a source of free, delicious ingredients for them, wasn’t there?</p>
<p>“The bees.”</p>
<p>Lyon whispered the word and shuddered uncontrollably. But it had been said. Now there was no going back.</p>
<p>Yes, there was one untapped source of food in this cold winter. One foodstuff that the Antinium would pay silver for.</p>
<p>The bees.</p>
<p>But they were a horror. Lyonette had seen them tear apart Toren when he angered them. She remembered the terrible, buzzing <em>cloud</em> of bees, some larger than her hand, enough to sting an entire village to death in minutes.</p>
<p>But she had no other choice. Lyonette sat in the dark in, her heart pounding. She stared at the door. Every night she’d had the same thought, and every night she’d been too afraid. For two nights now. Ever since Pawn.</p>
<p>But he’d come back. He would come back. And she was out of options.</p>
<p>Lyonette sat in the darkness. She wavered. She found a wheelbarrow and filled it with firewood and kindling. She made a torch and wavered by the door. She rushed to the outhouse to pee, and then throw up. Then she pushed the wheelbarrow out into the cold and dark, four huge jars balanced atop the wood, and Erin’s sharpest knife hung at her belt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Watch Captain Zevara, may I have a moment of your time?”</p>
<p>If it had been anyone else, Watch Captain Zevara would have told them it was late and to bother her again the next day. If it had been Relc asking whether he could take the day off, she would have burnt his face-scales off.</p>
<p>But because it was Klbkch, Zevara just sighed and resigned herself to a late night.</p>
<p>“Come in, Klbkch. Is something the matter?”</p>
<p>Senior Guardsman Klbkch entered the room, nodding politely at Zevara. He was always polite, and efficient, something she admired about him even if he was an Ant.</p>
<p>“I regret taking up your time before you go off-duty. However, I am here to make an…unusual request. And I must inform you that I do not come here in my capacity as Senior Guardsman, but rather as Prognugator of my Hive.”</p>
<p><em>That</em> made Zevara instantly sit up in her straight-backed wooden chair.</p>
<p>“Go on. Is there trouble in the Hive? An…Aberration?”</p>
<p>“Nothing so pressing.”</p>
<p>Gracefully, Klbkch took a seat in front of Zevara. She eyed him, and his new…form. It still unnerved her a bit that after nearly ten years, he could suddenly look so different. True, two arms and a slimmer body wasn’t exactly <em>that </em>different, but it was just…odd. Another reminder of who he really was, and why she had to treat him and any such conversations with care.</p>
<p>“Well, I am always willing to discuss your Hive. Is there something you need?”</p>
<p>Klbkch nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes. I would like to request that forty Soldiers be allowed access to the surface and area around Liscor.”</p>
<p>Zevara froze again. She kept none of her emotions on her face, though, and pretended to cough.</p>
<p>“That’s an…unusual request.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. I would not normally ask, but I believe the need is justified and according to our treaty, Soldiers may only leave the Hive in times of war, or—”</p>
<p>“At the request of the Watch Captain.”</p>
<p>Zevara nodded. She sat back in her chair, eyeing Klbkch cautiously.</p>
<p>“I see. And may I ask why you want to take your Soldiers out of the city? You’ve never requested something like this before, not in the six years I’ve served as Captain.”</p>
<p>“Times have changed. I believe it may be useful to my Hive to present my Soldiers with an…expanded view of the area around Liscor.”</p>
<p>That made no sense to Zevara, but few things the Antinium did made sense. She shrugged, trying to keep her tail still. She knew that Klbkch watched Drakes’ tails and could interpret their movements almost as well as a Drake.</p>
<p>“I don’t see any reason why I should refuse your request. Only—wouldn’t taking so many Soldiers out of the Hive be dangerous? Of the six hundred Soldiers permitted to your Hive, wouldn’t forty be quite a large number?”</p>
<p>“I believe we shall be able to compensate for their lack. In truth, our numbers are slightly below six hundred at the moment, but Liscor is a consummate ally, so I see no reason to worry.”</p>
<p>Klbkch’s face didn’t change. Neither did Zevara’s as she nodded at that barefaced lie.</p>
<p>“Well, reassuring as you find us, I’m afraid Liscor’s citizens might get a bit…nervous when they see Soldiers marching about. What would I tell them?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps that the Soldiers are patrolling to deal with any Goblin warbands in the area? I am cognizant that the citizens are restless due to the presence of the dungeon as well as rumors of the Goblin Lord. Seeing them patrolling might reassure the citizens of Liscor.”</p>
<p>That was a good answer, and even a helpful one for Zevara. She nodded reluctantly.</p>
<p>“Well, I see no reason to object—only, I’d hate for them to start a panic if they marched down the street. But then, I’m sure you can be discreet and find…alternate ways out of the city that won’t panic anyone.”</p>
<p><em>Through the secret tunnels the Antinium have dug.</em> That was what she meant, but both she and Klbkch knew he would never admit anything.</p>
<p>“They will not be seen within Liscor if at all possible. Soldiers can be very discreet.”</p>
<p>Zevara nearly snorted fire out her nose. She searched for another question to ask—or something else to bother Klbkch with, but she really couldn’t think of anything. Forty Soldiers killing monsters <em>would </em>be helpful, and it was hardly likely that they’d start a panic. Ten years ago when the Hive was first established, maybe. But now…</p>
<p>“Well—fine. I, Watch Captain Zevara, grant you permission and request that twenty Soldiers aid in patrolling around the city. Twenty, for now. We’ll scale up the patrols if there’s not a panic.”</p>
<p>Klbkch inclined his head towards her.</p>
<p>“I am very grateful for your time, Watch Captain.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. Just make sure they don’t scare any travelers on the main road or run into any Human adventurers. Those idiots would probably pick a fight and that’s the last thing I want to explain to one of the Human cities.”</p>
<p>“I shall instruct them to remain far away from the northern road.”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>“Well then, good night, Watch Captain.”</p>
<p>“Night, Klbkch.”</p>
<p>Zevara waited until Klbkch was gone, marching smartly down the stairs. Then she shook her head and reached for a desk drawer she seldom opened. She yanked the handle, cursed, found the small key she carried at all times, and unlocked it. A blank piece of parchment lay on it. Zevara sighed, and began to write down every detail of her encounter with Klbkch. A report. She’d have to make copies, send them to every Walled City—which of course meant a trip down to the Mage’s Guild at this time of night! Zevara groaned. She’d be getting to her bed past midnight, she knew.</p>
<p>As she began to write, Zevara muttered to herself.</p>
<p>“Take the Soldiers out? Why?”</p>
<p>But of course she never got any answers. Like all the reports she’d made on the Antinium’s movements, she only had questions. Questions…</p>
<p>Like whether or not the Antinium were really their enemies. At least, the ones in Liscor. And if they were—</p>
<p>What could be done about them? Only the scratching of her quill on parchment was Zevara’s reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lyonette was not in her bed. In fact, she was as far from it as she’d gone in the last month. She trudged through the snow, fighting to push the wheelbarrow through the snow and ice. She <em>wished</em> she still had Erin’s sled. But it was gone, with her.</p>
<p>Of course, the effort of pushing the wheelbarrow was only one of Lyonette’s concerns. The numbing cold, the intense darkness, and not least, the pants-wetting fear in her heart were high priorities too.</p>
<p>What was she doing? Every two seconds as Lyon pushed the wheelbarrow she looked around fearfully, expecting a monster to leap out at her. But she had no choice. It had to be tonight. She had to steal the honey tonight, or she’d lose all her confidence.</p>
<p>And night <em>was</em> the best time to rob the hive, or so Lyonette felt. Bees slept at night, didn’t they? Or at the very least, they’d be drowsy, and she needed every edge she could get.</p>
<p>It had been a long, uncertain journey across the plains. At first, Lyon hadn’t even known if she was going the right way. Everything looked so strange at night, under the snow. But her treacherous memory somehow managed to guide her exactly in the right direction for once.</p>
<p>To raid a bee’s nest. Even the thought made Lyonette feel weak with terror, but she had no choice. To survive, she had to do it. Steal bees right out of their nest.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe she couldn’t steal live bees, but surely she could get a few of the grubs? Lyonette remembered the one Klbkch had eaten and nearly threw up again.</p>
<p>Honey. That was the real key. Honey was precious, and she could serve it to the Antinium. They liked honey, and with a few bees—</p>
<p>She just had to raid the hive. Full of huge bees that could kill her in an instant. Lyon couldn’t get her mind off of the idea. Just one sting could—if they stung her in the eye would it reach her brain?</p>
<p>But—she had no choice. Lyonette took a painful breath of air. She was a [Princess]. She was a—</p>
<p>She was a girl. A [Barmaid]. Erin had left her inn to Lyon. Intentionally or not. And now it was up to Lyon to live or die. By herself. She no longer had any excuses. Either she died here, or she died in the cold and darkness.</p>
<p>Better here. Better with the flame of courage still in her chest. So Lyonette paused before the dark hole in the rock and took a deep breath. Sweat ran down her legs and back. She felt hot, even though the wind was blowing.</p>
<p>Bees. They were just bees, in the end.</p>
<p>And she—knew how to deal with bees.</p>
<p>It had just been a fancy. When she’d been young, her tutor had told her all kinds of things she’d willfully ignored. Lessons of algebra, governance, taxes, ruling, classes—all of this Lyonette had let pass her by without caring. But occasionally, in desperation her tutor would tell her stories to keep her interested. And Lyonette had remembered tiny bits.</p>
<p>One of those things she remembered was bees. When she’d heard how [Beekeepers] could harvest honey from the stinging creatures, she’d been incredulous. But a bit of smoke and thick clothing could do the trick better than magic could.</p>
<p>“Smoke.”</p>
<p>Lyonette stared at the firewood she’d hauled all this way. She carefully took the glass jars out and put them to one side of the cave’s entrance. Four jars. This time she’d take as much as she could. If she could.</p>
<p>Fire. The wood was wet from the snow and it was cold, but Lyonette kept striking the flint with steel. Mechanically. She made a small fire at the entrance of the cave, working despite the numbness in her arms.</p>
<p>How many times would she have given up a few months ago? Before this, she’d never—she’d never even made a fire. She would have had a servant make it, or at the very least used magic.</p>
<p>If she could have gone back in time, what would she have done differently? Everything. She’d never have come here, she wouldn’t have stolen—</p>
<p>But if she never came here, she would never have leveled, would she? And she would have been stuck—</p>
<p>The sparks flew from the flint. They landed among the wood kindling and caught. Lyonette held her breath and then desperately tried to shelter the flame.</p>
<p><em>Fire.</em> Once it grew, Lyonette fed it more wood. More and more, until the fire was hot and bright and large. Then she added the secret ingredient.</p>
<p>Flaxen sacks, grass plucked from beneath the snow—anything green that would smoke. The smell was horrible, but Lyon ignored it and kept adding her fuel.</p>
<p>Smoke, dark and noxious, billowed up from the fire. Lyonette stared at it, eyes stinging, but filled with wild elation. Fear had disappeared. Courage—she fanned the flames and the ones in her heart.</p>
<p>Soon, the cave was choked with dark smoke, and Lyon knew it would become overwhelming in a few more minutes. Perfect. She stared anxiously at the dark interior. She hadn’t seen nor heard any bees, but they were further inside. First she had to build the fire. Then—</p>
<p>Thick clothing. Lyonette had many layers wrapped around her. It might stop one or two stingers, or slow them down. She had gloves, and the knife. It could cut into the hive, hopefully. She’d cut away as much honeycomb as she could and put it in the jars. If she was lucky, she’d even get some of the grubs the Antinium seemed to like so much. Then she’d run.</p>
<p>That was the plan. And it was a good plan, brave. It lasted in Lyonette’s head, shining and full of promise until Lyonette heard the buzzing.</p>
<p>At first, it was just a gentle noise on the verge of hearing. Then it became louder, and Lyonette realized the <em>thrumming</em> was getting closer. She looked up, screamed, and ran as first tens, then hundreds of bees streamed out of the cave towards the fire.</p>
<p>They’d come for the fire. That was all Lyonette could think as she sprinted out of the cave. By the fire’s light she saw countless flickering shapes, and then heard the bees hit the fire.</p>
<p>They were extinguishing it! Embers and burning wood flew everywhere as the bees scattered the smoking campfire Lyonette had worked so hard to build. They knew! They knew about smoke and they were unafraid of fire!</p>
<p>And then they came for her. Lyonette screamed as she ran into the deep snow outside the cave. She threw herself into the snow, digging herself as far down as she could, desperately trying to cover herself. All the while, she could hear the bees’ wings beating. Like a maelstrom, like <em>thunder.</em></p>
<p>Lyonette dug, wiggling herself down, down, crying. She heard a buzzing thing hit the snow next to her head like a falling stone and cried out. But the bee hadn’t hit her! It had missed! Lyonette held as still as she could, tears running from her eyes. The bees couldn’t see her. But they knew she was there and they began stabbing into the snow.</p>
<p>The girl hid in the snow, sobbing, while the thunder buzzed all around her and she heard <em>thumps</em> as the bees landed in the snow, searching for her. Hot liquid ran from her eyes, and more ran down her pants. All Lyon could think was that she’d be dead in the next second, then the next ten seconds. Then in a minute…</p>
<p>After a while, after a long while when the thunder had ceased and all the sounds were gone, Lyonette finally sat up. She looked around and saw the snow was torn and thrown about, and extinguished remains were all that remained of the fire she’d built. And of the bees?</p>
<p>Nothing at all. They’d gone back into their hive.</p>
<p>Lyonette stared around at the shattered remains of her dreams. She stumbled, felt wetness on her lower body. She looked down. The snow had dampened her clothes, but that didn’t explain the stain around her crotch. She’d wet herself. She hadn’t done that in—at least no one was around to see.</p>
<p>In the end, Lyonette stumbled back to the inn. She left the firewood behind, the wheelbarrow, the glass jars—she didn’t have the heart to bring them back.</p>
<p>It was over. She’d had one chance, but it hadn’t even been a chance at all. These bees didn’t fear fire, and they were too smart to let the smoke fill their cave.</p>
<p>The girl stumbled back into the inn, still crying. She couldn’t do it. She’d thought—but she was not Erin.</p>
<p>And even Erin couldn’t have done that by herself. Lyonette clearly remembered the real key to stealing the bees’ honey. The horrible monster with glowing purple eyes who’d tormented her so. But for all she’d hated him, he’d been instrumental. And he wasn’t here.</p>
<p>The girl sank into a chair, wet, miserable, despairing. She buried her head in her hands, but now she was even out of tears. She was so tired. So tired—and so lonely.</p>
<p>She didn’t have the skeleton. Toren. She didn’t have Erin Solstice’s twisted, insane mind either. Right at this very moment, Lyonette wished both were back and this inn was how it used to be. She would have scrubbed the floors all by herself, hauled as many buckets of water as Erin needed, even watered the flowers and—</p>
<p><em>The flowers.</em></p>
<p>Lyon’s eyes widened with sudden memory. How could she had forgotten? She surged to her weary feet, ran to one of the windows.</p>
<p>She’d forgotten entirely. After all this time—Erin normally watered them. But could they be alive? Could she sell—</p>
<p>“<em>No!</em>”</p>
<p>She cried the word when she saw them. Flowers. Flowers yellow and bright as gold, a faerie’s payment. But wizened, wilted.</p>
<p>Dying.</p>
<p>The pots of flowers Erin had so lovingly grown were full of—Lyonette stared down at them, her heart breaking. She knew they could be made into a drink, even if she didn’t know how. The adventurer, Halrac, had paid in <em>gold</em> for it. If she had remembered, if she had cared about her duties from the start—</p>
<p>Now they were dead. Or close to it. Some still lived, and Lyonette immediately soaked the dry soil with water, but it would be long, too long before they recovered.</p>
<p>And of course, some were beyond help. Lyonette stared at one dead flower in despair. She picked it out and stared at it.</p>
<p>Another lost hope. Now her heart was well and truly broken. Lyonette stared at the fire in the inn. It was barely even embers now; the last flickers of light hidden at the center of the ash.</p>
<p>Fire had failed her. Angrily, Lyonette stalked over to the fireplace and tossed the dead flower into it. The faerie’s flower smoked and gave off an acrid smoke. Lyonette coughed, angrily waving the fumes away—</p>
<p>And woke up on her back. Lyonette blinked, stared at the dead fire, and then at the remains of the flower. She blinked—stared at the way the darkness had become lighter, at the dead fire, long extinguished, and then at the wilted flowers. Then she sat up.</p>
<p>“<em>Flowers.</em> And bees.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was just before dawn when the girl lit the second fire just inside the cave of the Ashfire Bees. This time her body was nearly completely numb and she was shaking from exhaustion. She’d brought another huge glass jar, and a handful of the most dead flowers she could gather. She prayed that was enough.</p>
<p>The kindling refused to light. The wood was so wet from its exposure to the elements—Lyon kept trying. She struck sparks until her fingers cramped, and then the fire lit.</p>
<p>She fed the fire. She added wood, feeding it, growing it frantically. How soon before the bees noticed the flame and heat? How soon before—</p>
<p>She heard the <em>thrumming</em> again, but this time she was ready. Lyonette cast the flowers into the fire and saw smoke go up. But it was only a glimpse because she was running out of the cave, diving into the snow again.</p>
<p>The bees came, a howling sound louder than anything. Lyonette waited for them to scatter the fire, but suddenly the beating noise lessened. She heard small impacts, as if something was falling to the ground and then—</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Lyon got up slowly. She stared at the cave, and then dared to approach, holding her breath. The last vestiges of smoke faded and she saw the bees.</p>
<p>There were hundreds of them. They lay on the ground in droves, legs folded, some of them with wings still extended.</p>
<p>Asleep.</p>
<p>Lyonette’s heart beat faster. She grabbed a jar. She grabbed the knife. She danced about with both, and then wondered how long the effects of the faerie flower smoke would last. Then she ran into the cave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three jars of honey and honeycomb, cut from the hive. Two jars stuffed with bees, still alive but sleeping. Lyonette sat in the snow, far away from the cave, shaking so hard she couldn’t even stand.</p>
<p>She’d seen the bees waking up as she’d scooped them up into the big glass jars. But she’d done it. She’d cut into the hive, full of grubs and sleeping bees and taken as much as she could. Then she’d filled the jars, pushed them into the wheelbarrow, and fled.</p>
<p>And now—</p>
<p>Some of the bees were moving in the glass jars. There was no air inside, but they were still alive, somehow. Lyonette stared at a huge one that wiggled its feelers and moved its legs weakly. Lyonette smiled at it, lip trembling. She held the big jar up, gloating, mocking the bees.</p>
<p>“I <em>did it!</em> You stupid bees! I did—”</p>
<p>One of the bees inside the jar tried to fan its wings and escape. It smacked into the glass. Lyonette screamed, nearly dropped the jar, caught it at the last moment, and then put it carefully back on the wheelbarrow. She shuddered as the jars full of bees vibrated. She made sure the lids were secure, and then slowly made her way back to the inn.</p>
<p>She was <em>exhausted</em>. Lyonette felt as though her muscles would tear. Her bones…seemed to ache. And yet Lyonette held her head high. She smiled, even as she ascended the hill, pushing the wheelbarrow up to the door of the inn, legs ready to give out.</p>
<p>She felt so proud of herself, she could burst. Then Lyonette pushed the door to the inn open, and found a small bundle of white fur wrapped around a table leg. Mrsha blinked as Lyonette let light shine on her face, and then looked up hopefully. Her wagging tail slowed when she saw it was just Lyonette.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>The Human girl stared at the young Gnoll. The Gnoll stared back. Lyonette sat down, a jar of honey in her hands.</p>
<p>“What are you doing…? Why are you…?”</p>
<p>Mrsha just blinked at her. Lyonette blinked back. Then, tremulously, she smiled. Mrsha edged closer, wary.</p>
<p>“You’re so <em>thin.</em>”</p>
<p>That was all Lyonette said as she sat on the inn’s floor, stroking Mrsha’s head. The Gnoll nuzzled her. She was indeed thin, and she looked—</p>
<p>Sad. Lyonette couldn’t read Gnoll’s faces, but she saw it in the way the Gnoll curled up next to her. Sad, and lonely.</p>
<p>Just like her.</p>
<p>“Would you like some honey? It’s fresh.”</p>
<p>The Gnoll’s tail wagged. And Lyonette opened the jar. And for the first time in a long, long while, as the sun rose and her weary body ached, Lyonette ate breakfast with someone else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“<em>Mrsha!</em>”</p>
<p>Selys burst through the door of the inn twenty minutes later. Lyonette looked up as she and Mrsha stared at a wriggling grub half-submerged in a bowl of white, gelatinous stuff. The Drake stared at the Gnoll, stared at Lyonette, and then at the grub.</p>
<p>“What’s happening? Mrsha?”</p>
<p>The Gnoll immediately hopped off the table and fled into the kitchen. Selys ran towards her, and stopped as Lyonette got up.</p>
<p>“Is something wrong? Miss…Selys?”</p>
<p>“Um—no, nothing’s wrong…Lyon.”</p>
<p>The Drake glanced distractedly at Lyon, not looking particularly happy to see the girl so early in the morning. She pointed at the kitchen.</p>
<p>“When did Mrsha get here? I’ve been looking for her all day—ever since I found out she’d run away!”</p>
<p>“Ran away?”</p>
<p>The Drake nodded distractedly.</p>
<p>“She’s been doing it all week. I normally find her but this time—is she okay?”</p>
<p>“I think so. She’s so thin—”</p>
<p>“She won’t <em>eat!</em> Mrsha, come out of there! Come on! I’ll feed you anything you want, just—”</p>
<p>The Drake went into the kitchen. Lyonette heard scuffling, then Mrsha bounded out and ran up the stairs. Selys went after her. A few seconds later, Lyon heard another shout and Mrsha bounded down the stairs. Selys came down after her, gasping. She had to lean against a table as Mrsha circled the chair Lyonette had been sitting at.</p>
<p>“You can’t stay here! You…give me a second…you’ve got to come back, okay? Be a good girl until Erin and Ryoka come back!”</p>
<p>But Mrsha refused. Lyonette knew the young Gnoll couldn’t speak, but she saw it in every line of her body, and especially in the way the Gnoll clung to one of the tables as Selys tried to drag her outside.</p>
<p>“Come on! Please?”</p>
<p>Mrsha <em>yowled</em>, a noise more bestial than anything else. Selys pulled and pulled…but five minutes later she sat at one of the tables as Lyonette served her eggs and toast drizzled in honey. Mrsha licked her plate—she’d eaten so much Lyon was afraid she’d throw up.</p>
<p>“I just don’t get it. She doesn’t eat anything I give her! Not even steak! Do you know how expensive that is—and where did you get all this honey?”</p>
<p>“I stole it from the bees.”</p>
<p>“The <em>bees?</em> You?”</p>
<p>Lyon just nodded. She hadn’t even had time to change her clothes. She knew she was filthy and wet and from the way Mrsha had sniffed at her, she knew she stank as well. But there was something keeping her upright, and—</p>
<p>“What’s with <em>that?</em>”</p>
<p>Selys turned a bit pale as she pointed at the grub swimming in the liquid. Mrsha sniffed at it and Selys pushed an inquisitive paw away.</p>
<p>“Don’t touch it, Mrsha. It could be…well, it’s gross.”</p>
<p>“It’s a grub. A bee larvae. And that—I think it’s jelly.”</p>
<p>“Jelly?”</p>
<p>“Royal jelly. It’s this thing in hives that bees make. You can eat it, I think.”</p>
<p>“Really? Well why not take the grub out and—boil it first, maybe?”</p>
<p>“The jelly? Or the grub? I’m trying to keep it alive.”</p>
<p>Selys paused, mid-bite, a piece of toast in her claws.</p>
<p>“Why? Are you—are you going to eat it? Do Humans…?”</p>
<p>“No. I want to feed it to the Antinium.”</p>
<p>“To the—and you stole honey from those killer bees Erin mentioned?”</p>
<p>“Not just honey.”</p>
<p>Proudly, Lyonette pointed to a corner of the room. Selys looked and nearly jumped out of her scales.</p>
<p>“<em>Gah!</em>”</p>
<p>The dead bees pressed up against the glass walls of the jars, obscenely squished together. Selys stared at them as she slowly pushed her plate away. Mrsha just sniffed at the jars, tail wagging with curiosity.</p>
<p>“Mrsha, don’t. Those are—come with me.”</p>
<p>But the Gnoll refused to move. And as she ran from Selys and the Drake futilely chased her about, Lyonette had an idea.</p>
<p>“She can stay with me.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Selys looked up at Lyon, panting. She shook her head, glancing around the empty inn and then at Lyonette.</p>
<p>“Out of the question. Erin trusted Mrsha with me—and she’s far too young. And besides…”</p>
<p>Lyonette knew what Selys was saying. Besides, how could Mrsha be entrusted to her, Lyon’s care? But she just pointed to Mrsha.</p>
<p>“She likes it here, though. She likes honey. And—there are lots of beds. I could take care of her. I could, Selys.”</p>
<p>The Drake stared at the Human and Mrsha chased her tail. But when Selys grabbed for her, Mrsha just ran behind Lyonette. The girl stared down at the Gnoll, and the Gnoll stared back up.</p>
<p>It wasn’t as if Mrsha knew Lyonette that well. They’d—well, Lyonette remembered feeding the Gnoll scraps from her plate and scratching her behind the ears, but that wasn’t what made Mrsha want to stay with her over Selys.</p>
<p>It was the inn. It was that Lyonette was here, waiting. And so was Mrsha. And no matter how much Selys argued and tried to coax the Gnoll to come with her—</p>
<p>“I’ve got to go to work. I’ve got to go but—this isn’t over, Mrsha! If I have to I’ll get Krshia!”</p>
<p>The young Gnoll hid behind a chair as Selys pointed at her. She quivered, but she still refused to budge.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to have her come up here, do you? Do you? Come on Mrsha—”</p>
<p>“I’ll take good care of her while you’re gone. I promise. I can make food—”</p>
<p>“Just don’t let her go outside, okay?”</p>
<p>Selys looked ready to tear the spines on her head off. She stalked over to the door, angry, upset. She yanked the door open and blinked at Pawn. The Antinium’s hand paused, ready to knock. But that wasn’t what made all the blood drain out of Selys’ scales. She stared up at the massive Soldier, huge, imposing, staring down at her. Her mouth opened, she gaped—</p>
<p>And then fell backwards in a faint. No one caught her. Lyonette stared at Pawn. He stared at Selys. Mrsha hid behind the jar of bees.</p>
<p>“Oops. I was going to knock.”</p>
<p>He nodded to Lyonette as she helped him drag Selys inside. The Soldiers walked in behind Pawn, so many of them! They filled the room, standing perfectly still behind their leader.</p>
<p>For a few seconds, in that moment when Selys had yanked open the door, Lyonette had wanted to scream. But that instinct had fled the moment she had seen Pawn. She looked at the Soldiers as they stood in the inn. They looked—</p>
<p>Scary. There was no other word for it. But all Antinium looked like monsters, didn’t they? Until you got to know them.</p>
<p>Pawn sat at a table, clearly wavering over the unconscious Drake. He nodded several times to Lyon, and distractedly stared at Mrsha who was creeping closer to him.</p>
<p>“I do apologize. I didn’t mean to scare anyone. I just—I had hoped you were open for business.”</p>
<p>Open for business. The words made Lyon’s eyes open wide. She stared again at the Soldiers, but this time not as a stranger seeing something unfamiliar, but as a…a [Barmaid] sizing up a potential client.</p>
<p>And there was a lot of client, and a lot of them. How much could they eat? Lyon’s eyes traveled to the jar of bees. Her heart beat faster. So she stood up.</p>
<p>And smiled. She smiled at the Antinium, even at the huge Soldiers. Mrsha stared up at one of the silent behemoths, and he stared back. He was missing a hand on one of his four arms. But he was a customer, a guest. And…oh, how would Erin say it?</p>
<p>Lyonette gestured to her empty chairs. She pointed at the bees and remembered there was a special pan for frying them. She looked at the twenty Soldiers, at Pawn, and at the Gnoll poking the unconscious Drake. She smiled, because she wasn’t alone anymore. And she asked them one simple question.</p>
<p>“Would you like something to eat?”</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Sometimes it bothered him, the way others treated his kind. Pawn knew there was history behind the stares and frightened looks. And he understood that the Antinium looked…different, even from other species. But even so, it hurt a bit.</p>
<p>And Selys knew him! She was hardly a stranger to the Antinium. Was there really that much difference between Pawn and the Soldiers?</p>
<p>Standing in the inn, Pawn turned and looked <em>up</em> at the towering mass that was the Soldier standing nearest to him.</p>
<p>…Well, yes, actually. Despite Pawn’s alien appearance, he was still just a Worker, with hands and recognizable body parts. The Soldiers on the other hand looked like they were made only to kill, because they were.</p>
<p>Their hands were formless digits that were more suited to gouging their enemies and smashing skulls into the ground. Their carapaces were reinforced, made to act like armor. And their mandibles were quite a bit bigger, so as to give them another means of attacking.</p>
<p>They were frightening. But the Human girl who smiled at Pawn and the small, white Gnoll didn’t seem nearly as scared as Selys had been.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a ton of food for you! Just wait—I’ll cook up some right now!”</p>
<p>Lyonette was practically running around, trying to show Pawn her latest acquisition as Selys sat taking deep breaths and Mrsha ran about, sniffing at Soldiers and darting away when they stared at her. It was confusion, and Pawn wasn’t helping by trying to simultaneously apologize and explain.</p>
<p>“I am very sorry Miss Selys. I did not mean to cause alarm—”</p>
<p>Selys waved a claw at Pawn as she half-drank, half-choked on her glass of water. She couldn’t take her eyes off of the Soldiers.</p>
<p>“No—no I was—it wasn’t your—why are there <em>Soldiers</em> above ground? Ancestors, don’t tell me it’s war!?”</p>
<p>The Drake looked horrified. Pawn hastened to reassure her.</p>
<p>“Nothing of the kind. The Hive has merely sent out a patrol to…patrol the landscape. We will eliminate any monsters we encounter and attempt to improve the morale of the citizenry by our vigilance.”</p>
<p>“Improve? Our morale?”</p>
<p>Pawn nodded. That was the official line Klbkch had given him and Pawn thought it was a rather good one. Seeing Selys’ fish-eyed stare made him wonder how believable the explanation was, though.</p>
<p>“I see. I see. I’m uh, well, I’m glad for you. This is a promotion, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“A promotion? Ah. Um. Yes, I believe it is.”</p>
<p>Pawn had never thought of his new job in those terms. But the idea seemed to be reassuring to Selys, so he went along with the idea. She stared at the Soldiers, still standing motionless in the inn, all waiting for Pawn’s next order.</p>
<p>“And they obey everything you do? Really?”</p>
<p>“That is their nature, sadly.”</p>
<p>Pawn wished it weren’t so. But the Soldiers really did seem to have little personality, or at least, the will to do what they wanted. Even less so than the Workers, to be honest.</p>
<p>A lot had happened since he’d visited the inn last night. After a rather…nerve-wracking conversation with Klbkch, Pawn had found his request to take Soldiers outside the Hive approved to his great surprise. He had also made a few attempts to inspire the Soldiers, to give them his perspective on life.</p>
<p>That hadn’t gone so well.</p>
<p>The first thing Pawn had given them was a chessboard. Even when he’d explained how it worked, the Soldiers had just stared at the pieces. When he’d asked one to play against him, the Soldier had begun moving the pieces, following the rules, but seemingly without any idea of how the game actually worked. Pawn had played five games and the Soldier hadn’t improved after the fifth game. In fact, he just moved the chess pieces forwards from left to right as Pawn slowly eliminated them from the board.</p>
<p>That was disheartening. But then Pawn had had the brilliant idea to give Soldiers names! Erin had done it for him. He’d sat with a Soldier—somewhat apprehensively as he knew what might occur—and given the Soldier a name.</p>
<p>Robert. But the newly named Soldier hadn’t even seemed to react to having a name. Pawn had noticed that happened when he and Klbkch had tested the Workers and some Soldiers as well. The Workers either became Aberration or Individual when given a name, but the Soldiers didn’t. They just acted like the name was, well…words.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem to matter to the Soldier that he had a name. Pawn had hoped it would spark something in him, some sense of ownership, but the Soldier had just obediently responded to the title just like he would if Pawn pointed at him and said, ‘you there’.</p>
<p>It was baffling to the Worker. How could the Soldiers not <em>care</em> about names? But then he’d realized—what use was a name if you couldn’t speak it yourself? The Soldiers had no voices, no speech. They couldn’t speak, and so what was a name for them? Just another word they would never say.</p>
<p>Pawn agonized. He’d given up in despair, realizing that he had made one smart decision. Within the Hive there was nothing to show the Soldiers. But outside—</p>
<p>Selys seemed like she was ready to go. She kept glancing towards the door, but she hadn’t moved, possibly because two Soldiers stood next to the entrance, as if they were guarding it.</p>
<p>Which they might actually be. Klbkch had told the Soldiers to protect Pawn, and Pawn had told them not to attack anyone. Which meant they only <em>looked</em> as if they were contemplating tearing Selys’ tail off and feeding it to her.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve got to be going. I’m already late and there’s so many Humans to deal with in the Guild…shame I can’t stay and chat, Pawn.”</p>
<p>Selys stood up, tail twitching anxiously as she edged towards the door. She glanced at the ground and called out sharply.</p>
<p>“Mrsha, come on! Let’s go.”</p>
<p>The little Gnoll looked up in betrayed shock—Selys made a grab for her, but Mrsha dove under a table again. Lyonette paused and turned back to the Drake, looking anxious.</p>
<p>“You said she could stay!”</p>
<p>“I did. But now Pawn and his—friends have come, I’m sure it would be safer—”</p>
<p>Selys caught Pawn’s eye and looked away guiltily. He felt sad inside, and a bit angry.</p>
<p>“We will not be staying long, Miss Shivertail. I only wished to show the Soldiers this inn before we continued patrolling.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Well…”</p>
<p>“Mrsha will be fine here. And I can feed the Soldiers as well. I have more than just bacon and eggs.”</p>
<p>“Like cheese?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Lyonette looked confused. She hurried into the kitchen and came out with something on a plate.</p>
<p>“I just made this! It’s not as good as what Erin can do but—I found more bees!”</p>
<p>Pawn had been about to decline Lyonette’s offer for a meal. He didn’t want to impose, and he didn’t want to alarm Selys by having the Soldiers eat here. But all that changed when he heard Lyonette’s words.</p>
<p>“Did you say…bees?”</p>
<p>He’d had…one bee before. One bee. And like the acid flies, it wasn’t something Pawn forgot easily. He stared avidly at the thing on the plate. Lyonette had indeed just fried up the thing that Selys recoiled from and made even the Soldiers look twice.</p>
<p>A bee, legs curled, neatly sliced down the abdomen to let the insides fry on the pan. It now lay, wings folded, staring up at Pawn, making his intestines gurgle. It was steaming, and juicy with grease and honey. Pawn’s stomach sat up and <em>begged</em> for him to bite into the exposed innards that smelled…</p>
<p>Oh, heavenly.</p>
<p>Part of Pawn immediately wanted to eat the bee at once. But he stopped his hand as he remembered.</p>
<p>“Ah. Regrettably…I would love to sample this bee. But it would not be fair to the others, I feel.”</p>
<p>He was full of regret. But to his surprise, Lyonette just smiled.</p>
<p>“I have lots more.”</p>
<p>“Lots?”</p>
<p>Pawn looked at her hopefully. The [Barmaid] nodded.</p>
<p>“Two huge jars, in fact. Enough for you and all the Soldiers. You should have this one first. You <em>are</em> their leader, aren’t you? And then when you all come back from your patrol, I’ll have enough for everyone.”</p>
<p>Pawn hesitated. A meal had been in his hazy plan for the day with the Soldiers, but bees? He had a bag of coin, but he didn’t know if it would be enough. But bees…perhaps Lyonette would open a tab? He looked at the other Soldiers and came to a swift decision influenced not at all by the delicious bee in front of him.</p>
<p>“I am afraid we number twenty one in all. Would that put too much of a strain upon your inn?”</p>
<p>He didn’t want to overburden the Human girl. Lyonette did indeed seem shocked. She swayed on her feet a bit, and gulped slowly.</p>
<p>“Twenty? I can…yes, I can do that.”</p>
<p>“Very well then. We shall patrol and be back…in two hours? Roughly that time. Is that enough?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, absolutely! And Mrsha can stay with me—”</p>
<p>The Gnoll was still evading Selys’ every attempt to get near her. Frustrated, Selys threw up her hands.</p>
<p>“Fine, <em>fine.</em> I’ve got to go! I’m so late! Just keep an eye on her, okay Lyon?”</p>
<p>“I will. And I’ll have everything ready for you in two hours, Pawn.”</p>
<p>The Antinium nodded, and, after Selys had left, led his Soldiers back outside. There they joined the other Soldiers who’d been waiting like statues outside and nearly given Selys a heart attack.</p>
<p>“As you may have heard, we will be eating a lunch at this location later today.”</p>
<p>Pawn addressed the Soldiers who stood to attention, listening to his every word. He’d already gotten over a lot of the awkwardness of commanding them. They were the twenty least-injured Soldiers assigned to him, and they had obeyed his every order flawlessly since leaving the city.</p>
<p>He wondered if they were getting anything out of this experience. Well, they’d only left the secret tunnel just outside of Liscor and walked here so far. And this was a good place to start.</p>
<p>Pawn gestured awkwardly to the inn. The Soldiers stared at a wooden wall and then back at him, expressionless.</p>
<p>“That was an inn. People go there to sleep and eat delicious food.”</p>
<p>They stared at him. Pawn coughed, and nodded a few times. He stared around. What else could he show them? It was the middle of winter, and there wasn’t a lot of…</p>
<p>He pointed at the ground. The Soldiers stared down at the snow, ankle-deep around their thick legs.</p>
<p>“This is…snow. There’s grass underneath. Grass is green and can’t be eaten, but it is worth looking at.”</p>
<p>They stared at the snow. One Soldier lifted a foot experimentally and crushed some snow underfoot. Pawn considered this a victory. He coughed again.</p>
<p>“I ah, will find a place for us to patrol to. We can walk and I can tell you…stories, I suppose. Show you the landscape.”</p>
<p>If only there were <em>flowers</em> and animals! Pawn agonized, but he was determined to make this outing a success. Somehow. The Soldiers might not be too amazed just yet, but he’d show them. And if he failed, which was likely, there were always the bees. The delicious, crunchy…</p>
<p>Pawn licked honey off his fingers. Well, he <em>was</em> the leader after all, and Lyonette had already cooked it. Besides, the bee had been small. Barely a mouthful. A delicious…savory…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Soldiers stared at Pawn. He was thinking, and so they waited for him to give the next order. This is how they thought. Pawn was their commander. He had eaten something that was not mush, something that smelled <em>good.</em> That…intrigued them. Would they eat it later?</p>
<p>All of the Soldiers stood at attention, but they were not fully <em>at</em> attention mentally. In fact, all of the Soldiers were highly distracted by the scenery around them.</p>
<p>What was this strange place they had come to? None of them had ever left the Hive, ever gone to that mysterious place known as Above. Even when some Soldiers had been called by Klbkch to fight above, they had not been chosen.</p>
<p>But today, they had gone Above. They had emerged into the bright, <em>bright</em> world and found unending wonders waiting for them. They had seen…snow? Is that what Pawn had called it? And a Gnoll? Was that the fuzzy creature that stared up at them with huge eyes? And the fleshy thing? A Lyon?</p>
<p>While Pawn was thinking, some of the Soldiers looked past him. Up. Into the sky. They had never seen the sky before. Their sky was dirt and stone. But this sky—</p>
<p>Vast. Limitless. And so full of color. Some of the Soldiers felt weak at the knees, and not because something had bit their kneecaps off. They looked up and saw the sky.</p>
<p>The sky was blue. Deep blue, and the air was so cold. The Soldiers felt as though they would die if they stayed out here too long, and that was a fascinating thought. The Hive was never this cold. Chilly in some places, in deep tunnels, yes, but never freezing. And the sky.</p>
<p>It was so blue. It was a color they’d never seen, not once in their time in the Hive. Just the sight of it made each Soldier rejoice inside, and realize that there was something to rejoice. Just like when they’d heard the stories of a better place, when the Worker had come to them and offered them—</p>
<p>“Ah, we’ll go this way. It’s not so crowded.”</p>
<p>The Soldiers broke off from their dream-like thoughts and snapped fully back into the world. They had orders! Pawn pointed, down the hill towards a flat area of snow.</p>
<p>“We’ll look at trees. Trees are like grass, but harder. It turns into wood, like what this inn is made of.”</p>
<p>As one, the Soldiers stared back at the inn. That was from trees? They’d seen wood, but it grew out of the ground? Really?</p>
<p>“This way! I have so much to show you.”</p>
<p>Excitedly, Pawn set off down the hill. As one, the Soldiers followed him, some flanking the Worker to provide a shield with their bodies. They were going to see trees! What were trees?</p>
<p>Pawn was doing this to show them something. That was what he had said, and the Soldiers felt he had already delivered far past their expectations. They had only imagined another tunnel in the Hive, perhaps one bigger than the rest or with some unique feature like an interesting curve or mineral deposit in the walls. But this?</p>
<p>Trees. The Soldiers marched through the snow, cold and melting. They were going to see something new. Something they couldn’t even imagine. And they were grateful, of course. But the Soldiers could have happily stared at the sky and watched the clouds roll across that infinite void…</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p>This was Above. This was a place their fellow Soldiers had never seen, a place where other Soldiers had fought and died long ago, in older wars. The Soldiers drank in every detail, from the face of the Drake to the furry thing called a ‘Mrsha’ that stared at them and made them feel so odd.</p>
<p>They knew they would remember this day for the rest of their lives. And they were all the more determined. They would fight with all they had, against whatever grave foe lurked Above. It would be a fair price for this moment.</p>
<p>For, surely there was a foe in the snow. The Soldiers watched the ground warily, not trusting the pretty ground any more than they trusted Pawn’s assurances that they wouldn’t actually do any fighting today. Normally they fought in three dimensions, where attacks could come from the ground, overhead—monsters could come bursting out of the walls or even shatter your stone footing to drag you into dark pits. What strange new enemies would come in a place where there was no dirt ceiling above you?</p>
<p>Their answer came when something white and soft flew out of the sky and smacked Pawn in the head. He stumbled and yelped as the Soldiers turned as one.</p>
<p><em>Sneak attack! </em>From where? At first they didn’t see, but then they spotted it. Some creature—many creatures of snow and wood! They stood, lumpy humanoids throwing snow mixed with ice and bits of rock at the Antinium.</p>
<p>Pawn wiped away some snow from his head.</p>
<p>“Oh. Snow Golems. That scared me. You see, these are creatures of ice and magic. They’re not dangerous unless you are a child, not unless they grow to be truly huge. I believe we can simply av—”</p>
<p>The Soldiers <em>charged</em> as one. They thundered across the snowy plains at the Snow Golems, eight of them, who all paused as they saw a black mass of behemoths running at them full tilt.</p>
<p>The icy brains of the Snow Golems weren’t capable of much thought, but even such creatures could sense trouble. The Snow Golems turned and began to flee, some plodding along with clumsy legs, others rolling across the snow. They were too slow.</p>
<p>The first Soldier caught up to a classic Snow Golem, three orbs of ice placed on top of each other and twig-like arms. It even had a carrot for a nose. The Golem turned and slashed at the Antinium. Its wooden arms broke on the Antinium’s carapace. Then a shovel-like fist smashed through its face and it was gone.</p>
<p>Another Soldier leapt into the air, thrown by two of his companions. He <em>smashed</em> into another Golem, crushing the huge head with a knee. The Golem fell and the Soldier began to dig into its collapsing body, snow flying everywhere.</p>
<p>Realizing escape was impossible, the other Golems turned and fought. Or rather, they turned and had about a second to regret throwing snow before the tide of Soldiers rolled over them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Standing in a state of shock about twenty meters away, Pawn watched the carnage unfold as his Soldiers tore the relatively harmless Snow Golems to pieces. They ripped the wooden arms off of Golems, pierced their snowy bodies with their fists, kicked Golems to bits and them trampled the remains.</p>
<p>It took less than a minute before the ground was covered with the…relatively ungory remains of the Snow Golems. Honestly, it just looked like a messed up patch of snow. The Soldiers marched back towards Pawn and he stared at them. They were covered in melted snow, and one of the Soldiers had a carrot in his hand. He offered it to Pawn.</p>
<p>“Oh. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Pawn took it, and then stared at the carrot. Why had the Soldier grabbed it? Then he remembered. Standard practice for the Antinium was to collect the remains of whatever they killed and turn it into food, much as the Goblins did. This being the only remotely edible thing the Snow Golems left behind…</p>
<p>“You can eat this, you know.”</p>
<p>The Soldier stared at Pawn blankly. The Worker handed it to him.</p>
<p>“Go on. It’s a bit cold, but it’s edible.”</p>
<p>And probably, far tastier than it would be when mushed with a thousand other bits of food for the gruel the Soldiers normally ate. Encouragingly, the Worker mimed eating it. The Soldier held the carrot up, seemed to hesitate, and then crunched into the carrot.</p>
<p>All of the Soldiers and Pawn watched as the expressionless Soldier ate the carrot. It took three bites, and when it was done, the Soldier stood at attention.</p>
<p>Pawn sighed. Well, what had he expected? He shook his head.</p>
<p>“I suppose…good job, everyone. Those Snow Golems…won’t be throwing snow at anyone else. Let us move on.”</p>
<p>The Soldiers followed him as the Worker marched on. Pawn stared at the bit of trampled ground as he passed and shook his head.</p>
<p>“Poor Snow Golems.”</p>
<p>For all they’d hit him with a snowball—filled with pebbles no less—he felt they hadn’t exactly deserved <em>that.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>—-</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A carrot! What had it tasted like? Was it really edible, just like that? The other Soldiers were agog, but they couldn’t interview their companion as they marched. And even if they could—they didn’t talk or use sign language.</p>
<p>Rather, Soldiers could vaguely sense what the others were feeling or thinking. It was more of a skill used for coordination in battle, but what they sensed now was that the Soldier who ate the carrot felt extremely…good.</p>
<p>Good, yes. It was a crunchy food, and it didn’t <em>mush</em> and taste…like what they normally ate tasted like. And it was cold!</p>
<p>The Soldiers marched on, listening to Pawn’s explanations of how Snow Golems came to life. It made little sense to them, mainly because none of them wore or needed clothing, but they enjoyed listening nonetheless.</p>
<p>Then they found the Shield Spiders.</p>
<p>It was a collapsed pit, one of the many lairs the Shield Spiders made to lure in prey. But the snowfall had been heavy, and the fake ground had collapsed, spilling inwards to reveal the nest. Already Shield Spiders were laboring to remove snow and repair their trap, but the Antinium had come before they could finish their work.</p>
<p>Pawn stared down into the hole as the Soldiers tensed as one. Shield Spiders! They knew this enemy. They looked at Pawn for his orders, since they were not under direct attack. The Worker hesitated.</p>
<p>“Oh dear. This is a menace. And Klbkch did tell us to remove minor threats…ah, I believe we should attack?”</p>
<p>The Soldiers hesitated. That sounded like an order, but it wasn’t phrased like one. And the Shield Spiders had noticed the Antinium. Several large ones in the pit turned to face the Soldiers and began to crawl up the dirt sides, fangs bared for the attack.</p>
<p>“Ah. They have noticed us. I suppose we must do this then.”</p>
<p>Pawn sighed. He sounded almost regretful. The Soldiers were vibrating with nerves and readiness for battle.</p>
<p>“Be careful. Do not take risks. And um—very well, now is probably the time. Attack?”</p>
<p>The Soldiers <em>exploded</em> into motion, charging forwards around Pawn at the surprised spiders. They leapt into the pit, smashing down on the many Shield Spiders, big and small.</p>
<p>One Soldier landed and crushed a Shield Spider with his feet. Then he turned and grabbed another one. It bit at his arm, tearing into his thick carapace, but he ignored the spider’s fangs. The Soldier smashed the spider repeatedly into the ground. The Shield Spider had an exoskeleton like armor, but after the ninth crushing blow the bulbous abdomen split and goo poured forth.</p>
<p>The Soldier let the Shield Spider drop and turned. By this point, the other Shield Spiders were long dead, trampled, kicked, and punched into shapeless forms by the Antinium Soldiers. Not even the smallest baby or egg was left alive. When Pawn peered into the pit he only had a few words to say.</p>
<p>“Oh my. That is quite…efficient.”</p>
<p>Then he saw the wounded Soldier.</p>
<p>“You’re hurt! Come here, quickly—I’ll try to stop the bleeding with…something!”</p>
<p>The injured Soldier moved back, scrambling out of the pit despite his lacerated arm. The other Soldiers merely braced themselves, prepared for a second attack. They waited. They waited for the ground to erupt, for a hundred more Shield Spiders to come digging themselves out of the soil. They waited for an ambush—perhaps from the side, or other spider variants to come at them in a horde as so often happened in the tunnels of their Hive. They waited and waited, until they realized there was nothing to wait for.</p>
<p>Slowly, confused, the Soldiers lowered their arms. Pawn was busy fussing over the Soldier’s arm, pressing at the seeping green liquid, not bothering to look around for other threats. Surely he wouldn’t do that if there were no more threats? The Soldiers stared at him, and then around in confusion.</p>
<p>Was that it? Was that…it?</p>
<p>It was far too easy. Shield Spiders normally came in nests of at least fifty, or as many as three hundred! And where were the other breeds? These spiders had been tiny, barely hatchlings! Was this really all there was to fight?</p>
<p>Eventually, the Soldiers scrambled out of the pit and formed a protective circle around Pawn as he fussed over the wounded Soldier’s arm. He seemed so concerned over the Soldier’s injury, inspecting the broken chitin and green ichor seeping out of the wound. The Soldier in question didn’t react to the damage and the other Soldiers knew he was fully capable of fighting on. The cuts weren’t that deep, and as for the wound itself, what of it? It was just pain.</p>
<p>In the end, the bleeding did stop, and the Soldiers expected Pawn to lead them on. But he didn’t.</p>
<p>“I think we should go back. None of you were meant to be injured. At the very least, you should rest.”</p>
<p>What? Did he really think that would slow the Soldier down? But yes, Pawn led the incredulous Soldiers back towards the inn. There he talked with the Human named Lyon or perhaps Lyonette and after a while, had the Soldier rest in the inn, sitting by the fire with a bandaged arm.</p>
<p>That done, Pawn led the Soldiers on again. They marched through the snow, staring at trees, crowding around to see the flower he unearthed. And they were ready for fighting and did fight now and then. But it wasn’t like the Hive. It wasn’t like the brutal, deadly warfare underground. None of them had died, which would never have happened if they’d been stationed on the front lines in the Hive. And they hadn’t even been hurt—well, not <em>actually </em>hurt.</p>
<p>This was so easy. This was so…enjoyable. The sky was blue, and the snow blew at them, melting and wonderful. They looked and saw color and listened to stories.</p>
<p>And they began to feel something else. A word they had no name for. All they knew was that it was mysterious.</p>
<p>And good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Soldier sat in the inn, watching Lyon work. She was a Human, an enemy at times but not now. She was rushing about, gingerly taking bees out of the large jar and bringing them into the kitchen where the wonderful smells were coming from. The Soldier longed to know what was inside, but he was trained far too well to actually stand up.</p>
<p>He’d been told to sit and rest here. In this chair. By the warm fire which was also so fascinating. Pawn had said that, and the Soldier would not move. No matter how distracting the small Gnoll was.</p>
<p>She had white fur. White fur. Fur. All of these things were new to the Soldier, and he couldn’t help but watch the way her nose wriggled as she sniffed at him. She was curious, as curious of him as he was of her. She’d dart forwards, snuffle at him, and then flee when he looked at her. When he wasn’t looking she’d sneak up again, and then flee when his head turned.</p>
<p>The Soldier was very conflicted about this. Pawn hadn’t said <em>not</em> to look at her, but was the Soldier making a mistake by interacting with the Gnoll? Perhaps he should just stare at the fire. It was amazing too. It flickered, full of bright colors and ever moving flames. He’d never seen anything like it. The sight hypnotized the Soldier, made him long to touch the flames despite the heat. He’d never dreamed such a thing could be possible. He knew fire of course, but this—this was gentle, magical. Hypnotizing—</p>
<p>Something <em>poked</em> the Soldier in the side. He whirled, fists clenched, and Mrsha bolted, her fur standing on end. It was just the Gnoll.</p>
<p>“<em>Mrsha!</em>”</p>
<p>The Lyon-Human came by, scolding the Gnoll who fled from her as well. The Soldier watched as she chased Mrsha about, the smaller Gnoll nimbly dashing beneath tables and chairs to get away.</p>
<p>“Don’t do that, understand? Don’t bother our guests!”</p>
<p>Mrsha made a whimpering sound that did something to the Soldier’s chest. Lyonette sighed.</p>
<p>“I need to find something for you to play with, don’t I? Um…”</p>
<p>She wandered away, but stopped by the Soldier. She gave him a wide smile that looked…nervous? Was that the word?</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry about that.”</p>
<p>The Soldier stared at Lyon blankly until she backed away. Was she apologizing? To him? Why?</p>
<p>The Soldier had heard of apologies. They’d been explained to him and the others by Pawn, along with countless other ideas when he’d told them stories of God and other things. But he’d never dreamed of hearing an apology while he lived. And to <em>him</em>, no less.</p>
<p>The Soldier was very glad the Shield Spider had bit his arm.</p>
<p>As Lyonette searched for things to amuse the small Mrsha-Gnoll, the white creature scooted across the floor on its butt, tail wagging as it stared up at the Soldier. He stared at her. She stared back. She had big, round eyes that were brown with gold strata mixed among the depths. There was something in her eyes, the Soldier felt. Something beyond mere flesh.</p>
<p>The Gnoll and Soldier stared at each other in silence, the Gnoll occasionally blinking. The Soldier stared into her eyes. Something. Something was in there. Something else. Something he’d never seen before.</p>
<p>Eventually the Gnoll got bored and scooted away to see what Lyon was doing. The Soldier went back to watching the fire. He felt enlightened.</p>
<p>Protect, Pawn had told him. Protect. The Soldier understood protecting, or at least, he’d thought he did.</p>
<p>He fought to protect the Hive. And his Queen. And Revalantor Klbkch and the Prognugator, if there was one. But he also knew that Liscor was part of the things he was ordered to protect, even if it was at the bottom of the list and a secondary objective in most cases.</p>
<p>But protecting the city meant protecting the people. And the Mrsha-Gnoll was part of people. So he would protect her. The Soldier thought about her eyes and the way her tail thumped on the floorboards and knew that this order was right. And he wanted to obey this order.</p>
<p>It was good. It was all good. And then the Lyon-Human came into the common room with buckets. She stared at them, scratching her head.</p>
<p>“I think…is this something Erin bought?”</p>
<p>She sounded uncertain. The Mrsha-Gnoll stared at the cans and poked one with a claw. Lyon-Human found something to lever open a lid, and then the Soldier in his chair saw what was in the cans.</p>
<p>Color.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Rock Crab was a giant of the plains. An apex-predator, despite the fact that Goblins occasionally made snacks of its kind. But it was nevertheless one of the more dangerous monsters around—at least, during off-seasons like Winter.</p>
<p>For who could match the fearsome Rock Crab, hiding until the moment it exploded from the snow with huge claws that could tear apart almost anything? Corusdeer were easy victims of Rock Crabs, as were sheep and goats and other animals.</p>
<p>True, the Rock Crab had learned to avoid disturbing the larger nests of Shield Spiders, and during the spring it usually hid from the predators that liked to eat it as a snack. And the crab would certainly have been easy prey for any Crelers if they came to this area. But sheep? Sheep were dead the instant the crab saw them.</p>
<p>Now the crab saw something strange as it hid, a snow-covered boulder conspicuously sitting in the middle of the snowy plains. It saw the Antinium, black, huge bodies, many of them, marching across the ground.</p>
<p>The Rock Crab considered this prey. It didn’t look too…appetizing, but looks could be deceiving. And the crab was hungry—it hadn’t found anything worth eating in a while. So it slowly raised off the ground and scuttled closer to the Antinium.</p>
<p>They spotted the crab almost instantly. But that was fine—the crab could run. It increased its speed, and then noticed something odd.</p>
<p>The bug-giants were getting closer. Rather quickly. In fact, they were running at the Rock Crab like a huge wall. Black bodies streamed towards the Rock Crab, and it was reminded of the horrible green Goblins, except that these Soldiers were a lot bigger.</p>
<p>A <em>lot</em> bigger.</p>
<p>The Rock Crab reversed direction. It turned and ran as the Soldiers charged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Corusdeer herd was mighty. Rock Crabs were no threat when there were so many deer together. They could incinerate even the most dangerous enemy in seconds. But when they saw the wall of charging black bodies they ran. They outnumbered the strange things, true, but the Antinium smelled of blood and murder. And they looked like a wall, a wall of chitin and muscle and death.</p>
<p>The Corusdeer didn’t fight walls. They ran too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Shield Spiders rejoiced when their pit trap collapsed inwards, drawing in food for the winter. Their rejoicing turned into dismay when they saw the huge black shapes of the Antinium and saw more leaping into the pit. But there was nowhere to run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dino-birds flew up in a huge flurry of wings when the Soldiers got too near the nest. Pawn wasn’t surprised by this point; the Antinium were hardly stealthy, and all the other monsters and animals he’d encountered on his eventful patrol with the Soldiers ran the instant the Soldiers attacked. They could tell when bad news ran at them with several hundred pounds of killing force.</p>
<p>“Those are dino-birds, I believe. Erin calls them that although I suspect they have a different name.”</p>
<p>The Soldier stared up silently at the fleeing birds, and then down into the nest. Pawn saw the eggs at the same time the Soldiers did. He marveled at the size of the eggs, and their speckled patterns, nearly invisible in the nest made in the snow. The Soldier nearest them raised a foot to smash the egg to pieces.</p>
<p>“Don’t kill it!”</p>
<p>Pawn intervened as the Soldier prepared to destroy the nest. One of the Antinium’s other doctrines was to completely obliterate any species they found underground, an essential tactic when it came to dealing with dangers like Crelers.</p>
<p>But these eggs—Pawn tried to explain to the confused Soldier.</p>
<p>“They’re just eggs. I mean, the birds are…they’re sometimes a threat I suppose, but they’re not too dangerous and if they all died, wouldn’t that be bad?”</p>
<p>The other Soldiers just stared at him. Pawn sighed.</p>
<p>“They’re innocent. Don’t smash the eggs.”</p>
<p>The Soldiers stared at the eggs, but obediently left them unsmashed. Pawn led them away, and as they began marching away, they saw the dino-birds returning to the nest, calling out anxiously. The Soldier watched the birds for a second before returning their gazes to scanning the landscape for threats.</p>
<p>Pawn trudged ahead of them, tired, somewhat dispirited. It had been a long two-and-a-half hours. In that time, he’d somehow managed to have his Soldiers crush two Shield Spider nests and chase off both a Corusdeer herd and a Rock Crab. Which was all good of course, and part of their patrolling duties. It was just—</p>
<p>Was this really teaching the Soldiers anything? All it felt like Pawn was doing was having them fight different enemies.</p>
<p>But he brightened up when they got close to The Wandering Inn. The patrol might not have shown the Soldiers anything special, but this—</p>
<p>The instant he opened the door Lyonette ran towards him, wringing her hands.</p>
<p>“I am <em>so sorry.</em> Mrsha was playing with some paint—I don’t know how she found the paint cans—and then she got some on…”</p>
<p>Fearfully, Lyonette pointed. Pawn looked and saw—</p>
<p>Color. It was splashed into the dark brown carapace of the Soldier, paw prints in white. They covered his front, his back, even his head. They stood out against his dull monochrome body and made him—</p>
<p>“I tried to stop her! But Mrsha wouldn’t listen and she’s <em>very sorry</em>, aren’t you, Mrsha?”</p>
<p>Pawn glanced distractedly at the small Gnoll who had even whiter paws and was hiding behind a table. There were pawprints on the floor as well, he noticed. Quite a few of them.</p>
<p>“Will the paint wash off?”</p>
<p>“I don’t—I think it’s really hard. This is the same stuff Erin used for the sign and I’ve been scrubbing but you need oil and a lot of work and I didn’t want to bother the Soldier so—”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Pawn just stared at the Soldier marked by the paint, along with the other nineteen Soldiers standing in the inn. Lyonette was apologizing again, but Pawn took no notice of her.</p>
<p>The paw prints. They stood out. The Soldier was marked by them. No longer could he be—well, just a Soldier. Before he had only been noticeable because of his wounded arm, but that would have healed soon. Now…</p>
<p>Paint that couldn’t be erased. Something to mark him, something that needed no words to make itself apparent. Why, it was almost like a name. In fact, it was better than a name, especially for a Soldier…</p>
<p>Lyon backed away from Pawn, eyes wide. He realized he was quivering with emotion and tried to modulate his shaking tone.</p>
<p>“I am not…not angry. Actually, I am grateful. Do you have more paint?”</p>
<p>“Me? Um, yes. It’s Erin’s actually. She bought a lot of paint, and Mrsha got into it like I said. I can give you a washcloth and water if you need—”</p>
<p>“I would like to buy your paint. All of it.”</p>
<p>“All of it?”</p>
<p>Lyonette seemed stunned. Pawn reached for his belt pouch and pulled out a fistful of coins. He put it on the table and she gaped at him.</p>
<p>“I would also like to postpone lunch for a half an hour. And if Miss Mrsha would like to help…we are going to do some painting.”</p>
<p>The Human girl stared at Pawn. Then she stared at the silent, faceless, identical Soldiers, and at the one who stood out. The one who had an identity. Her eyes widened. Then she looked at Pawn and smiled. He was already smiling, in his own way.</p>
<p>“Can I help?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paint. It was such a simple thing. Color, given form, something that could be added to almost every surface. It was just paint.</p>
<p>Just paint. Something the Antinium had no use for. Except that, as it turned out, it was the one thing the Antinium, the Soldiers, needed above all else.</p>
<p>Color. Identity. What could you give someone without a voice? A name? What good was a name if they couldn’t speak it?</p>
<p>But paint needed no words. All it needed was a brush, a paw, a hand. And it turned identical, faceless Soldiers into people.</p>
<p>They sat in the chairs around the table, eating the bees Lyonette had cooked for them. Two bees per Soldier, not nearly enough in truth for them to eat, but augmented by bowls of soup thick with butter and fat and insect parts and some actual meat. The Human girl and even the Gnoll had pronounced the soup practically undrinkable and indeed, only Mrsha had even tried it, but the Soldiers thought the soup was the greatest thing they had ever had in their lives.</p>
<p>Nearly as great as having an identity. Even as they ate, the Soldiers couldn’t help glancing at each other around the room. They had an identity now, an identity they had created themselves.</p>
<p>From paint.</p>
<p>It was on their bodies. Dabs of paint, splashes, some Soldiers nearly covered in the stuff, others with only a dab or two. But it was enough.</p>
<p>A Soldier with a handprint in blue on his chest sat across from the Soldier with white pawprints all over his body. They were two separate Soldiers who could not be mixed up with each other. They knew that. And they were happy.</p>
<p>Happy. Happy was a word they knew now, a word they had <em>experienced</em>. Happy was having paint on their bodies, making them people. Happy was seeing the small Gnoll scamper about, and nodding at the Human as she buzzed around the room, serving bees and filling glasses with water. Happiness was a warm fire, and a bee on their plates, gleaming with honey.</p>
<p>What food. What delicious food. The Soldiers had no words, no frame of reference to even understand what they were eating. They’d always eaten the same mush, the only difference and interesting change being how rotten the ingredients were, or whether some parts hadn’t been stomped and churned into complete paste. That was what they knew. But the bee?</p>
<p>Each Soldier ate slowly, gently tearing pieces off of their bee, trying to make each crunch of their mandibles last a lifetime. They didn’t speak. Of course they didn’t speak. But they thought it, and knew the others thought it too as they sat in the warm inn while the Gnoll scurried around and Pawn talked with the Human.</p>
<p>This was surely Heaven.</p>
<p>And when they left the inn, the twenty Soldiers, covered in color, they wanted to go back. And Pawn promised them they would, later, but the other Soldiers had to have a turn first. And the Soldiers knew this was true. The others, their brothers, had to know of this. They returned to the Hive, marching with their backs straighter than they’d even thought possible, heads held high.</p>
<p>And when they came back into the Hive? They changed it as well. The Soldiers marched down the tunnel behind Pawn, walking down the empty tunnel and into the main thoroughfare of the Hive where all the traffic flowed. When the twenty Soldiers first emerged into the tunnel, something happened that hadn’t occurred in all of the Hive’s history.</p>
<p>The Workers, scuttling to their destinations, the Soldiers, marching to the next battle, all of them—when they saw the Soldiers, covered in color—stopped.</p>
<p>They all stopped. For one brief second, Workers and Soldiers both stopped. Their heads turned and they stared at the twenty Soldiers, painted in hues that did not exist in the Hive. Then the Workers turned and began to move in sync once more, and the Soldiers double-timed it to their next battle. But all had seen, and all remembered. And when the Soldiers got back to the barracks…</p>
<p>Red shoulder guards, crimson like Human blood but unpainted everywhere else. That was one Soldier who sat surrounded by his fellows. Another Soldier had white antennae and slashes in the same color running down his body. One more sat with a circle drawn in every color of paint Lyon had found, a multicolored ring on his chest.</p>
<p>They were not Soldiers. Each one was a Soldier, but each one was different. Special.</p>
<p>Unique. And they always would be. Forever. And the Worker who commanded them, their savior, the one who had given them identity and a soul looked at the other Soldiers and felt his heart stir.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later that day, Pawn found himself in line at Krshia’s stall. The other customers—mainly Gnolls—gave him very odd looks, but his [Humble Presence] skill helped so none of them ran away or screamed.</p>
<p>Krshia blinked when she saw Pawn.</p>
<p>“I did not expect to see a Worker here, yes? But you are…Pawn. Is there anything I can do for you? The Antinium do not usually need to purchase things from the city, yes?”</p>
<p>“No. I mean, yes?”</p>
<p>Pawn wasn’t sure what to say. The Gnoll standing in front of him didn’t seem hostile, which made him feel good. But she did look—tired.</p>
<p>Tired, and poor, so much as that could be used to describe any person. But Pawn remembered her old stall, and her old array of goods. Krshia’s new stall was smaller, and she was clearly selling less. It made his heart hurt, but it hurt less when he told her what he wanted.</p>
<p>“Paint. As much paint as you have, in every color. Except brown or black. I will buy all of it from you.”</p>
<p>The Gnoll blinked.</p>
<p>“All? All is an odd word, Mister Pawn, yes? I have many friends for whom I may sell goods on their behalf. How much paint do you need in buckets?”</p>
<p>“All. Everything I can afford.”</p>
<p>And Pawn put the bag full of gold coins on the table and Krshia’s mouth fell open. She blinked at him. He stared back.</p>
<p>“And paintbrushes. I only need around twenty of those.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That night, Soldiers went to sleep in their barracks. They were Soldiers, but each one was different. Each one was unique. Painted.</p>
<p>In a Hive full of thousands of Antinium, Soldiers and Workers alike, these Soldiers stood out. They sat in their cubicles, for once too excited to sleep.</p>
<p>They were all painted. They all had identities. The paint was dry on their chitin and true, some had already begun to flake off around their joints. But that was the thing about paint. It could always be reapplied. But the meaning lasted forever.</p>
<p>And word had spread, in the Soldier’s own silent way, about what the twenty who had gone above had seen and experienced. A new world, new people. And so as the Soldier slept, or rather, didn’t, they wondered.</p>
<p>Was this what it meant to be a Soldier? They thought they’d known what being a Soldier was. But for the first time, they realized there was more. More they didn’t understand. More they <em>wanted</em> to understand. And so they began to think. They thought of themselves as people rather than tools. They thought of themselves as individuals with identities rather than a mass. They thought of themselves as [Soldiers] rather than Soldiers.</p>
<p>And they began to level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That night, Lyon practically sang as she cleaned up the inn. The place was full of dirty dishes. She didn’t care. She’d been slicing and frying bees up all day, and there were insect parts all over her kitchen. She didn’t care. She was exhausted. She didn’t care. The floorboards were covered with paint. She didn’t—</p>
<p>Okay, she cared about that a bit. The paint Erin had bought was very, <em>very</em> difficult to get rid of no matter how hard Lyon scrubbed.</p>
<p>But she had done it. She’d earned money selling bees, and the inn had been crowded and full! Lyonette stared at the bag full of gleaming coins on one table and sighed happily.</p>
<p>She’d done it, hadn’t she? She’d really done it. And the best part about tonight, the best part was—</p>
<p>She wasn’t alone.</p>
<p>Mrsha happily jumped about the room, leaping from table to table like some horrible furry frog. Lyonette didn’t mind. She’d already cleared those tables of dishes, and truthfully, she felt much like Mrsha. Part of her wanted to leap about with the Gnoll, and maybe she would.</p>
<p>It was just how good Lyon felt. She felt younger again, freer. No—she felt more free and more happy than she’d ever felt back in the palace. She’d done something by herself, with her own hard work.</p>
<p>And she was no longer alone.</p>
<p>Mrsha would stay here tonight. It wasn’t as if Lyon didn’t have enough beds, and the small Gnoll didn’t seem averse to sharing her bed. And Selys hadn’t objected to the idea after she’d seen how well Lyonette had done.</p>
<p>Okay, fine, Selys had objected a lot, even though Lyon had showed her all the coin she’d made. The Drake had been dead set on bringing Mrsha back into the city. She’d tried to chase Mrsha down and drag her out of the inn for the better part of twenty minutes before she’d collapsed in exhaustion.</p>
<p>So Mrsha would stay. Lyonette had promised Selys that she would keep an eye on Mrsha again. And Lyon would. Mrsha was…</p>
<p>The Gnoll belonged here. Just like Lyon did, in a way. And both Gnoll and girl were happy. That was how Lyon ate a messy bunch of slightly burnt crepes slathered with honey next to Mrsha as the Gnoll lapped at a bowl of milk, and the two laughed as Lyon fed the fire and cleaned up.</p>
<p>It was a perfect night. Perfect, even though Lyon had to pick up bug wings and legs and toss them far into the snow. Her hands were grimy from cleaning and she was covered in sweat. But Lyonette was proud.</p>
<p>And Mrsha was jumping around a bit too much.</p>
<p>“Careful, Mrsha! Why don’t you calm down?”</p>
<p>The Gnoll barely listened to Lyon. Okay, maybe she’d had a bit <em>too</em> much honey. Lyon could only let the Gnoll tire herself out as she kept washing dishes and cleaning up. This really was a lot of work, even if you had a Skill, which Lyonette didn’t. How had Erin done it? She’d told Lyon that she used to take care of the inn before Toren had…been created. How?</p>
<p>Lyon just shook her head wearily as she went back into the common room for the last stack of dishes. She looked to see if Mrsha had finally stopped jumping, and then raised her voice in alarm.</p>
<p>“<em>Mrsha!</em>”</p>
<p>The Gnoll jumped guiltily as she pawed at a familiar chessboard sitting in a corner of the room. Lyonette ran over, good mood vanished by sudden panic.</p>
<p>“Mrsha! Don’t—oh no.”</p>
<p>The Gnoll leapt away as Lyon reached the chessboard. She looked down in dismay. The small Gnoll had scattered the ghostly pieces and tried to build a tower out of some of them. She fled as Lyonette anxiously reclaimed the board. In dismay, the girl stared down at the chess pieces.</p>
<p>“Oh no. Erin’s game!”</p>
<p>Of course Lyonette knew the chessboard was an extremely valuable magical artifact, if a relatively pointless one. And she knew Erin was an undisputed master of the game. And she knew…</p>
<p>That messing up Erin’s chessboard was a very bad idea. Not least because the [Innkeeper] would go ballistic, but because whomever was on the other side of the board would probably be upset too.</p>
<p>With that in mind, Lyonette frantically tried to rearrange the pieces. But she had no idea of how the game had even looked! So…she put the chess pieces back in their original places, ready for a new game.</p>
<p>She knew how to do that much, at least. Chess had just been spreading in her country when she’d run away, and she’d learned a lot from watching Erin play. Mrsha peeked up onto the table while Lyonette was resetting the board, insatiably curious and only slightly guilty.</p>
<p>“Stop that!”</p>
<p>Lyonette swatted away a curious paw as Mrsha reached for a knight. The Gnoll gave her a hurt look, and Lyon’s heart nearly broke.</p>
<p>“You little…okay, you can touch since it’s too late. But only touch! Don’t move the board, okay?”</p>
<p>Eagerly, Mrsha picked up the ghostly pieces and tried to gnaw on one. Lyon had to stop her again, but truth be told she couldn’t blame the Gnoll. The chess pieces were like frozen air, the purest expression of magic. And the game…</p>
<p>“See? This is how you play. Like this.”</p>
<p>Lyon showed Mrsha how the pieces moved. The Gnoll stared uncomprehendingly as Lyonette moved a pawn forwards and back, and the bishop diagonally. She sniffed at the board—</p>
<p>And jumped backwards off the table, hair on end as a piece on the other side of the board moved. Lyon yelped and nearly fell out of her chair. When she got back up, heart pounding, she saw a piece had moved.</p>
<p>Just a pawn. It had come out diagonally to counter the pawn she’d pushed forwards. The breath caught in Lyon’s chest in horror.</p>
<p>The other person. The unseen player, the one who’d sent Erin the chess board. They’d seen her moving the pieces. And they thought she was Erin.</p>
<p>And they wanted to play.</p>
<p>What should she do? Lyon panicked for a good minute before the choice was taken out of her hands. Having lost her fright, Mrsha peeked her head over the board and stared curiously at the two pieces on the board. Reaching the conclusion that this was some sort of game without actually understanding the nature of the game, she pushed another pawn forwards to see what would happen.</p>
<p>“Mrsha!”</p>
<p>Instantly, another piece moved, a knight. Lyon stared at it despairingly. But it was too late now. The other player clearly wanted to play. And Erin wasn’t here and Lyon was…curious. So she played.</p>
<p>Why? Because it might be ruder just to leave the other player hanging. And this way, they would surely realize that it <em>wasn’t</em> Erin on the other end. Sure enough, after Lyon had lost both a knight and bishop in quick succession (which she was sure wasn’t a good thing), she sensed the player on the other end pause.</p>
<p>Had they gotten angry and left? No. After a minute, the play resumed, but differently. The moves were no longer lightning-sharp and too hard for Lyonette to counter. Instead, the pieces marched across the board, giving her a challenge, but not one she couldn’t figure out. Mrsha stared at the chess pieces, first fascinated, then bored. To make her behave, Lyon gave her some firewood and some of the leftover paint. The Gnoll happily colored the log with a paw while Lyon played first one game, then two. Three.</p>
<p>After the third game, which she won somehow, Lyon saw the pieces on the board quickly rearrange themselves. She waited—the white side was on the other end of the board—but no movement came.</p>
<p>The mysterious chess player was done for the night. And so Lyon stood up from the board, feeling a bit ashamed. Surely the player was disappointed she wasn’t Erin. But…</p>
<p>She felt good. Was this what Erin liked about chess? It was so odd, having to think in such a way. But Lyonette liked it, strangely. It was different and new. How could she have lived here for so long without trying the game once? How could she have been so…small?</p>
<p>The girl’s head lowered. So much done wrong. So many things that were her fault. But she couldn’t wallow in misery long. She felt a wet nose on her leg and saw Mrsha had finished with her log.</p>
<p>“So colorful! And you have paint all over your fur. Oh no. We’d better clean you up.”</p>
<p>The Gnoll wriggled and tried to get away, but Lyonette had her washing her fur with oil and lye soap in hot water soon enough. It took many trips to the stream in the cold of the night to get enough water, but Lyonette didn’t care.</p>
<p>Mrsha was her responsibility. So was the inn. So she cleaned up what she could, got as much paint off of Mrsha and the floor, and went to bed, exhausted.</p>
<p>But smiling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Barmaid Level 8!]</p>
<p>[Skill – Basic Cleaning obtained!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Carer Class Obtained!]</p>
<p>[Carer Level 2!]</p>
<p>[Skill – Calming Touch obtained!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Tactician Class Obtained!]</p>
<p>[Tactician Level 1!]</p>
<p>[Skill – Lesser Intuition obtained!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Across the world from where the [Princess] sat up in bed and shouted in surprise, making the small Gnoll sleeping next to her tumble away in fright, Niers Astoragon, the Titan, sat in front of his very small chessboard, a dark expression on his face.</p>
<p>He wasn’t smiling. Rather, he was staring hard at the pieces on the board.</p>
<p>“So. The mystery player is gone and someone else has found the board. Someone who knows chess but has barely played it, if at all.”</p>
<p>He mused to himself as he sat, staring at the board. He wasn’t in his command tent in the field now. No, rather he was sitting in the smallest room of the inn his company had hired for its officers on the way back to their personal lands.</p>
<p>It was the smallest room, true, and all of his students and lieutenants had objected. But to Niers, the smallest room in the inn was still a huge space. So he had told them to shut up and move his belongings inside. They obeyed. Even though he was small, the Titan in a bad mood was frightening to be around.</p>
<p>And Niers had been in a bad mood for over a week now. His students tiptoed around him and the soldiers under his command leapt to obey his orders or stayed far out of the way. Niers stood up and paced around the huge desk he’d put his belongings on.</p>
<p>There weren’t many. Niers passed by his arms, the magical items he carried into every battle, the artifacts any commander of Baleros carried, and stared at two things. The chessboard he’d sent across the world, and a letter that still smelled of lavender, edged with gold.</p>
<p>Two things, both tempting his loyalty. Niers closed his eyes. Magnolia didn’t interest him as much as the chessboard—although the woman still had a way of digging her words into his skin like barbs—but she was on the same continent as his missing opponent.</p>
<p>Maybe he could…?</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>That was what Niers said. He sat back at the chessboard, staring at it darkly. He could play this new opponent of course. Maybe he, she, or it would eventually give the board back or find its true owner. Maybe.</p>
<p>But for now Niers couldn’t bear to play such games. He sat in front of the board, scowling darkly as the one candle he’d lit flickered in the dark room. He sat, staring at the chess pieces, the letter, and then at the window. He had a job. A duty. He was the second-in-command of one of the four Great Companies of Baleros. He couldn’t leave.</p>
<p>He told himself that. But his eyes always strayed back to the chessboard.</p>
<p>Waiting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the same continent as Niers’ mysterious chess opponent and the famous Lady Magnolia, two hooded figures walked through blowing snow, keeping their cloaks wrapped tightly around them to protect them from the chill.</p>
<p>In theory, it was two people. In fact, the two travelers were followed by a rather large bevy of people, horses, and supplies that in theory were there to make their journey as pleasant and as safe as possible.</p>
<p>In truth, it just annoyed the Drake General walking in front to no end. He grunted irritably as his companion kicked up a small cloud of snow into his face.</p>
<p>“Did you <em>need</em> to bring all your attendants with you, Ilvriss? We could have been there by now if we didn’t have to wait for these stupid horses.”</p>
<p>The Drake walking in front of him cast a dark glance backwards.</p>
<p>“Be silent, Shivertail. Not everyone has a Skill to let them run. And unlike you, I’m a Lord of the Wall. My position demands—”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, shut up. You didn’t have to come with me, you know.”</p>
<p>Zel Shivertail sighed and marched forwards. Ilvriss matched his pace, and the two Drakes walked forwards in the snow, silent, both of them disliking each other’s presence. Disliking, but tolerating the other out of respect as well. And after a moment, Ilvriss spoke.</p>
<p>“I did have to come.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>They walked on. After a few minutes, Ilvriss spoke.</p>
<p>“…Hard to see anything in this damn snow. We passed the Blood Fields a day ago. How much further now?”</p>
<p>“One more day, I think.”</p>
<p>“And you’re sure you can find this Human in Liscor?”</p>
<p>“No. But it’s a place to start, and as I’ve said, I have business in the Human lands.”</p>
<p>“Well, let’s keep on moving then.”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>They walked on, silent, marching through the snow. And they were not the only ones headed towards Liscor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They marched on a similar route, also north, but far from any road. It was out of necessity they did so; they did not want to be seen. Not for fear of being attacked, but rather of alerting those who would watch their every move.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, moving so far from the main road meant they were more likely to be attacked. The raiding force of Goblins had been a hundred strong. The last of them now gasped and died in the snow.</p>
<p>The group studied the dying Goblin dispassionately. He had worn tough metal armor, painted black, and even carried a slightly magical sword. None of it had done him or his friends any good.</p>
<p>“More delays.”</p>
<p>That was all one said. He fanned his wings. The Antinium spat and acid melted snow into steam.</p>
<p>Another nodded. She had no wings, and her carapace was royal blue. And she held a staff in her hands and her eyes glowed with magic. She whispered a spell, and the snowstorm around them stopped.</p>
<p>“We are close. Continue onwards.”</p>
<p>The band of Antinium turned and marched away from the scene of their latest encounter without a word. Antinium, not the faceless Soldiers or humble Workers, but warriors far different from those in Liscor. Warriors from four Hives, marching in the snow.</p>
<p>North. To Liscor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A woman made of bone walked through the snow, tireless, her eyes burning in the darkness. She was undead, a construct of death, a being of unimaginable power.</p>
<p>A dark shadow flowed at her side, something that moved without revealing its true form. The two moved through the snow, swift, silent.</p>
<p>They had been moving thusly for three days. And they had covered a lot of ground, it was true. But after the moon began to rise overhead the shadow seemed compelled to speak. She cleared her throat with a wet, <em>squelching</em> sound and spoke with a whisper that would have chilled the hearts of any living being that heard it.</p>
<p>But there were not living beings to hear, and the voice wasn’t quite so menacing as uncertain.</p>
<p>“Venitra. Are we lost?”</p>
<p>The woman, the armored knight made of bone, Venitra ignored the question. She and her companion, Ijvani, were on a mission to find the girl, the Courier, the Runner. They had been sent by their great master, Az’kerash. Being lost was…not acceptable. It couldn’t be happening.</p>
<p>Many people were travelling to Liscor. It was just that some of them didn’t matter because they were roughly seventy miles off course and heading the wrong way.</p>

		<p>When Lyonette woke up in her bed and felt the winter daylight on her face, she smiled up at the ceiling, so widely she thought her lips would break.</p>
<p>She’d gained two classes. Two. And she’d leveled up!</p>
<p>Part of Lyon had been afraid that it was all a dream. But the voice in her head—it was undeniable.</p>
<p>She’d leveled. Lyonette hugged her pillow as she curled up. In doing so, she rolled over and nearly squashed the ball of fluff sleeping next to her.</p>
<p>“Oh no. Sorry, Mrsha!”</p>
<p>Lyonette heard a noise of protest from the still sleeping Mrsha. Tiny claws poked her as the young Gnoll reached out and stole the blanket back. Lyon smiled at the round, furry little creature and patted her on the head.</p>
<p>A mouth came up and <em>nipped</em> at Lyonette’s hand, making her yelp. Mrsha cracked one brown eye open and stared at the girl balefully. The message was clear: petting was only for happy, awake Gnolls.</p>
<p>For a while, Lyon lay in her bed. But soon the needs of the day got her up. She stood, dressed, and soon found herself paying a visit to the cold outhouse. It was well-crafted of course, and relatively warmer than the outside. But only just. Lyon sat on the toilet, shivering, but still smiling.</p>
<p>She’d leveled. She had. It wasn’t a dream. She now had both the [Carer] <em>and </em>[Tactician] class, from taking care of Mrsha and playing chess respectively.</p>
<p>Two new classes on top of her [Barmaid] class. As Lyon hurried back into the inn she marveled at the thought. How long had it been since she’d last leveled up in her ‘chosen’ class? Four years?</p>
<p>Yes. Four years.</p>
<p>Lyonette stood with the glass of water in her hand, watering the flowers as she stared out one frosted window at the snowy world. It was cold, lifeless, and beautiful. There was something terrifying about it as well, a sense that if you wandered out into that vast, unforgiving landscape you would die, in this place where civilization ended.</p>
<p>Of course, when Lyonette went to the window facing Liscor she saw a city full of people and beyond that, villages scattered across hilltops. It was only the southern window that was so bleak. But she liked that window. It showed her a world she’d never dreamed of in the palace where she’d grown up.</p>
<p>That place had been…Lyonette sighed as she went outside, bundled up, and tromped through the snow towards the stream, two buckets in hand.</p>
<p>She’d hated it. She’d hated not leveling, and she’d hated how boring everything had seemed. So she’d run off. To become an adventurer, or perhaps find a class meant for her. She hadn’t had any idea of what that meant—to the Lyon of now, the past her seemed so idiotic.</p>
<p>Staggering, Lyon walked back to the inn, the filled buckets of water straining her arms. It hurt, even walking this short distance with so much weight. But her arms were getting stronger. She was gaining muscle and more importantly—</p>
<p>She was leveling up in a class. A [Barmaid] class, true, something completely unbefitting her heritage. But a class nonetheless.</p>
<p>Part of Lyonette shivered with delight at how <em>wrong</em> it all was. She was a [Princess]! If her family knew how badly she was sullying her position by taking such a class—her mother even hated letting the princes take [Knight] and [Commander] classes.</p>
<p>It was a waste of her potential. But it wasn’t at the same time. Lyonette didn’t care about her duties right now. She just wanted to live here, in this inn, and finally realize her dream. Level. She had the [Carer] class and even a [Tactician] class! She wanted to level both up. She wanted to—</p>
<p>The girl had to put down one of the buckets to push the door open. When she did, she saw a familiar white, furry Gnoll cub running around the room anxiously. Mrsha ran in circles, hair standing on end, clearly in great distress.</p>
<p>“Mrsha!”</p>
<p>When the Gnoll saw Lyonette she cannonballed into the girl’s stomach, nearly making Lyon spill both buckets. She clung to Lyon, sniffing at her and hugging her tightly.</p>
<p>She’d thought Lyon was gone. Gone, just like Erin and Ryoka. That nearly made Lyon cry; she held Mrsha tightly.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’m here. I’m not going to leave. I just went to get water, see?”</p>
<p>When she showed Mrsha the buckets, the Gnoll eagerly helped Lyonette bring them into the kitchen, although Mrsha had to push the heavy bucket across the wooden floor. Lyon let her do it; it was a cute sight and Mrsha wanted to help. And Lyonette understood wanting to help, wanting to be useful.</p>
<p>And in this inn, Lyonette <em>was</em> useful. No—it was more like she was essential if Erin wasn’t here. Without her working hard, the fire wouldn’t be fed, and there would be no water, no food. The flowers would die, and this little Gnoll would starve. That was what got Lyonette up even when it was bitingly cold and made her work and count coins. She was responsible for a life now, and that was precious to her.</p>
<p>Yes, she was needed here. Far more than she’d ever been back in her home, in her kingdom. Damn being a [Princess]. Lyonette thought that, and paused.</p>
<p>She only hated the class because she never leveled in it. But she knew…if only she could level. But she didn’t know how. It was too hard back at home. Too hard, because everything was too easy, and she was useless.</p>
<p>But what had Erin said one time?</p>
<p>“You’d be like a temporary innkeeper. This would be my castle, and I would be like a [Princess]…”</p>
<p>Mrsha looked up at Lyon in confusion, tail wagging frantically. The girl had to smile at the Gnoll as she patted her head.</p>
<p>“Let’s make breakfast, okay? I’m hungry and your stomach is rumbling. And while we do—would you like to hear a story, Mrsha?”</p>
<p>The Gnoll nodded as she followed Lyon into the kitchen. There she watched greedily as Lyon cut thick slices of bacon and laid them gently in a pan to <em>sizzle</em> and <em>pop.</em> The girl had bought the precious and expensive meat for guests, mainly the Antinium, but today was a special day, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>Bacon sizzling, Lyonette found part of a loaf and sliced the slightly stale bread up. A bit of warming by the fire and some butter and more importantly, honey and it would be a treat. She still had three huge jars of honey, honeycomb, and even some royal jelly sitting in the inn after all.</p>
<p>Life was good. Lyon fried the bacon—she was getting better at making it crispy, not black—spilling a half-cooked slice on the floor. Not entirely by accident either—a certain Gnoll ramming into her legs had caused the mishap.</p>
<p>“Stop that, you!”</p>
<p>Lyonette scolded Mrsha as the Gnoll pounced on the greasy bacon slice. The young Gnoll looked up at her guiltily with her huge eyes and Lyon had to forgive her.</p>
<p>“Sit there and let me finish. I’ll tell you that story now. Did you know that there are types of classes in this world?”</p>
<p>The Gnoll sat on her butt, tail wagging as she chewed on the bacon and stared up at Lyon. She stared curiously at Lyon as the girl spoke, her eyes on the pan.</p>
<p>“Oh yes. Everyone knows there are classes, but when I was a girl—my family has many secrets. Many old secrets about the world and classes and levels. My father insisted I learn each one, as part of my tutoring. And do you know? I learned that some classes are better than others.”</p>
<p>The Gnoll scooted forwards, eyes wide, ears perked up. Lyonette laughed as she put a slice of crispy bacon on a plate.</p>
<p>“Yes, not all classes are equal. Of course, each one is important, but some are <em>more</em> important, see? Like classes that influence people. There are [Tacticians] and [Strategists] and classes that only [Soldiers] can take like [Sergeant] and [Commander] of course…but the best of all such classes is probably [General] or [Admiral].”</p>
<p>Mrsha just blinked at Lyon. How much did she understand? Lyonette didn’t know her age, but she thought Mrsha was young by any standard. Still, she continued.</p>
<p>“A [General] can have influence over a whole army. Thousands, maybe even tens of thousands of people. Isn’t that amazing? She or he can even affect other armies with Skills that demoralize or frighten…but there are classes that can do the same outside of battle. [Lords] and [Ladies] have their own demesne, and [Farmers] control their plots of land. You see? Some classes have <em>range.</em>”</p>
<p>Mrsha nodded and sneezed. Perhaps the nod was because of the sneeze? Lyon took it as a good sign.</p>
<p>“So what my mother told me was that the best classes can touch entire kingdoms. Like royal classes. [King], [Queen], [Princess]…a family of rulers can all make their nation strong.”</p>
<p>If they had high levels. Lyonette swallowed a lump in her throat.</p>
<p>“So these classes are some of the best. Because they are so rare, and only a few can have them. [Lords] for example are strong and have good Skills. But a [King] will have greater skills. There is no stronger class, in that sense. Well…”</p>
<p>The girl had to pause.</p>
<p>“…I suppose [Emperor] or [Empress] <em>might</em> be better. Because there can be only one, you see? A [King] can rule with a [Queen] and even [Princes] and [Princesses] all adding their Skills together. But an [Emperor] can rule over many nations, so only their Skills would affect the entire empire.”</p>
<p>Mrsha began scratching at her side, a clear indication that Lyon was losing her. The girl scowled; but the bacon was nearly done.</p>
<p>“Fine. You don’t like that? Then how about this? This is the secret my parents taught me. Royal classes, rare classes, and special classes—the kind that appear when two classes merge—they’re all better than normal ones. A [Lord] has almost the same Skills as a [General]. He can fight and lead, but he can also empower his estate. A [Blademaster] will have far, far better Skills than any [Warrior]—even a normal [Knight]! And you can get special classes by doing secret things. In fact, a [Princess] can even give someone a unique class.”</p>
<p>The Gnoll stared up at Lyonette, and then flopped over on her back. Her stomach rumbled loudly, and Lyonette sighed. It wasn’t important to Mrsha. It was special to Lyonette, but only because she needed it to be. Why would a Gnoll child care what a [Princess] could do?</p>
<p>“<em>Fine.</em> Let’s eat!”</p>
<p>Bacon and honey-covered bread for breakfast was a sinfully delicious meal. Lyonette ate nearly as fast as Mrsha, although the smaller Gnoll had even less manners than she did. She greedily chewed down the fatty bacon, pausing only to lick her paws clean of grease and honey every now and then.</p>
<p>When breakfast was done, Lyonette found something for Mrsha to do. She’d realized the Gnoll needed a distraction, so she found some parchment and charcoal. The Gnoll sat on the ground, happily drawing while Lyon cleaned the tables and washed the dishes.</p>
<p>She wished she had some of her toys, the ones she’d had back in the palace. The Gnoll deserved some fun. Maybe she could buy something? She had a good amount of coin after Pawn had come by—a lot, in fact. When Olesm came, Lyonette could probably persuade him to go shopping, but would the Drake even know what a Gnoll liked? Perhaps…</p>
<p>Lyonette was scrubbing at a bit of solidified honey on the table when she saw movement. She looked up and realized it wasn’t Mrsha but something else. Cautiously Lyonette moved over and saw the thing <em>move</em> again. She was tempted to grab a frying pan before she investigated, but then memory nudged her and she realized what it had to be.</p>
<p>A white, wriggling larvae, big and fat and sitting in a pool of royal jelly stared blindly up at Lyon while she stared down in disgusted fascination.</p>
<p>The grub! She’d completely forgotten about it! Lyon had intended to give it to Pawn, but it had slipped her mind. Now the grub moved slowly in the white goo surrounding it.</p>
<p>It was still alive, and even fatter than it had been yesterday if her eyes didn’t deceive her. Lyon stared at it in horrified fascination. The grub was ugly as sin, and sightless to boot. Still, Lyonette had the crazy urge to poke at it like Mrsha had done.</p>
<p>Resisting that instinct, Lyon frowned as she considered the liquid in the bowl. It was lower than yesterday as well. Some had evaporated? Or—the larvae had eaten some. It was growing.</p>
<p>Well, that only meant Pawn would like it more when she gave it to him, right? Lyonette decided to make sure the grub survived. That meant adding more royal jelly—she’d heard that was best for bees to grow with.</p>
<p>There were several honeycombs in the jars that she’d cut from the hive. Lyonette could see pockets of the white, jelly-like substance, and tried to fish it out so she could refill the bowl with the larvae in it. To that end she had to reach into the jar full of honey with a clean hand, giggling and shuddering at the odd feeling of so much honey.</p>
<p>She decided to separate as much of the jelly from the honey as she could, in case she needed it later. So Lyonette found another jar and used a wooden spoon to transfer the jelly over. It was a messy and sticky maneuver, and it invariably attracted Mrsha. The Gnoll licked both the royal jelly and honey up as Lyonette tried to fend her off.</p>
<p>“Stop it, Mrsha! Mrsha! You’ve just had breakfast! You’re going to get so <em>fat.</em>”</p>
<p>Which wouldn’t actually be a bad thing. The Gnoll was still thinner than she should be, which is why Lyonette let her lick her palms clean, giggling as the tiny rough tongue greedily lapped up the sticky honey.</p>
<p>The grub wriggled when Lyonette poured the royal jelly over it, but in the end it was nearly covered except for its head again. That done, she placed the bowl nearer to the fire. Not too near—but close enough that the grub wouldn’t freeze during the night.</p>
<p>That was how Lyon spent the first hour of her morning. After that, the door opened and Selys came by. The Drake wasn’t working today, and so she’d come—anxious and worried—to check on Mrsha. The Gnoll was happy to see her since the Drake wasn’t trying to take her away, and she definitely enjoyed the toys Selys had brought.</p>
<p>“I bought these for her. They’re very popular with Gnolls but Mrsha never wanted to play back at my apartment.”</p>
<p>So said Selys as she sat at a table, enjoying some honey and bread and a glass of honeyed water in the warm inn. Lyonette buzzed around the kitchen, making more honey water—she had the idea it would be very popular with the Antinium—and storing it in another jar for later. The inn was full of life, and guests! Not just Mrsha, but Selys had come to visit!</p>
<p>And—surprisingly—Olesm as well. The Drake came by every few days, less and less often since Lyon made him go shopping for her each time, but he arrived not long after Selys, tail wagging with excitement.</p>
<p>“Is Erin—oh.”</p>
<p>He always said that. But he didn’t look as disappointed today. Instead, he happily joined Selys at a table, eating some of her honeyed bread, oblivious to her annoyed look while he waved a sheaf of parchment about, unable to contain his excitement.</p>
<p>“You won’t <em>believe</em> what just happened. I was in the city and Hawk—you know, the <em>Courier—</em>came over with all these letters! One had just been sent, and when he got to Liscor to deliver them, the Runner’s Guild told him there were tons of undelivered letters all addressed to me!”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t the Runners deliver them?”</p>
<p>“Well—oh, thank you. Is…why is this water sweet?”</p>
<p>“It’s honey.”</p>
<p>Lyon explained as Olesm suspiciously tasted the water in the glass with a long tongue.</p>
<p>“Oh! It’s good! You should sell this! Can I have more bread? Selys has run out. Anyways, you won’t believe what happened! When I was sending all my letters out, I misspelled my name! So when I got the replies—they were all addressed to Oresm, not Olesm! I can’t believe no one at the Guild picked up on that mistake!”</p>
<p>Lyonette laughed, but Selys gave Olesm and exasperated look.</p>
<p>“Oresm? By all the Ancestors, how did you manage to misspell your <em>own name</em> when you sent all those letters?”</p>
<p>He hunched over, tail twitching defensively.</p>
<p>“I was excited! And I had good reason—do you know what I sent? Chess games!”</p>
<p>“You mean like the one Erin got? So what?”</p>
<p>Selys remained unimpressed. Olesm rolled his eyes, speaking faster as he tried to explain and convey his enthusiasm to an unreceptive audience.</p>
<p>“I didn’t <em>just </em>send chess puzzles. Don’t you get it? I sent the chess puzzle Erin made—the really hard one—as well as actual games she played! I managed to use the annotation system she taught me—with it you can go through her chess games step by step and see how it played out without needing to be there!”</p>
<p>“So what?”</p>
<p>“So <em>you can recreate chess games across the world!</em> And play them, too! I copied that game she played against all of the Antinium—and the games she played on the magical chessboard! They’re a goldmine for any [Tactician] or [Strategist], don’t you see? It’s been less than a month since I sent out the letters—open messages to major cities, just the nearest ones that I could afford—and I’ve gotten back so many replies!”</p>
<p>Excitedly, he showed the two young females the letters. Lyonette had to admit, the stationary collection did seem impressive. Selys didn’t understand the significance, but Lyonette could see the quality of the letters was high in some cases, and some had personal sigils or seals. In a political sense, Olesm had suddenly accrued quite a bit of attention.</p>
<p>“Okay, so some [Tacticians] are excited about chess. It’s a popular game. So what?”</p>
<p>“Would you stop <em>saying</em> that?”</p>
<p>“So. What?”</p>
<p>“So—people want me to send them more chess games! I’m talking with the head [Strategist] of one of the Walled Cities, see? He told me the chess puzzle I sent helped him <em>level</em>! And this—the letter that came by Courier actually sent back some money!”</p>
<p>Selys choked on her drink when Olesm showed her the gold coins.</p>
<p>“<em>What?</em> People are sending you money for your stupid chess games?”</p>
<p>“Of course! Don’t you understand? This can help high-level [Strategists] level further! And if we can play chess by mail—I’m already planning on sending more of Erin’s games and more of the chess puzzles she taught me. I just…have to solve some of them.”</p>
<p>Olesm coughed, a bit embarrassed. Lyonette and Selys just stared at him.</p>
<p>“But when I do send them out, I’m not going to just stay on this continent. I’ll pay to have them delivered as a bulk shipment to every major city in the world! In a few months…just think of the possibilities!”</p>
<p>It was all a bit over Selys’ head, and the female Drake argued with Olesm over the cost of what she called his ‘silly project’, but Lyonette just sat, staring at the pile of letters Olesm so lovingly clutched, heart pounding.</p>
<p>This <em>was</em> big news. If Olesm was right, he might well be able to form a network of his own between [Tacticians]. Lyonette had—grudgingly—been taught history and she knew that this was how organizations like the Adventurer’s Guild, Runner’s Guild, and so on had been created.</p>
<p>She smiled at Olesm. She was happy for him. The Drake smiled back, and then Lyonette told them her big news of the day.</p>
<p>“I’ve got two new classes. [Carer] and [Tactician].”</p>
<p>Gaining new classes in any society was usually cause for congratulations and celebration, depending on the class. It wasn’t as dramatic as when people celebrated hitting their tenth or twentieth level—or the huge parties when people managed to reach Level 30—but Olesm and Selys still made approving sounds.</p>
<p>Olesm was curious about Lyon’s [Tactician] class—he screamed when she told him about playing on the magical chessboard and told her to play <em>him</em> instead, but Selys was more curious about Lyon’s other class.</p>
<p>“[Carer]? Is that really a class?”</p>
<p>Lyonette nodded, stroking Mrsha’s head as the Gnoll played with a wicker ball, rolling it across the floor and leaping after it. It was one of the toys Selys had brought and Lyonette was glad that it was too big for Mrsha to swallow.</p>
<p>“It is in my ki—my country. On Terandria. People get it for taking care of children, or the elderly.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t exactly a common class, but Lyonette knew some of the older [Lords] and [Ladies] employed people with such classes to help take care of them, just as the [Governess] who had looked after her had been an advanced form of that class.</p>
<p>“Don’t Drakes and Gnolls have a class like that?”</p>
<p>Selys and Olesm shook their heads, looking bemused. Selys scratched at a patch of dry scales on her wrist as she spoke.</p>
<p>“If they’re that old, I suppose we’d entrust them to a relative’s care. But I’ve never heard of anyone getting a class from it. Probably because Drakes don’t see it as a job.”</p>
<p>“And Gnolls always have a role in their tribes, no matter how old they get.”</p>
<p>So, Lyonette’s class wasn’t that useful in Liscor, especially since she was banned from the city. But the girl still welcomed it since it would help her deal with Mrsha, and it seemed to reassure Selys that Lyonette could look after her.</p>
<p>After they’d exchanged gossip and Lyonette had learned that Erin was doing well and Ryoka had gone north for some reason, the three adults sat in the inn while Mrsha played. They were all adults, although Lyonette was younger than Selys and Olesm, and even the oldest among them—Selys—wasn’t more than a few years into her twenties.</p>
<p>The two Drakes argued and sat as Lyonette made more food, bustled around the inn, and chatted with them. That was all she did. Just talked. It was all Lyonette wanted. She talked and played chess with Olesm and wondered whether Pawn would come by today.</p>
<p>She hoped he would.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pawn had no bacon to wake him up, nor any honey. Instead, he had a meeting with Klbkch as soon as he had eaten the horrible mush in the Soldier’s mess hall. Given the choice, Pawn would have gladly eaten a vat of the grey-green stuff rather than talk to Klbkch.</p>
<p>But surprisingly, today Klbkch had nothing to criticize Pawn for. Rather, the Revalantor went over yesterday’s patrol with Pawn, highlighting the encounters with monsters and giving Pawn…advice.</p>
<p>“Do not engage the Corusdeer herds if at all possible. They are formidable combatants if roused, and the Soldiers will suffer heavy losses if they fight. Likewise, the Rock Crabs should be engaged with caution if it becomes necessary.”</p>
<p>Pawn sat in a chair before Klbkch’s desk, nodding nervously as the other Antinium spoke with him. It was strange.</p>
<p>“Ah, Revalantor Klbkch.”</p>
<p>The other Antinium paused and looked at him. Pawn realized Klbkch’s new form was slightly taller than the Worker’s form, as well as being slimmer.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Does this mean that you expect me to patrol around Liscor at a later date? Or are these simply things I should keep in mind in general?”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Klbkch had very few papers on his desk, but he extracted one now and slid it across the desk to Pawn. The Worker stared down at it in confusion.</p>
<p>“I cannot read this, Revalantor Klbkch.”</p>
<p>Pawn could only read a few words of the local Drake script—enough to get around by, but not to decipher the words on the parchment.</p>
<p>“Of course. My mistake. I will take steps to ensure you and the other Individuals learn both Drake and Gnoll writing. It is not difficult—Erin picked up the word system very quickly as it apparently closely resembles the Human one.”</p>
<p>Klbkch took the parchment back and tapped it with one finger.</p>
<p>“This is a report to Watch Captain Zevara, detailing the monsters you encountered. I submitted it last night after your patrol returned.”</p>
<p>“And did the Watch Captain deem our patrol worthwhile?”</p>
<p>“She did. Although her praise is not the important issue—while on patrol I overheard several citizens expressing relief that our Soldiers were fighting monsters. Apparently they were observed chasing the Corusdeer herd off.”</p>
<p>Pawn hadn’t noticed any observers. He worried that this was an error.</p>
<p>“Oh. Should we have avoided detection?”</p>
<p>Klbkch shook his head.</p>
<p>“No. And in this case, the [Shepherd] was on a distant hilltop. But forcing the Corusdeer herd to seek grazing areas further from Liscor is considered a public boon, especially to travelers on the northern road who fear angering a herd. Moreover, the Shield Spiders you have slain are considered a public nuisance, and so the Soldiers generated goodwill from that as well. It also helps that people are seeing the Soldiers in a non-hostile environment.”</p>
<p>All of this made sense to Pawn in an oblique way. He had intended none of this of course, but so long as Klbkch seemed pleased by the results, Pawn could relax.</p>
<p>“In short, it appears that your patrol has generated goodwill among the citizenry already. That alone is worth continuing your activities. Take twenty Soldiers with you today and this time retrieve trophies from the monsters you slay. I will increase your stipend of funds as well.”</p>
<p>If Pawn had the ability to do so, his eyes would have widened. He bowed his head.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Revalantor Klbkch. I shall…I shall put the money to good use.”</p>
<p>“Do so. I will expect you to update me if the Soldiers show any positive effects from these patrols. If not…at least they will improve Antinium relations with the city, which is desirable. You may take a second patrol out at your discretion.”</p>
<p>That was all. Pawn stood up to go, but when he got to the door, Klbkch stopped him.</p>
<p>“Pawn.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Revalantor Klbkch?”</p>
<p>“…Why the paint?”</p>
<p>The Worker considered the question, trying to figure out how to explain it to the one Antinium in the Hive who didn’t understand. Well, one of two if you counted the Queen.</p>
<p>“It is a way of naming the Soldiers without using words, Revalantor Klbkch.”</p>
<p>Klbkch sat up in his chair at once and signaled Pawn to sit back down.</p>
<p>“This is very intriguing. Can all Soldiers be ‘named’ and made Individual?”</p>
<p>“I would not attempt to do so with the Soldiers not under my command. They may become Aberration.”</p>
<p>“I see. But you believe the Soldiers under your command have all become Individual? Really?”</p>
<p>“I cannot say. They cannot speak after all. But I would guess that they are…closer to Individual than they were before by use of the paint.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Klbkch considered this for a while. Pawn sat at attention until the Revalantor nodded.</p>
<p>“Continue. That is all. We will monitor the Soldiers and your attempts with them before expanding to a larger group. If you notice them leveling or using Skills—”</p>
<p>“I shall report it at once.”</p>
<p>“Good. You are dismissed.”</p>
<p>Pawn left Klbkch’s quarters, feeling elated and relieved at once, which naturally caused giddiness as well. For once he’d done something right! Not just right—something <em>right.</em></p>
<p>He’d given the Soldiers identity. Pawn went to requisition the coin Klbkch had promised him. The Antinium had a room devoted specifically for funds. Pawn saw a few other Workers withdrawing exact amounts and recording the number on a piece of parchment—some had to pay for supplies or perform other exchanges with the citizens of Liscor.</p>
<p>Carefully, Pawn collected gold, silver, and bronze coins from the carefully organized stacks of coin. He stared at the gold coins, and then wondered idly what would happen if he took more. There were thousands, tens of thousands of gold coins in the Hive, the product of over ten years of hard work and little spending. And this was only one of the treasury rooms.</p>
<p>But who cared? The Antinium didn’t post guards on the room because there was no need for them to steal, and no [Thief] would ever make it this far into the hive. Then again, if other Antinium became Individual like Pawn, who knew?</p>
<p>That was a troubling thought. Pawn took no more gold than he was allotted. He carefully walked up towards the entrance of the Hive. It was still early yet; he didn’t want to patrol before he ran a few errands. After all, he could only take twenty Soldiers out of the Hive with him at a time. What about the rest, forced to wait and guard in the tunnels? That had to be boring, so Pawn decided to get them something to make the wait easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You want what?”</p>
<p>Krshia blinked at Pawn. This time her stall was deserted, and Pawn saw that the other customers shopping this early were going to the more prosperous [Shopkeepers]. Again he felt bad, but reassured himself because of the size of the order he was placing.</p>
<p>“Cheese. I would like enough to feed roughly two hundred and forty individuals. Enough for a small meal, at least.”</p>
<p>The Gnoll [Shopkeeper] just stared at Pawn, jaw hanging open. Pawn wondered if he’d made a mistake. Was eating too much cheese a <em>faux paws</em> in Gnollish society?</p>
<p>Yes, cheese was what Pawn wanted. It was tasty and edible and it would go down well with the Soldiers, he felt. That was the only thing he could think of. Meat was too expensive and it spoiled quickly, and besides, it was hard to acquire in the winter. But cheese? Cheese was more plentiful.</p>
<p>And it tasted good.</p>
<p>Pawn stared anxiously at Krshia as the Gnoll struggled with shock.</p>
<p>“If there is an issue in delivery, I can arrange for direct pickups with Workers. And if there is a shortage…”</p>
<p>“No, no.”</p>
<p>Krshia smiled at Pawn, baring her teeth in a wide grin.</p>
<p>“I am simply surprised, yes? Even when my shop was booming, such orders were rare things. I thank you, Worker Pawn, for giving me such business.”</p>
<p>“You are the shopkeeper that Erin trusts. So I trust you.”</p>
<p>That was all it was to Pawn. There could be nothing simpler, nothing easier to understand. But Krshia lowered her head to him as if it meant something truly important.</p>
<p>“Hrr. I am grateful for that. Truly.”</p>
<p>Her shop. Every time Pawn saw it, he remembered what it had been. This time he decided to ask about it, since Krshia didn’t seem to have any customers waiting.</p>
<p>“How has your business been doing lately, Miss Krshia?”</p>
<p>She bared her teeth again, but this time not in a friendly way.</p>
<p>“You can see for yourself, can you not? Rebuilding what was lost is difficult, no? I will survive the winter, but it will be a year or more before I am able to open this shop with pride.”</p>
<p>That hurt too. It was an odd, uncomfortable feeling, hurting for people who were not Pawn himself. He hadn’t known it could happen before he’d met Erin. But this too was part of being alive.</p>
<p>“Is it truly so bad?”</p>
<p>Krshia shrugged, looking tired.</p>
<p>“Truly? It is not the worst. I will not starve and the others, the other Gnolls and even some Drakes have supported me. But it is bad to feel what is lost and know you have fallen, no? Because of one moment. Because of a thief.”</p>
<p>That last word was bitter, and Pawn immediately thought of Lyonette, laughing and serving them all with respect and pride. It was different from the Lyon that Krshia knew.</p>
<p>“I met the Human Lyonette yesterday. In Erin’s absence she has taken over the inn.”</p>
<p>Pawn didn’t know why he was telling Krshia this, especially because the Gnoll stiffened at Lyon’s name. But he felt compelled to, as if sharing the good Lyonette had done would offset some of the bad.</p>
<p>“She has acquired more bees and honey. She served me and a number of Soldiers the food. It was very tasty.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Good for her. I have not had honey myself for many, many moons, yes? It is a valuable thing even when it is not so very cold.”</p>
<p>Krshia’s voice was hard, and he could see she was upset. Pawn thought. He thought quickly about how he could make things better for her, if only in his small way. He thought about Lyon and regret and honey. Then he had an idea.</p>
<p>“I will obtain your cheeses for you, within a few hours, yes? But first we must talk about prices and which cheeses you would like—where are you going?”</p>
<p>Pawn took a few steps away from Krshia’s store. She looked alarmed, but he reassured her.</p>
<p>“I am not reconsidering our deal, but I have a pressing matter to attend to. I shall return within the hour. Please excuse me.”</p>
<p>He could feel the Gnoll’s eyes on his back as he hurried off. Pawn left the city and walked swiftly up a hill to an inn. There he opened the door and talked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Oh! Pawn! It’s so good to see you! Come in, would you like something to eat? Not staying?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Other Soldiers? Later today? Well of—of course! I’ve still got a lot of bees and here, try this honey water. I can get Olesm to buy more meat and make another soup.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Please, Olesm? Please? And I need butter and vegetables—I have a list here. Oh, and let me add…”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Krshia? You’d like to…well of course. I—will you tell her that I—”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“…Thank you. But wait! Before you go, can I offer you this?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“What do you <em>mean</em>, it looks fattening!?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Less than an hour later—less than half an hour later, really, Pawn walked back down the street towards Krshia’s stall. She stared at him. She stared at him, but especially at the huge jar of honey he held, walking carefully so as not to drop it.</p>
<p>Other pedestrians stared at the Worker as well. The jar of golden liquid tended to attract stares, Pawn had noticed.</p>
<p>“I have brought you honey. It is yours to keep and use as you please.”</p>
<p>That was what Pawn said as he placed the jar on Krshia’s counter. The Gnoll just stared at him.</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“I talked with Lyonette. She agreed to give you this jar of honey.”</p>
<p>It was a simple thing. Most things in life were, but Pawn had observed that the way people reacted to simple things was—complex.</p>
<p>Such as now. At the mention of Lyonette’s name, Krshia began to look angry.</p>
<p>“Why did she give this honey to you? Because you paid? Or because it is meant to be an apology?”</p>
<p>“She certainly feels remorse. I believe her acceding to my request was done out of guilt and an interest in helping settle the debt between you two.”</p>
<p>Pawn replied calmly. He watched with interest as Krshia’s ears slowly flattened on her head.</p>
<p>“And what does she call this? Repayment? It is hardly worth my stall, no?”</p>
<p>Some people would have hesitated to tell an angry Gnoll anything. But Pawn only spoke the truth, so his tone was level as he immediately replied.</p>
<p>“I think it is something, rather than nothing. An apology—the beginning of one, at least.”</p>
<p>That made the Gnoll pause. Pawn waited, and then spoke carefully.</p>
<p>“Lyonette has one message she would like to pass on to you with the honey.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“‘I am very sorry.’”</p>
<p>That was all. But it changed things. Simple things, simple words, always did. That was what Pawn had told Lyonette, and why the apology she had given him was this. And what happened was that Krshia stopped growing angrier. She was still angry, but she let Pawn open the jar.</p>
<p>“Would you like to try some? It is sweet, and I am told there may be grubs within the honeycomb.”</p>
<p>The Gnoll sniffed at the honey, and then dipped a finger into the thick liquid. It came out glistening, and Pawn stared at the honey in envy. He liked honey. Maybe he should have gotten some to go with the cheese. He’d go back to ask Lyonette about it later. But this jar was Krshia’s.</p>
<p>“Hmf.”</p>
<p>She licked the honey off of her finger. Slowly, Krshia’s tail began to wag, although her face didn’t change.</p>
<p>“This is good. Sweet. Sweeter than honey from small bees, yes?”</p>
<p>“Mm. I believe so.”</p>
<p>The Gnoll nodded. She stared at Pawn.</p>
<p>“You are an odd Worker, Pawn of the Antinium. But…yes, I believe you and Klbkch are good for this city.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Pawn nodded to Krshia. He felt happy for her words because she clearly meant them. Krshia nodded and smiled. When he left, it was with all the cheese in the marketplace and locations for Workers to pick up more. And Krshia was selling honey in the form of hand-sized jars. There was already a queue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lyonette felt good after Pawn had left. She felt better when he came back with his Soldiers. She cooked and served food again, and that night when she was cleaning up, she couldn’t stop humming.</p>
<p>The jars she and Erin used were truly big. They were taller than her knees and very wide—Erin had paid in gold for them since they were made by expert [Glassblowers]. At the moment she had two jars of honey, one half-empty and one and a quarter jars of&nbsp; dead bees. Even with the Soldiers’ appetite, Lyonette had still a lot left.</p>
<p>Well, she wouldn’t if she was actually feeding the Soldiers a full meal. Then she would have had to give them six or seven bees to fill them up, but two or three for a lunchtime snack was all Pawn had asked for.</p>
<p>And the honey? The honey had brought in more than a few guests—all Drakes—who’d come to drink a few glasses of honeyed water and fill their jars with the sweet honey and honeycomb. It wasn’t exactly filling tables at the inn, but it was more money.</p>
<p>And when Lyonette had sat down with Mrsha to eat a proper meal of shepherd’s pie—courtesy of Selys who taught Lyonette how to make it—they had one more unexpected guest.</p>
<p>Klbkch.</p>
<p>He came into the inn while the two were eating. Lyonette wanted to find him a table, but the Antinium declined.</p>
<p>“I shall not be here long. Rather, I would like to make a purchase.”</p>
<p>“Of the bees?”</p>
<p>Klbkch nodded. He pointed to one of the jars Lyonette kept against the kitchen wall.</p>
<p>“How much…for the entire jar?”</p>
<p>“The entire jar?”</p>
<p>Klbkch nodded, looking at Lyonette’s ecstatic and panicked expression.</p>
<p>“I believe my Queen will enjoy the bees. Will you sell them to me directly?”</p>
<p>That was actually something of a hard question for Lyonette. Should she sell the bees? If she did, she might not have enough for Pawn tomorrow, and he was bringing more Soldiers then as well.</p>
<p>But a whole jar? All of Lyonette’s instincts told her to say yes. After all she could always get more bees, even if she was afraid of taking too much honey from the Hive. She had more flowers—hopefully she could use less this time—and she had to do it sooner or later.</p>
<p>“Of course I’ll sell you—the entire jar, you said?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Will that be an issue?”</p>
<p>“No, no! But the bees—they’re raw. Would you like me to fry them up first? They taste really good when they’re drizzled in honey. Apparently.”</p>
<p>“Hm. We have a [Cook], but perhaps it will be instructive to show him how it is done. By all means, please prepare a third of the jar. I will partake of a few as well to ascertain quality.”</p>
<p>In the end, Lyonette finished eating with Mrsha and then went into the kitchen to cook while the Gnoll played hide and seek with Klbkch. Although that really just involved Klbkch pointing at her while the Gnoll roamed around the inn, trying to be stealthy.</p>
<p>Cut, fry, drizzle. Lyonette worked tirelessly to make the best bees possible, conscious of who would be eating them. The Queen. And also, Klbkch, whom Pawn told Lyon was actually very important in the Hive. Klbkch ate five while he was waiting.</p>
<p>“Thank you. These bees are quite delicious. I may return at a later date if you have more stored away.”</p>
<p>“I will. Thank you for buying them! Have a good night!”</p>
<p>That was how Lyonette spent the rest of her day. She went to bed exhausted, but remembered to put the bee larvae very close to the dying fire as she did. Pawn didn’t want it, and she’d neglected to offer one to Klbkch. It kept slipping her mind. And besides—Lyonette stared at the larvae, wriggling blind in the bowl.</p>
<p>…She might be getting attached to it.</p>
<p>That night, she leveled up in all three of her new classes again, although she got no new Skills. That would have been enough, but Lyonette heard a new announcement after the list of level ups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Beast Tamer Class Obtained!]</p>
<p>[Beast Tamer Level 1!]</p>
<p>[Skill – Healthy Rearing obtained!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Beast Tamer]? Her?</p>
<p>Lyonette couldn’t believe it. But when she woke up, she knew it had happened again.</p>
<p>A new class! Why?</p>
<p>Because she’d taken care of the bee? Because she’d made sure it was warm and fed? Because she’d done all that? Was that all it took?</p>
<p>She couldn’t be a [Beast Tamer]. Of all the classes, Lyonette felt least confident in that one. What purpose would it serve her? Was she going to raise a bee? As a pet? It was a useless class. Well, the [Tactician] class was also useless to her, strictly speaking.</p>
<p>And yet—Lyonette <em>wanted</em> the class. She wanted the [Tactician] class too. And the [Barmaid] class she’d leveled up in! She wanted to level! No matter what class, no matter how few levels!</p>
<p>She wanted them. And from what Lyonettte knew of classes, that was probably why she’d gotten them. Because while other people had no desire to devote their lives to raising animals or monsters and so didn’t get the class even if they owned pets, Lyonette was different.</p>
<p>She had been starved of classes, not leveled while growing up. And now that she was free, truly free—</p>
<p>She’d take all the classes. No matter how damning it might be to her one ‘true’ class. Even if it meant she’d never reach a high level. She never levelled in it anyways.</p>
<p>With that in mind, Lyonette added a new routine to her day. After she watered Erin’s flowers and stoked the fire and before she went to fetch more water, she checked on the bee. It wriggled in the royal jelly and she saw it was a bit larger again. Lyonette wondered whether it would actually grow up—this was no hive. But she could always get more royal jelly and she did have a Skill to help her, after all.</p>
<p>“I guess you’re going to need a name.”</p>
<p>So saying, Lyonette touched the bee gently. It squirmed and it was wet and slimy. Gross, in short. But it was alive, and it struggled to stay alive.</p>
<p>Just like her.</p>
<p>One last thing happened that morning. When Lyonette was trudging back to her inn, she saw a Gnoll pulling a sled up the hill. She froze in fear, but the Gnoll’s sled was loaded with goods.</p>
<p>Food. Lyonette saw meats, vegetables, and all the things she’d asked Olesm to bring, neatly bundled up on the sled. The Gnoll set it down in the snow outside the inn. She—the Gnoll was a she now that Lyonette was closer—turned and saw Lyon with the buckets in hand.</p>
<p>“Delivery.”</p>
<p>That was all she said. She must have been one of the Street Runners the shops hired. But Olesm had told Lyon that no one would deliver to the inn, to her. What had changed?</p>
<p>The Gnoll began walking down the hill. With a start, Lyonette realized she was going.</p>
<p>“Oh. T-thank you so…”</p>
<p>The Gnoll [Runner] made no reply. She just growled something and stomped back down the hill, dragging the sled behind her.</p>
<p>Lyon watched her go. Then she opened the door and had Mrsha help her drag everything inside. She didn’t say much, but she was smiling. And crying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“They are coming.”</p>
<p>That was all Klbkch said to Bird, Pawn, Belgrade, Garry, and Anand when he gathered them together for the first time in his small quarters. It was early morning, just after dawn, in fact. The Workers had been roused—in Pawn’s case from his sleep by the mental order—and told to come here.</p>
<p>Now Klbkch paced back and forth in front of them, clearly agitated. The other Workers said nothing, but they each felt slightly alarmed. None of them had ever seen the Revalantor like this.</p>
<p>“Pardon, Revalantor Klbkch, but who is coming?”</p>
<p>That came from Garry. Pawn hadn’t seen Garry in…so long! Klbkch had even ordered Garry to attend. That was unusual because Garry was specialized now in the [Cook] class—he played no part in commanding Soldiers and indeed, he stayed far away from any area of the Hive where monsters might attack.</p>
<p>“The other Hives. They have sent a delegation, and they will arrive sometime today.”</p>
<p>That was all Klbkch said, but it shocked all the other Workers to their core.</p>
<p>Another Hive? They knew—all the Workers and Soldiers knew in an oblique way that other Hives existed. But they had never seen or even heard of the other Hives until today. Liscor was far from their location, and the Antinium did not move between cities like other races.</p>
<p>“Why are they coming?”</p>
<p>“To see you. To greet my Queen and to see you. And appraise what value you have as Individuals.”</p>
<p>Klbkch never gave them detailed explanations. Pawn knew that was because he and the other Workers weren’t that important, but he <em>wished</em> the Antinium would trust them with more. He remembered Klbkch’s promise. If he made something out of the Soldiers, he would be told more.</p>
<p>“What should we do? What will the other Antinium ask of us?”</p>
<p>That came from Belgrade. He was probably the most worried, among the Workers, Pawn felt. Bird was usually calm, Garry was hard to ruffle, and Anand looked like he was actually enjoying this new development.</p>
<p>“Do not…worry.”</p>
<p>Klbkch said it as if he had to remember they could be worried.</p>
<p>“All you have to do is demonstrate your Skills. Questions will be asked—answer them to the best of your ability. It will not be difficult.”</p>
<p>He paused, looking the Workers over. Klbkch seemed to think, and then tapped the pommel of one of his swords slowly as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Some of the other Antinium may be…different. Unsettling. Odd, even. They are not Aberrations, rather they are created from a different template than we are. And the other Queens do not think as mine—ours does. Remember that.”</p>
<p>Pawn worried. What did that mean? Did they have Individuals of their own? But surely Klbkch would have mentioned that. He went on, looking at each of the Workers in turn as he gave them orders.</p>
<p>“Belgrade, Anand, and Bird will showcase their talents. Bird’s archery skills have much merit, as do Belgrade and Anand. They have the most value as [Tacticians] and as leaders of Soldiers. Garry will prepare meals to demonstrate his talents. Pawn—”</p>
<p>He glanced at the Worker. Pawn stood straight, holding his breathe, apprehensive.</p>
<p>“You will answer any questions directed to you if the others realize you are Individual as well. Do <em>not</em> volunteer information about your [Acolyte] class unless I address it specifically. That goes for all of you. Make no mention of that class, and not of Pawn either unless it is clear the others know about you.”</p>
<p>It felt like someone—Ryoka perhaps—had kicked Pawn in the stomach. He stood still, wrestling with his emotions.</p>
<p>Of course. He wasn’t that useful and his Skills still weren’t quantifiable. And from what Klbkch had said, his class pertained to Gods and Gods—</p>
<p>It still hurt. Even as Klbkch dismissed them and the Workers walked away to speak in an empty corridor in privacy, Pawn felt it hurting in his chest.</p>
<p>He wanted to be noticed. He wanted to be useful. But here—Pawn forced himself to listen to the conversation. It was the first time in a while he and the other Workers could talk, so they were all asking Garry what he had been doing in his new job.</p>
<p>The Worker nodded, folding his four hands together. He seemed slightly bigger than Pawn last remembered him—was he gaining weight? He still wore a slightly stained apron around his front, a piece of apparel that intrigued the other Workers greatly.</p>
<p>“I have been preparing meals for the Queen. I take monster parts and other edible foodstuffs and create food for her rather than the…paste…we are usually fed.”</p>
<p>The other Workers exchanged a glance, and then nodded their heads.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“This intrigues me.”</p>
<p>“Will you cook us such food?”</p>
<p>Garry nodded.</p>
<p>“If I am allowed. I believe Revalantor Klbkch wishes for me to cook for other members of the Hive, including himself. However, the Queen desires me to prepare food for her alone. I gather this is a source of contention between the two.”</p>
<p>That was fascinating. But Garry didn’t have details, so the other Workers quickly summarized what they had been doing. Belgrade and Anand had helped take down a Crypt Worm recently—Bird roamed the landscape, hunting animals with a bow and arrow. His life seemed exciting to Pawn, but the other Workers claimed he was actually the one with the most interest.</p>
<p>“I do not interact with any other species, Pawn. You are fortunate to talk with a Human on a daily basis.”</p>
<p>Anand and Belgrade nodded as Bird said this. Pawn couldn’t help staring at the feather hanging from a simple cord around Bird’s neck. It was a very red feather, and beautiful, too.</p>
<p>“I am envious. I have not been allowed to go to the surface.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. My duties keep me below at all times.”</p>
<p>“Does this Lyonette serve cooked birds?”</p>
<p>Pawn saw the keen interest in the other Worker’s eyes. He realized with a pang that they had never experienced what he had, and resolved to petition Klbkch to let them join him on a patrol. In the meantime, he could certainly bring some of what was above down below. He only regretted that the Soldiers had eaten all the cheese. If only he had his own quarters so he could store objects in them!</p>
<p>“The bees Lyon makes are very tasty. I shall bring you some, next time I go.”</p>
<p>“I believe Klbkch bought some for the Queen. I sampled one—the others have already been eaten. I shall attempt to replicate such treats for the rest of you and our guests.”</p>
<p>Just the thought of Garry’s cooking filled Pawn with hunger. He clicked his mandibles together sadly though, reflecting on his role.</p>
<p>“I regret that I cannot bring any value to the Hive. And that you must lie about my abilities.”</p>
<p>To Pawn’s surprise, Garry shook his head. He placed one of his hands on Pawn’s shoulders.</p>
<p>“Do not worry. You have value. In fact, it is I who envy you. You may not be of apparent worth to these Antinium who come, but you are special, even among us. One day, I believe your talents will surpass us all.”</p>
<p>Belgrade, Anand, and Bird all nodded.</p>
<p>“Agreed.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I will hunt birds to showcase my abilities.”</p>
<p>The other Workers looked at him. Bird shrugged.</p>
<p>“I like birds.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They were coming. At last, after all this time…the other Hives were coming. They were taking notice. Klbkch had to sit down after the other Workers had left. He tried to contain his excitement, but his hands shook slightly.</p>
<p>They were coming. And not just any lowly Workers or Soldiers, no. Klbkch knew this group had to include Prognugators, valuable members of each Hive, sent to observe and be their Queen’s eyes. They would observe him and he would see…see how much each Hive had changed since he had last travelled south.</p>
<p>All of that would have been dramatic enough, but Klbkch had participated in and suffered such gatherings before. The other Hives always sent spectators to witness another Hive’s achievement. But this time…</p>
<p>Klbkch tried to modulate his breathing. It was no good. His hand trembled as it touched his swords.</p>
<p>He had heard the report from the Listeners. They had heard the other Antinium approaching of course, and monitored them closely. But it was only this close to the city that some details had emerged, details which had shaken Klbkch down to his core.</p>
<p>It was about one of the Antinium who travelled with the others, one who stood out.. Klbkch looked at the report. He had written it down, circled the information after speaking with the Listeners. To be sure.</p>
<p>“An Antinium who casts magic?”</p>
<p>That was what the Listeners had heard. Explosions, thunderous sounds coming from her location. Spells, in short, unless the other Hives had managed to create a truly incredible variant in the few years since Klbkch had checked on them.</p>
<p>It had to be magic. And there was only one Antinium in the world who could cast spells. At least, only one Antinium among the living.</p>
<p>Klbkch sat in his chair. He held his silvery swords, stared blankly at a dirt wall. Only one Antinium, now. One that he had known since…since the day he had been created. So long ago.</p>
<p>The former Prognugator of the hive, the Revalantor named Klbkch, and the being who had once been one of the Centenium sat in the wooden chair. He stared back into the past.</p>
<p>And remembered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They came into the city as the sun was shining overhead. Not Antinium—a group of Drakes. They walked through the southern gates, talking with the guard, hoods covering any distinctive details like armor. Perhaps they would have entered quietly, but they were there to witness the monster attack.</p>
<p>It came out of the dungeon. The uncovered entrance to this new set of ruins was placed east of the city, at a good distance but close enough that the City Watch had posted a sizeable guard on the entrance.</p>
<p>Now this line of defense was under attack. The Drakes saw a band of Human adventurers fleeing the ruins, and behind them, shouts and screaming. Gnolls and Drakes fought desperately, the [Mage] among them shooting arrows of light into an oncoming crowd of—</p>
<p>“Children?”</p>
<p>That was what one of the Drakes in the group, a female adjunct whispered in horror. But these were no children who came pouring out of the hole in the ground, screaming, teeth bared.</p>
<p>“Scalelings.”</p>
<p>Wall Lord Ilvriss spat the words as Zel saw the line of guardsmen brace for impact. Arrows took down the horrible apparitions—shaped like children of Gnolls, Drakes, and Humans to lower their victim’s defenses—running at the [Guardsmen]. They normally preyed on people at night, he knew, where their monstrous details—their bright yellow, pupil less eyes and unnaturally long limbs for children were harder to pick out.</p>
<p>But the team of adventurers wearing poor-quality armor had upset their nest, and so it fell to the [Guardsmen] to stop them from attacking the adventurers and travelers on the road. They shouted as they hit the first wave, the small Scalelings—or Children as they were known in Human lands—pushing back the [Guardsmen] with terrible strength and ferocity.</p>
<p>“They’re going to be overwhelmed.”</p>
<p>Ilvriss said this calmly, a hand on his sword as the guards at the gate of Liscor sounded the alarm. There were [Archers] on the walls of course, but the battle was too thick for all but the best to shoot into.</p>
<p>“Should we cut a path for them to retreat to the walls, do you think, Shivertail?”</p>
<p>“No. Allow me.”</p>
<p>So saying, Zel pointed at the [Guardsmen]. He spoke two words.</p>
<p>“[Shield Wall].”</p>
<p>The [Guardsmen] had been faltering, falling back. But as Zel said the words, their actions changed. They stood taller, and when the snarling Scalelings rammed into them, it was the monsters who fell back. Suddenly, each Drake and Gnoll was rooted in place and they forced the horrific creatures back one step at a time.</p>
<p>“Reinforcements.”</p>
<p>Ilvriss commented as more [Guardsmen]—[Guardspeople], really—rushed out the gate. For how quickly the engagement had started, their response was quite fast.</p>
<p>“And there’s the local [Tactician] I think. We can move on.”</p>
<p>“Mm. Yes.”</p>
<p>Zel nodded, seeing the battle was contained. He, Ilvriss, and the group the Wall Lord had brought with him walked further into the city.</p>
<p>“I’m not staying at the same inn as you, Shivertail. You can find whatever run down hovel you want, but I’ll be staying at the Tailless Thief. It’s the best inn in the city and I know the owner.”</p>
<p>“Fine by me.”</p>
<p>Zel didn’t rise to the bait. He looked around the city, noting all the Human adventurers who were gathered at the gates, watching the fighting.</p>
<p>“Lots of adventurers around. You might not find a room.”</p>
<p>Ilvriss just scowled at him.</p>
<p>“The innkeeper will make room. I am a Lord of the Wall.”</p>
<p>“Good for you.”</p>
<p>Zel would be glad enough to leave Ilvriss to his own devices—at least for a day. His feet hurt. He walked on through the city. Time enough to find an inn for himself later. Right now he had to announce himself to the Council with Ilvriss. The wretched Drake demanded such formailities.</p>
<p>So Zel Shivertail entered Liscor. And his arrival was unnoticed by many pedestrians, but the [Guardsmen] certainly noticed and word instantly spread to the Watch Captain of the incident. And one other person in the city noticed as well.</p>
<p>Selys looked up from her desk in the Adventurer’s Guild, cutting off her conversation with a wet and unhappy Gnoll. She suddenly felt lighter, and more refreshed, as if someone had given her a hot mug of tea. She made a fist with one claw, and then looked out the window with a smile. Only one person always included her in his radius of command.</p>
<p>“Oh. Uncle Zel’s visiting the city!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Klbkch met the other Antinium outside of the city, in secret. He came alone, and nodded his head respectfully as the other Antinium stood, letting snow fall off of their bodies to greet him.</p>
<p>They were a little less than twenty in all. Klbkch noted each one as they introduced themselves. Four Hives had come. Four Hives had sent their best. The absence of the fifth troubled him, but—</p>
<p>“Prognugator Klbkch. I greet you as a fellow Prognugator. I am Tersk of the Armored Antinium.”</p>
<p>The first to make a move was a big Antinium with a form reminiscent of a Soldier. But he had only two arms instead of four, and his hands were proper ones. He was also wearing armor. Klbkch stared at the steel plate armor that covered his entire body and noted the specially-tailored metal plates that had been carefully crafted into a helmet. He nodded to the armored giant.</p>
<p>“I greet you Tersk. Although I am no longer a Prognugator but a Revalantor I will perform the duties of both while you are here. I see you have brought others of your hive.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The Prognugator said it simply. He indicated three other Antinium, all as tall as he was, all wearing armor. Klbkch noted that all of the Armored Antinium had weapons. A shield and mace in Tersk’s case—swords and a spear for the others.</p>
<p>“Allow me to extend my apologies for my error in your position.”</p>
<p>“The error is mine. I did not mention this detail to begin with.”</p>
<p>Klbkch and Tersk lowered their heads. That done, the Prognugator stepped back and another one came forwards.</p>
<p>“Revalantor Klbkch. I am Revalantor Pivr. I observe that your form has changed from the standard template assigned to this Hive. Has your Queen been creating variations of the Worker and Soldier form without authorization?”</p>
<p>This came from an Antinium smaller than Tersk, but no less striking. Jade-colored wings fanned outwards from the Antinium, and Klbkch saw not two but four sets of eyes on his head. Even his body was hunched, all the better for his two arms to use the twin daggers at his side. He also had poisonous spit Klbkch knew—the odor was unmistakable on the Antinium’s breath.</p>
<p>And he annoyed Klbkch. The Revalantor stared Pivr in the eyes, and spoke calmly.</p>
<p>“My form is unique to me, as befitting my status. I greet you, Pivr. Who have you brought to my Hive?”</p>
<p>Pivr turned, fanning his twin sets of wings out to show them off, Klbkch was sure.</p>
<p>“Six of my Queen’s warriors—five regular warriors and a heavy-combat variant have flown here to see what your Hive has wrought. We are the Flying Antinium. Witness us.”</p>
<p>Klbkch did see, and part of him was impressed. Five of the warriors did look like Pivr, but the last was a larger variant. Thick carapace plates obscured his body, giving him more the appearance of a walking tank. But he had wings as well, huge ones, and even a horn like a beetle with sharp prongs.</p>
<p>Yes, part of Klbkch was impressed. The other part was not. But he kept his words within and simply nodded to Pivr.</p>
<p>“I greet you.”</p>
<p>The other Revalantor hesitated, opening his mandibles as if he wanted to say something. But then Klbkch was walking forwards towards the last unique Antinium in the group. He felt like he was in a dream, but when he stopped in front of the slim, short Antinium with blue carapace who held a staff in one of her two hands, she was real.</p>
<p>So very real.</p>
<p>“Xrn.”</p>
<p>It was all Klbkch could say. The other Antinium—no Worker, no Soldier, but graceful and unique, her body different from any other—opened her mandibles to smile at him. Her eyes shone with a thousand colors, flickering with the mystery of magic. And her voice was soft, deep, commanding.</p>
<p>“Klbkch. It has been too long.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Far too long.”</p>
<p>It was all Klbkch could say, as if he had been transformed into one of the birds that spoke, a parrot. Xrn smiled again. Klbkch didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>“How—how did you come here? I would have never thought the Grand Queen would allow…”</p>
<p>“I had to persuade her of course. But I thought it worthwhile to see you.”</p>
<p>Xrn said it simply. She nodded to the Soldiers and Workers behind her, and only now did Klbkch realize he was neglecting his duties.</p>
<p>“Pardon me. I greet you, Xrn, Prognugator of the Grand Hive. Who are the Antinium who come with you?”</p>
<p>“Two Hives. Mine, and that of the Silent Antinium.”</p>
<p>She pointed, and Klbkch saw. There were two groups standing behind Xrn, eight Antinium in total. Two were still as shadows, hunched, almost invisible even in the snow. Their carapaces had changed to become whiter, more translucent, and their arms were more like scything blades. Their mandibles were likewise made to tear out an opponent’s throat and they were perhaps the slimmest of all Antinium save for Xrn.</p>
<p>“The assassin breed. Have they no leader?”</p>
<p>“Their Queen declined to send one. And with me—six of the Grand Queen’s soldiers, my escort.”</p>
<p>These Antinium were by far the most conventional, but even then…Klbkch saw two were classic Soldiers, but with carapaces so heavily reinforced that they stood two feet taller than a regular Soldier, to carry all the weight. They were taller even than the Armored Antinium, while the other four—</p>
<p>Klbkch inhaled sharply. Xrn nodded.</p>
<p>“They are like me.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the four Antinium closely resembled Klbkch’s current form. They were slim and had two hands, and at their sides they had blades. Not silver metal like his, but rather blades made of a dark substance, the same as those the scythes of the Silent Antinium were made of. These Antinium were also different from the rest in that they studied Klbkch with attentiveness. Intelligence.</p>
<p>“Natural blades. These are not Prognugators but Custodium—think of them as partial Prognugators.”</p>
<p>“Made in the same way?”</p>
<p>Xrn’s mandibles opened, and her tone was mocking.</p>
<p>“Yes. There are forty in the Hive.”</p>
<p>The number left Klbkch speechless. The sheer extravagance and waste it took to create—he would have asked Xrn more, but then Pivr interrupted.</p>
<p>“Revalantor Klbkch, are the introductions done? If so, I have a pressing announcement to inform you of.”</p>
<p>Klbkch and Xrn stared at him. They were all Prognugators and Revalantor, true, including&nbsp; Tersk, but Xrn and Klbkch were different. Tersk clearly knew that and respectfully stayed quiet, but Pivr was clearly different.</p>
<p>Xrn was the first to speak. Her tone was sharp.</p>
<p>“I am talking with Klbkch. You will be silent, Pivr.”</p>
<p>“You have been given command of our group, yes. But my Queen—”</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>Xrn turned back to Klbkch and only now did he remember the…personality of his old companion. He had forgotten it, living for so long in his quiet Hive.</p>
<p>“We have much to discuss. After we greet your Queen, you and I must have time to talk.”</p>
<p>“You are not expected to return soon?”</p>
<p>“No. In fact, I told my Queen I would be a long time in returning.”</p>
<p>“You told the Grand Queen that?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>That was Xrn. Klbkch shifted his glance to the Antinium and once again noted the absence of the fifth Hive.</p>
<p>“Wrymvr did not come? And his Queen sent no one?”</p>
<p>Xrn shrugged.</p>
<p>“You know him.”</p>
<p>“I do. I should not be surprised. In truth, I did not expect your presence either.”</p>
<p>“Yes, well—”</p>
<p>“I have an announcement.”</p>
<p>This time Klbkch had to restrain himself from stabbing Pivr. But the Revalantor had strode into the center of the Antinium. He spoke loudly, without glancing at Xrn whose look was…murderous.</p>
<p>“My instructions were to obey Prognugator Xrn until we reached the city of Liscor. However, here I and the Flying Antinium will carry out different orders. We will go into the city via the main gates.”</p>
<p>“<em>What?</em>”</p>
<p>Klbkch couldn’t believe his ears. Pivr nodded at him calmly.</p>
<p>“I was not informed of this.”</p>
<p>Xrn’s voice was foreboding, but Pivr didn’t seem intimidated.</p>
<p>“Your input was not required. My Queen has given her orders, and they will be obeyed.”</p>
<p>“You cannot enter the city. I forbid it.”</p>
<p>Klbkch had no idea how the [Guardsmen] would react upon seeing these Antinium. They would likely think the Second Antinium Wars were upon them again. Even in the best case—</p>
<p>But Pivr could not be argued with.</p>
<p>“These are my Queen’s orders. You, Xrn, have no authority over this. We will go into the city. We will not fight even if provoked, but we will maintain a show of force. You are allowed to follow us if you so desire. Indeed, Revalantor Klbkch’s presence would greatly be appreciated.”</p>
<p>With that, he and the other six Antinium began to march through the snow. They accelerated—then their wings opened and they <em>flew.</em></p>
<p>Not into the air, but across the ground, skipping across the ground. It wasn’t true flight—but it was too fast to catch up to on foot. Klbkch didn’t waste time talking to Xrn. She couldn’t stop them. If she cast a spell the Flying Antinium would fight it, and if she bound them they would just wait to be free. They would fulfill their orders or die.</p>
<p>The Antinium flew towards the city, and soon Klbkch heard the shouting from the walls. He only prayed there wouldn’t be any fighting. So long as the [Guardsmen] kept their cool they would realize these were Antinium. And the citizens of Liscor had grown used to the Antinium. It could be okay. It might be okay.</p>
<p>Then he saw the two Drakes standing in the middle of the street. Pivr had stopped with his six Antinium, uncertain. Drakes and Gnolls and Humans were fleeing him, but these two Drakes—and the group of warriors standing behind them—were not.</p>
<p>Klbkch could sense they were no ordinary warriors. Their presence alone had warned Pivr not to approach carelessly. Klbkch looked at them, about to call out, defuse whatever misunderstanding that might have occurred. And then he recognized one of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zel Shivertail had been prepared for the Antinium. He knew they were in the city so he had been prepared to grit his teeth if he saw one on the street. But the flying Antinium? They’d come out of nowhere, speeding down the street. Was it an attack? His pulse had been racing and he had had to hold Ilvris back, prevent him from unsheathing his sword and attacking.</p>
<p>But now another Antinium had come, one armed with two swords. Zel saw them, and his heart stopped in his chest.</p>
<p>Ilvriss froze by his side. His voice was the only sound in the street, the only sound Zel could hear over the hammering in his chest.</p>
<p>“Those <em>swords.</em> It can’t be—”</p>
<p>Another Antinium raced into the city, and behind her, more Antinium. Armored warriors—huge giants! The Drake warriors behind Ilvriss grabbed at their weapons.</p>
<p>“Those are specialist Antinium! From the Hives in the south!”</p>
<p>“An attack!?”</p>
<p>“Guard the Wall Lord!”</p>
<p>“Hold—hold!”</p>
<p>Zel ground the words out, but he felt like he’d been stabbed. Ilvriss had gone pale at the sight of the other Antinium who stood by the one with swords. His voice was a whisper now.</p>
<p>“Azure. The color of the sky.”</p>
<p>There was only one Antinium like that, Zel knew. But his eyes were still on the one with swords. There was only one Antinium like that one, as well.</p>
<p>“Klbkch the Slayer.”</p>
<p>His voice was thunder in his ears as he let go of Ilvriss. The Wall Lord had a death-grip on his sword as he stared at the Antinium holding the staff.</p>
<p>“The Small Queen. Xrn.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Across the street, Klbkch stood frozen. Memory surged around him at the sight of Zel Shivertail’s face. It had caught Xrn as well.</p>
<p>“Zel Shivertail. And a Lord of the Wall.”</p>
<p>The air had changed. Pivr glanced uncertainly at Klbkch and Xrn.</p>
<p>“Who are these Drakes?”</p>
<p>No one answered him. Klbkch’s hands were on his sword. He felt Xrn trembling next to him.</p>
<p>“We must not fight.”</p>
<p>He said it, but the words were distant in his head. He couldn’t retreat. Not here. Not now.</p>
<p>Someone took a step forwards. Was it him? The Drakes started to advance as well. Shivertail’s eyes were locked on Klbkch’s.</p>
<p>Memory flashed between the two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Zel Shivertail killed another Soldier, cutting apart his carapace with claws like razors. He turned, and saw the battlefield had disintegrated into chaos. Drakes and Antinium struggled everywhere, the Antinium fighting and killing anything moving.</em></p>
<p><em>Chaos. He turned and blocked a sword that came for his neck at the last moment. The Antinium who leapt backwards was slim, and covered in blood. Drake blood. He held his swords like a true blade master, watching Zel carefully.</em></p>
<p><em>“Zel Shivertail.”</em></p>
<p><em>“You must be Klbkch the Slayer.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes. I have come to kill you. If you die, the Antinium will triumph here.”</em></p>
<p><em>Zel pointed at the battlefield, where Antinium fought and died, killing mindlessly even as the Drakes organized and began to slaughter them.</em></p>
<p><em>“Is this how the Antinium do battle?”</em></p>
<p><em>“It is how we fight to survive, Drake. When we do battle, you will know the difference.”</em></p>
<p><em>Klbkch leapt forwards and then there were only his flashing blades. Zel snarled, slashing with his claws—</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’ll take the mage. You take the Slayer.”</p>
<p>“We are not…here to fight.”</p>
<p>Zel rasped the words out. His feet dragged themselves forwards though, and he couldn’t muster the effort to stop them. He and Ilvriss advanced down the street, ignoring the calls from the Drakes behind them to stop.</p>
<p>Ilvriss felt one of his guards grab at him and swung one fist. The Drake fell back, bleeding, and the Lord of the Wall walked forwards as if in a trance. His sword was in his hand, and his eyes were on Xrn’s. They stared at each other, as they had done years ago on the battlefield.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>He stood with the [Mages] and [Strategists], coordinating the battle as the Drake and Human forces contained the Antinium with walls of steel and blasted them with magic.&nbsp; Ilvriss stood patiently, knowing his chance for battle would not come. But then the earth exploded and he saw her standing amid the destruction.</em></p>
<p><em>The command tent burned as she drew a line of fire that burned the Human [Commander] to ash. Out of the billowing smoke, Soldiers charged into battle, fighting the unprepared [Mages] and support classes and their small retinue of guards.</em></p>
<p><em>“This battle is over. Flee, Drakes and Humans, or I will slay you all.”</em></p>
<p><em>That came from the Antinium who glowed with magic. She looked down at Ilvriss as he stood, shaking, blood running down his right leg, his long sword in hand.</em></p>
<p><em>“Name yourself! Who are you?”</em></p>
<p><em>He roared at her as he charged, cutting Soldiers down. The Antinium’s voice echoed as she stood on a rock, casting spells left and right, cutting down his allies, his friends.</em></p>
<p><em>“I am the last memory of my kind. Thunder which moves grass. I am a Queen without a Hive. Fire burning in the heart of ice. I am Xrn, and I will not die here.”</em></p>
<p><em>She raised her staff, and lightning split the sky. It broke the formations of Drakes, and a fireball fell among the [Mages] who hadn’t time to raise a shield spell. They burned, dying, and the Antinium with a staff raised hers high. The wind blew, and the Soldiers and Workers charged. Ilvriss fell back, fighting among the dying….</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He couldn’t stop. Zel walked onwards, and so did the Antinium. The streets were empty.</p>
<p>The air was screaming with tension.</p>
<p>He knew he should stop. They were at peace.</p>
<p>Peace? With the Antinium? Zel walked the battlefield and saw his foes only a few feet away. He could smell the dead around him, and feel blood running down his side. The air was hot. Hot? It was the middle of summer, and the Antinium—</p>
<p>Zel felt snow crunching under his feet. He knew he was in Liscor, knew the war was over. But the pounding pulse in his head wouldn’t die down. And the Antinium were right in front of him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Klbkch’s feet moved. His swords were in his hands.</p>
<p>“We must stop.”</p>
<p>Xrn said that, dreamily. But he could feel magic gathering around her. Klbkch said nothing.</p>
<p>He couldn’t stop.</p>
<p>“Fighting is prohibited.”</p>
<p>Klbkch’s head turned and Pivr quailed. He knew the other Antinium was right. But nothing could stop him. He was staring Zel Shivertail in the eye, and he knew it was time to finish things. The sword was cold in Klbkch’s hand. He took another step, another—</p>
<p>And then someone rushed in front of him, arms spread wide. Klbkch raised his sword to cut the person—the Antinium down—</p>
<p>“Pawn!”</p>
<p>The blade stopped. Pawn stood in front of Klbkch, arms spread wide, and twenty Soldiers stood at his back. Xrn had paused too, surprised by the other Antinium’s appearance.</p>
<p>“Revalantor Klbkch, I regret that we must bar your way.”</p>
<p>Klbkch opened his mandibles to protest, to tell Pawn to <em>move</em> before Zel Shivertail cut him down from behind—when he saw the shouting on the other end of the street.</p>
<p>“Guardsmen! Form a line!”</p>
<p>Watch Captain Zevara—<em>Zevara</em> was there, forming a living wall like Pawn had with Gnolls and Drakes. They blocked off Zel and the Wall Lord from advancing, faces grim, shields raised as if they expected a fight.</p>
<p>The Drake [General] was staring at Watch Captain Zevara as she shouted at them to back up. Klbkch heard another voice then as well, a familiar one.</p>
<p>“Hey, old man Zel! It’s me, Relc! How’s it going? And who’s this guy?”</p>
<p>A big Drake waved excitedly at the head of the tense group of [Guardsmen]. Relc was enough of a distraction by himself. Klbkch felt the madness—the memory holding him loosen. He turned.</p>
<p>“Xrn.”</p>
<p>“I know. Let’s get out of here.”</p>
<p>She turned. The Antinium—the Armored Antinium, Pivr and his band of idiots, and the silent assassins and Xrn’s honor guard ran through the streets. The City Watch and the Drake [General] let them go. And in a few moments…</p>
<p>There was peace.</p>
<p>For now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They had come close to war. Perhaps. Zel could only shudder at the thought as he walked out of Liscor’s gates. If they had fought, regardless of who had lived and died, what would have happened? Would it have been war right then? Would the Queen have done that?</p>
<p>If Ilvriss or he had died—Zel didn’t want to imagine it. His earholes still rang from Watch Captain Zevara’s shouting. It had been a miracle she’d gotten there in time.</p>
<p>He should have known better. Zel knew that. But he had seen Klbkch and memory—</p>
<p>He’d think on it later. It was late, after all the shouting and then the explanations and introductions had been done. Zel glanced at the sky and wanted nothing more than to find somewhere comfortable to sleep.</p>
<p>But all the inns were full, and he had no desire to stay under the same roof as Ilvriss. So Zel walked out of the city and towards a place he thought he remembered.</p>
<p>It was odd. The inn seemed closer than it should have been, and in the wrong place. But it was the only inn around, and so Zel knocked politely on the door and waited.</p>
<p>When it did open, he stared down in mild surprise at the girl who stared up at him with huge eyes. A young Gnoll cub appeared behind the girl and then darted away as Zel waited for her to speak.</p>
<p>“Um. Hello.”</p>
<p>“Good evening, Miss. Is the [Innkeeper] here by any chance?”</p>
<p>“Erin? No she’s…I’m sorry, please, come in!”</p>
<p>Zel entered, somewhat mystified. Erin? That was a female name, or so he thought. What had happened to the man? Had he retired?</p>
<p>Perhaps he’d gotten married and this was his daughter. Or just a [Barmaid]. Zel sat at a table, smiling without showing his teeth as the girl brought him a drink.</p>
<p>“Here’s some water. Honey water, actually.”</p>
<p>Zel’s nonexistent eyebrows rose as he sipped at the sweet drink. It was quite nice, and pleasantly hot.</p>
<p>“So the [Innkeeper] is gone? Will she be back tonight, do you know?”</p>
<p>“No I—she’s been gone for a while now. I run the inn while she’s—away. My name is Lyon. Lyonette.”</p>
<p>Odder and odder. But Zel still needed a place to sleep.</p>
<p>“In that case, may I ask if your inn is full Miss Lyon? I’m looking for lodgings and all of the inns in the city are crowded.”</p>
<p>“A place to—?”</p>
<p>The girl’s eyes widened as if she was surprised he wanted to stay here. And judging from the way the inn was so empty at dinnertime, that was probably justified. But Zel liked the feel of the inn. It had glass windows, flowers, and a lovely fire.</p>
<p>“If you wouldn’t mind, I’d like a room. I stayed here once before—I think it was here—a long time ago and I have fond memories of this place.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Well this inn was rebuilt…”</p>
<p>Zel blinked at Lyon. The girl blushed.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. It’s a long story. But yes—we have plenty of rooms. If you’d like to stay here, I can offer you a very reasonable rate. But I’m afraid Erin—the [Innkeeper] is gone so I’m the only one who can serve you. I’ll do my best, but I’m not the best cook.”</p>
<p>“Well, as long as it’s edible I will be quite happy.”</p>
<p>Zel smiled reassuringly at Lyon, and she managed to smile back. He looked down as he felt a wet nose on his leg.</p>
<p>“And I see you’re not all by yourself. Who’s this?”</p>
<p>“Mrsha!”</p>
<p>The Human girl yelped and chased away the Gnoll. But she paused as Zel laughed, and smiled again.</p>
<p>“If you’re willing…then welcome. As I said, my name is Lyonette. This is Mrsha. Welcome…to the Wandering Inn.”</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When the Horns of Hammerad left the city of Remendia, it was, predictably, to a huge fanfare and celebration by the crowds lining the street. At this point, the four adventurers so highly lauded were well and truly sick of the entire affair.</p>
<p>“It’s not even as if there’s anything to cheer about. We’re <em>leaving.</em>”</p>
<p>Yvlon and Pisces nodded in dour agreement as they strode down the streets towards the gates. Ksmvr didn’t reply—he was busy waving. He seemed to enjoy it.</p>
<p>“There’s the wagon. Let’s get on.”</p>
<p>Ceria pointed, and the Horns of Hammerad piled onto the wagon outside of the city. The cheering faded a bit as the crowds realized that the illustrious adventurers, the heroes who’d conquered Albez, weren’t leaving on white stallions or riding away in a carriage.</p>
<p>They were taking a wagon, for good and practical reasons. But it was definitely less fancy and so the adventurers left the city with their eardrums mostly intact.</p>
<p>“Thanks for waiting. Are you headed directly to Celum?”</p>
<p>Ceria addressed the wagon driver, a woman who grinned at her as she flicked her reins to make the two horses begin plodding down the road.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I’ve got a bulk delivery of goods—crops, meat, and so on—that needs to get down there tonight.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Are you part of the Runner’s Guild?”</p>
<p>The woman clearly was no Runner, but the Guild sometimes hired slower modes of transport to deliver goods the old-fashioned way when there weren’t enough Runners or there was too much to carry. The wagon driver snorted gently.</p>
<p>“No—Merchant’s Guild. We handle all the mundane traffic. You’ll never see a Runner stoop to carrying this stuff. Of course, up north the damn Runner’s Guilds have bags of holding and so their Runners can still beat our prices. But this close to the south us [Merchants] and [Traders] have the monopoly on transport.”</p>
<p>The half-Elf nodded. It wasn’t like she’d asked for an explanation, but guild rivalries were a touchy thing. And the Runner’s Guild wasn’t exactly popular—adventurers had their issues with them, as did [Merchants] and other groups like the Mage’s Guild and so on.</p>
<p>“Well, so long as we get to Celum before dark, we’ll be happy.”</p>
<p>“No fear of that. Truth be told, I wouldn’t be doing this run at all if you lot hadn’t decided to hitch a ride. All these Goblin attacks make it far too dangerous—but the Horns of Hammerad shouldn’t have any problems, right?”</p>
<p>Ceria could only smile crookedly at that.</p>
<p>“Hopefully we don’t see an army.”</p>
<p>So saying, she retreated back to the mostly-filled wagon. Pisces was sitting atop a bag of what was probably potatoes, Yvlon had made herself comfortable on some boxes that she wouldn’t squish, and Ksmvr was sitting with his legs dangling off the back of the wagon. Ceria joined Yvlon on the boxes.</p>
<p>For a while there was silence. The Horns of Hammerad were tired, if not physically so early in the day, then mentally. After a while though, Pisces felt compelled to break the silence. As always.</p>
<p>“What I fail to understand is why those fo—those confused denizens of Remendia—felt the need to cheer our departure. To what end? We are leaving, not arriving in splendor and triumph.”</p>
<p>Ceria sighed. But it was Yvlon who replied. She frowned vaguely at Pisces, but had no real rancor in her tone. She and Pisces might be fairly incompatible, but they were teammates now.</p>
<p>“We’re heroes to them, Pisces. Don’t tell me you’ve never dreamed of seeing a team of adventurers as a child? They wanted to give us a sendoff worthy of the heroes they thought we were. I’m almost ashamed that we disappointed their expectations.”</p>
<p>Pisces sniffed, but made no comment. Ceria just shrugged as she made herself more comfortable on her seat. She drew the wool cloak around her body closer to herself, shivering at the cold winter winds.</p>
<p>“At some point they’ve got to realize that even heroes are practical. Besides, it’s not as if we could afford a carriage or mounts. Not that Ksmvr would be able to ride a horse.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr looked up from his study of the landscape and nodded.</p>
<p>“That is correct. Thank you for noticing, Captain Ceria.”</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it.”</p>
<p>Pisces rolled his eyes and smirked, but Yvlon treated him to a disapproving glance and he swallowed the comment he was about to make. Instead he looked back towards the city, already growing distant as the wagon pulled itself down the road at a good pace. The driver might have had a Skill that allowed the horses to move faster, Ceria reflected.</p>
<p>“I wonder, would all those cheering people believe that we are destitute?”</p>
<p>Yvlon looked blank.</p>
<p>“Destitute?”</p>
<p>“Broke.”</p>
<p>Ceria sighed. Pieces could have used a simpler word, but then he wouldn’t be Pisces.</p>
<p>“I doubt it. After all that coin we received, who’d believe that? But if we hadn’t gotten this deal to guard the wagon in exchange for transport, we’d be walking right now.”</p>
<p>That made everyone go silent for a moment. Yvlon just sighed, and stared down at her arms. She wasn’t wearing her plate armor—it had been too badly damaged to save and they hadn’t had enough coin to buy more. Instead, she was wearing leather, except along her arms which were still fused with the silvery metal.</p>
<p>“Do you think we gave Ryoka too much coin?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps.”</p>
<p>Ceria stared at the snowy landscape as they passed by. In the distance, she saw a village filled with a few moving shapes.</p>
<p>“There’s no such thing as too much gold when it comes to paying [Mages]. She’ll need a lot to get accurate, speedy work done.”</p>
<p>“And we should have had enough to live comfortably if it weren’t for those extortionate fees.”</p>
<p>Pisces put that in with a scowl. Yvlon looked unhappy as well.</p>
<p>“I know. We should have considered that, but neither Ceria nor I had ever heard of the Guild’s taxes until this point.”</p>
<p>That was true. Ceria had been just as surprised as the others when they’d found out that the Adventurer’s Guild demanded a ten percent cut of the spoils gained from a dungeon raid or a particularly lucrative assignment. It did seem like extortion in a way—the Guild already took a chunk out of every assignment they offered and made money from referring adventurers and selling their own products.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, membership in the Adventurer’s Guild was free, and they did provide other services. So the Horns of Hammerad had reluctantly paid the steep fees, choosing to pay more coin rather than report the value of the artifacts they’d recovered and have that factored into the fee.</p>
<p>Still, it smarted and took a lot out of their hard-won savings of coin. And when they added the fees for hiring the [Blacksmith] and [Healer] to remove the metal from Yvlon’s arm—not to mention the price of staying in the inn and eating so lavishly for the few days they’d been in the city—well, that was how the Horns of Hammerad found themselves back to square one.</p>
<p>Which was to say, broke. They had a few silver coins left, but all of their remaining coin and the valuable artifacts they’d found were with Ryoka, in the north.</p>
<p>Did Ceria regret gambling everything on her friend? A little bit, she had to admit. Still…</p>
<p>“Ryoka will get back to us soon, and she’ll contact us when she’s done with Lady Magnolia. She might be appraising our artifacts as we speak.”</p>
<p>Yvlon looked slightly doubtful.</p>
<p>“If you say so. You know her best, Ceria. I only met her once before. She seemed honorable—but hotheaded. Are you sure she won’t waste the coin or…make a mistake with it?”</p>
<p>Pisces and Ksmvr turned to look at Ceria as well. She blinked, realizing that none of the other adventurers in her group knew Ryoka that well, even Pisces. True, he’d healed her legs, but he didn’t know her any better than the others.</p>
<p>“She is. Hotheaded, I mean. She’s prickly and arrogant and she’s not exactly easy to deal with all of the time. But she is brave, Yvlon. She went into the crypts to rescue me and she’s certainly no coward. We can trust her. Calruz did, and you know he wouldn’t trust anyone who wasn’t totally honorable. Actually…Ryoka’s a lot like a female Calruz.”</p>
<p>Yvlon snorted at that, but Pisces and Ksmvr just exchanged a confused glance. Ceria’s heart twinged as she realized…neither of them knew who Calruz was, either. Pisces probably didn’t even recognize the Minotaur’s name.</p>
<p>“Well, we’ll wait for her then. She’s a friend of Erin Solstice, so I suppose I shall place my trust in her capabilities.”</p>
<p>That was Pisces’ conclusion. He sat back on his bag of potatoes and shifted around for a moment. Then he looked at Ceria.</p>
<p>“On the topic of spoils however, I wonder. If you’re not planning on doing any studying, why not lend me that spellbook, Springwalker? I’d only borrow it for the duration of the journey…”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Ceria paused as she opened her pack. She pulled out the spellbook, the burnt half of a spellbook rather, and opened it carefully to the first page. It was her greatest treasure, now, far more important than anything else she’d ever owned. Yvlon rolled her eyes and Ksmvr scooped up some snow as the argument between the two [Mages] resumed.</p>
<p>“Oh come now. I won’t need it for long—and you get sick when reading while in motion. Let me see it.”</p>
<p>“My spellbook, Pisces. That was the deal.”</p>
<p>He scowled at her.</p>
<p>“But that—I only meant—”</p>
<p>“I get the first spellbook we find, in exchange for the ring. You agreed, and so this is mine. Deal with it.”</p>
<p>Ceria stared down at the page filled with glowing words and symbols. She had no idea what it meant—like most high-level magical spellbooks, this one was written in a combination of regular text and magical formulas. However, the words that were meant to describe a spell’s use and other details were written in a language Ceria didn’t know. She could only try and decipher the magical instructions, which were written in a universal language for [Mages].</p>
<p>The trouble was…Ceria wasn’t certain what tier the spell she was staring at was, but it was certainly far above her capabilities. So were all the spells in the book—the mage had obviously been extraordinarily high-level, and so the spells were the most complex Ceria had ever seen. She wasn’t even certain of whether she was on the first page of the spell or midway through—that was how hard it was to understand.</p>
<p>“But this is completely unfair. If you compare such a trove of magical knowledge to the paltry ring—surely you understand my position. Springwalker, I implore you. We could study it together. Surely two minds are better than—”</p>
<p>Pisces stopped whining and ducked as Ceria pointed her skeletal finger. A snowball coalesced out of the air and shot past his ear. He sat up and Ceria kept reading.</p>
<p>That was the Horns of Hammerad. They sat on the wagon, Pisces sulking, Ceria reading, frowning and chewing at her hair, Yvlon staring at the landscape and Ksmvr playing with the snow.</p>
<p>They had gone into Albez and made their way through a trapped dungeon. True, they’d nearly died and lost a lot of the treasure to the final trap, but they’d survived. And now they were…</p>
<p>What? Ceria frowned as she tried to concentrate on the spell. Were they better than they had been? They were teammates, now, that was certain. They’d faced death once, and so they were a stronger group.</p>
<p>But was that all? They’d actually lost a lot of combat strength, she felt. Yvlon was injured. She could still wield a sword, albeit with some stiffness, but her armor was gone and her arms would need a master-class [Healer] to fix. Or a spell, neither of which the Horns of Hammerad could afford.</p>
<p>They had a spellbook, but Ceria couldn’t make heads or tails of it for the moment and she doubted that Pisces, genius though he was, would have better luck. Ryoka had their hard-won artifacts, and while they might turn out to be earth-shatteringly powerful, and while Ceria would eventually learn all the spells in the spellbook, it was all deferred rewards. Right here and now, they were no better than they had been. Worse, in fact.</p>
<p>And that was concerning for one reason. Ceria put down the book of spells, making Pisces look up, and voiced her concerns to her team.</p>
<p>“I know we agreed to escort Erin back to Liscor. But are we sure that’s wise at the moment?”</p>
<p>The other three Horns of Hammerad looked up. None of them needed an explanation. Yvlon frowned as she ran her fingers across the smooth metal in her arms—the [Blacksmith] had helped sand the rough edges of the metal after she had cut most of it away, but it still had to be uncomfortable, especially in the cold.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Honestly, I wouldn’t worry normally. We’re more than capable of taking on any normal group of bandits or monsters, but all the rumors of Goblin armies we’ve been hearing recently have me worried.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr nodded.</p>
<p>“If the reports of a Goblin Lord are true, we should be cautious. Even raiding parties sent out from such a force would number in the hundreds.”</p>
<p>Ceria grimaced.</p>
<p>“I doubt Erin’s in danger in Celum, at least if the Goblin Lord’s main army isn’t there. Every city has enchantments on their walls and they can normally hold out for a while. I just don’t understand how Esthelm fell in a day. That makes no sense.”</p>
<p>Pisces just shrugged. He seemed less concerned than the others by the countless stories they’d heard of Goblins attacking villages and even towns and cities.</p>
<p>“Goblin Lords are notoriously powerful. If one is truly present—and I cast aspersions on the rumors of his existence—then he could well have overwhelmed the city’s defenses with a sneak attack. Either way, his army is not a concern—word will spread when it marches. Rather, we should be worrying about Goblin war bands, as Ksmvr has said.”</p>
<p>Yvlon nodded seriously.</p>
<p>“We might be able to escape or fend them off if we encounter them on the road—but that depends on how many spells you and Pisces know. Ksmvr and I can’t fight a horde like that. But what worries me is Erin herself. Would we then be taking her into danger, bringing her to Liscor, closer to where the Goblin Lord might be?”</p>
<p>Ksmvr nodded, but Pisces just smirked and Ceria had to laugh at the irony of the question.</p>
<p>“Liscor? Hah. It’s safer than Celum, Yvlon. Erin’s close enough that she could run into the city if a Goblin force came calling. And as for them getting past Liscor’s walls…not a chance. That city’s famous from the Antinium Wars—it’s withstood sieges from the Antinium and a [Necromancer] far more capable than Pisces.”</p>
<p>“I object. That statement is fundamentally correct, but flawed in its assumptions. I—”</p>
<p>“Shut up, Pisces. The walls of Liscor are high, and they’ve got far more powerful enchantments on them. So long as they actually close the gates, they’ll hold out during a siege for months at least. And there’s two Gold-rank teams in the city. With them on the walls, even a Goblin Lord would think twice before assailing the city.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr and Yvlon nodded. The female [Warrior] looked towards the horizon, still tapping her fingers on the metal in her arm.</p>
<p>“So it seems like we only have two things to worry about. How to get Erin to Liscor safely, and what we should do while we’re waiting for Ryoka to contact us.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded. But Ksmvr had something else in mind. He stared back at Remendia, now a distant spot on the horizon.</p>
<p>“Do you think there will be crowds cheering us in Celum? I enjoyed the ones in Remendia.”</p>
<p>Pisces made a dismissive sound of disgust.</p>
<p>“I hope not. So much noise gets on my nerves.”</p>
<p>He paused.</p>
<p>“Although…mindless adulation is not without its merits. We should expect at least a small gathering; word will have spread of our exploits and no doubt there will be a commotion when we are recognized.”</p>
<p>“True, let’s just get through it as best we can.”</p>
<p>Yvlon smiled crookedly, but Ceria thought she looked a bit pleased at the idea. For her part, the half-Elf considered that she wouldn’t mind the attention. It was inconvenient of course after a while, but…</p>
<p>“Just so long as it doesn’t get to our heads. Fame is fleeting as adventurers, let’s not forget that.”</p>
<p>“Certainly not.”</p>
<p>“I will commit this to memory.”</p>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>
<p>The Horns of Hammerad settled back in their cart, nodding to each other. They fell into silence once more, waiting, contemplatively staring at the horizon towards the city of Celum, still invisible in the distance. The only sound was a snort that came from the wagon driver as the horses plodded onwards through the snow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were no cheering crowds in Celum, nor any parades, much to the disappointment of all the Horns of Hammerad. In fact, no one even batted an eyelid when the adventurers made their way through the gate.</p>
<p>“The Horns of Hammerad? Hm. Your name sounds familiar. You have anything to declare? No? Move on through, then.”</p>
<p>Dismayed, the adventurers walked past the first guard at the gates. It wasn’t as if they’d expected a huge reception. But how come no one had noticed their party’s name? Usually the exploits of adventuring teams were all gossiped about fiercely in all the local cities.</p>
<p>Either word hadn’t spread yet, or no one cared about a Silver-ranked team of adventurers, no matter what they’d done.</p>
<p>Then again…it did seem like the [Guardsmen] manning the gate had a lot on their minds. They all looked sleep-deprived, as if they’d been pulling two shifts instead of one.</p>
<p>Ceria stopped to talk to one of them in the gatehouse. He was mumbling to himself in a corner of the room—she hesitated as she drew near and heard what he was saying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub;<br>
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come<br>
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br>
Must give us pause: there’s the respect<br>
That makes calamity of so long life…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was he really that sleep-deprived? There was an odd cadence to his words. Ceria paused, wondering if she should find someone else to talk to, but she interrupted the man’s rambling self-reflection anyways.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, guardsman.”</p>
<p>He jumped and stared at her. His eyes were bloodshot, and the scraggly mustache on his face could have used some trimming.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, can I help you Miss…?”</p>
<p>He noticed her robes and her hand. To his credit he only stared for a few seconds.</p>
<p>“Are you an adventurer? Do you have anything to report? Monsters? Or something to declare?”</p>
<p>“No. I was just wondering. Is there any news? Any bad news?”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>The fuzzy-lipped man blinked at her.</p>
<p>“The Goblins.”</p>
<p>He blinked a few more times before the words trickled into whatever part of his brain was still thinking. For some reason he took a pose.</p>
<p>“‘There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.’ Ah…no, Miss. The Goblins haven’t shown up near Celum.”</p>
<p>“I see. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Ceria backed away from him and rejoined her group. Pisces twirled one finger around his ears as he gestured at the guardsman. Ceria just shrugged and led them into the city.</p>
<p>“Now, where’s Erin? Ryoka told me she was staying at a room in…which inn was it?”</p>
<p>“The Frenzied Hare, I think.”</p>
<p>It was a surreal experience, walking through a city where no one stared at them or came over to talk or shake their hands. Were the adventurers disappointed? Yes, a little bit, but at the same time it felt good to be normal again.</p>
<p>They were no heroes, and while they liked to be treated as one, it wasn’t why they’d become adventurers in the first place. True, many young men and women of every species joined for exactly that reason; to become rich and famous. But after they spent their first week shivering in the mud and rain while insects crawled all over them, or come face-to-face with a monster with too many teeth, such people usually quit.</p>
<p>True adventurers, Ceria reflected, wanted something other than just fame and fleeting fortune. Although that was a nice side-effect of success.</p>
<p>It wasn’t hard to find the Frenzied Hare. For some reason everyone the Horns of Hammerad asked could tell them exactly where the inn was.</p>
<p>“Going to see the night’s show? Good luck! I had to stand throughout the entire thing, although I’ll say it was worth it.”</p>
<p>“I’d go back again, but I’ve work early the next day. Maybe when the next play comes out…”</p>
<p>These remarks meant nothing to the Horns of Hammerad, but it reinforced Ceria and Pisces’ belief that Erin was staying at the inn.</p>
<p>“After all, if something strange is going on that girl probably had something to do with it.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded at Pisces’ comment and both Yvlon and Ksmvr were forced to agree. That was how they found themselves pushing the door to the inn open just before the sun set over the rooftops in the city.</p>
<p>To their surprise, the humble-looking inn was <em>packed. </em>The Horns of Hammerad opened the door and were treated to a heaving room full of people, crowding every table, talking, eating, so many that the adventurers had to edge carefully into the room to avoid stepping on toes.</p>
<p>It was a strange, surreal sight. The guests sat in eager groups, people who looked like they didn’t even know each other, willingly sharing tables and talking excitedly about the night’s play. It was an odd word they used. ‘Play’. They spoke of it as if it were something different, or a magical word, and it made the Horns of Hammerad glance at each other in confusion.</p>
<p>More aspects of the inn didn’t make sense. For instance, why was there a curtain on one end of the room? There was a good third of the common room that had no tables on it—why was no one sitting there? Ceria stared around, wondering what was going on.</p>
<p>“Do you see anywhere to sit?”</p>
<p>“There.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr spotted a table that was empty and immediately walked towards it. The other five patrons who’d been making a beeline for the table stopped when they saw the Antinium approaching and backed away. Ceria went to sit as well, but she and the other adventurers were stopped by a somewhat stout woman who came rushing over, waving her hands.</p>
<p>“Stop, stop! Please, I don’t know who you are—but even if you <em>are</em> adventurers, I’m afraid all the seats are taken. You’ll have to stand like the rest. You can’t just take over a table…”</p>
<p>She looked nervous, especially when she stared at Ksmvr, but she also sounded like she was ready to chase Ceria and the others away even if they protested.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Mistress. We didn’t know—what’s going on?”</p>
<p>Ceria waved at the crowds. The [Innkeeper], if that was who she was, looked surprised.</p>
<p>“You don’t know? Aren’t you here for the night’s play?”</p>
<p>“What play? You mean with toys? We’re here to see a friend. Erin Solstice. Do you know if she’s staying here?”</p>
<p>The woman’s eyes widened in shock. She glanced back at the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Erin? You want to meet—I’m so sorry, but she’s busy. Cooking. I’ll let her know you asked about her, but if she doesn’t keep working we’ll never get this crowd fed. If you’ll wait until tonight I’m sure—”</p>
<p>Pisces rolled his eyes. Fed up with the woman, he brusquely marched past her and towards the kitchen. She tried to stop him, but Ceria and Yvlon walked past her too.</p>
<p>“Erin?”</p>
<p>Ceria shouted into the open kitchen where the sounds of extreme cooking could be heard. She waited as the woman protectively barred the doorway.</p>
<p>“Erin? Are you in there? It’s me. Ceria! And Yvlon is here as well. We—”</p>
<p>The half-Elf heard a shout from inside the kitchen. A moment later a young woman practically ran the older innkeeper over. She shoved the protesting woman aside and then turned to the Horns of Hammerad. Erin Solstice, covered in flour, sweat, and a strange red paste Ceria vaguely recognized as tomato sauce spread her arms wide and rushed at her friend.</p>
<p>“<em>Ceria! Yvlon!</em>”</p>
<p>She practically tackled the two women, hugging them fiercely. Ceria laughed as people turned and looked, and Yvlon smiled as she gave Erin a welcoming hug. The girl turned, her eyes widening as she smiled.</p>
<p>“Ksmvr! And…you.”</p>
<p>She paused when she got to Pisces.</p>
<p>“Hey, you.”</p>
<p>He sniffed, hurt, but then Erin smiled and hugged him as well, much to the young man’s astonishment.</p>
<p>“You’re all okay! And alive! And—”</p>
<p>Erin saw Yvlon’s arms and gasped in shock. Yvlon opened her mouth to explain, but then the innkeeper was interrupting, trying to pull Erin back towards the kitchen.</p>
<p>“You know these adventurers, Erin dear? Can’t you have your reunion later? Folks are calling out for food!”</p>
<p>“They can wait. You cook if they’re so busy! Or get another inn to serve food! Shoo!”</p>
<p>Erin shoved the innkeeper away and then turned back to her friends. She stared at them, looking almost teary-eyed with relief.</p>
<p>“What happened? I was so worried! Ryoka only said—well, she left a message for me that you were in Remendia! Did you find the dungeon? She said you cleared it—”</p>
<p>Their reunion was attracting stares. Only naturally—Ksmvr might have been allowed into the city, but he was still an Antinium, and Yvlon’s arms were getting their own attention. It didn’t take long for people to put two and two together, even as excited as they were for this ‘play’.</p>
<p>“<em>The Horns of Hammerad! </em>The Conquerers of Albez!”</p>
<p>A huge cheer went up, although half of the guests probably didn’t even know what it was about. This was a crowd that would cheer anything, but soon there were people surrounding the Horns of Hammerad, talking excitedly.</p>
<p>At precisely the wrong time. Ceria, Pisces, Yvlon, and Ksmvr found themselves mobbed, and after a few minutes of chaos, Ceria managed to duck into the kitchen with Erin.</p>
<p>“You’re famous!”</p>
<p>That was what Erin said when they had a moment to speak. The hubbub was muted through the door, and Ceria sat against a kitchen counter, breathing heavily.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess. It’s still surprising—how are you <em>here</em>, Erin? The last time we met, you were in Liscor, nearly a hundred miles away from here! What’s this Ryoka said about Toren? Is there a problem?”</p>
<p>Erin’s face fell for a second. She turned around and Ceria noticed she was making food. Strange, circular sheets of dough slathered with pasted tomatoes and covered with cheese and meat. Ceria had eaten this food before, but it was still weird to her. What was it called again? Pizza?</p>
<p>“Yeah. He—it’s complicated. I’m making pizzas right now—sorry, I’ve got to keep working. But it’s great to know you’re okay. Except Yvlon! What happened to her arms?”</p>
<p>“It’s a long story.”</p>
<p>Ceria watched as Erin took a completed pizza—golden brown cheese glistening on top of the baked bread—out of the stone oven. Her stomach rumbled, and Erin laughed.</p>
<p>“You’re hungry! Well, good, because I’m making a ton of food! And you’re just in time! The play’s about to start! Oh, right—you don’t even know what’s happened. Well, just wait and see! You can watch it tonight. I’ll make Agnes get a table for you—unless you have another inn you’re staying at?”</p>
<p>The girl took a knife and diced the pizza up into gooey sections of eight which she placed onto plates. She turned to Ceria, smiling hugely.</p>
<p>“Why not stay here instead? But you’re probably staying at the best inn—that’s okay! I can visit you and besides, the beds here aren’t <em>that </em>great. But you should stay for dinner! It’ll be fun, I promise!”</p>
<p>Embarrassed, Ceria had to interject. She coughed as she confessed to Erin.</p>
<p>“We don’t uh, actually have the coin to stay at a good inn, Erin. We were hoping you could…”</p>
<p>The girl’s eyes widened in shock.</p>
<p>“You didn’t get <em>any </em>money from going through the dungeon? That’s terrible! Everyone was saying how great it was, but adventuring doesn’t pay, huh? You can stay at my inn—I mean, the inn I’m helping to run! Free of charge! I’ll be making pizza tonight and I’ll make a huge breakfast tomorrow!”</p>
<p>Ceria would have liked to protest, but she and the other Horns of Hammerad really didn’t have any room to argue. She could only smile and hug Erin. The other girl hugged her back, tightly. They stood in silence for a moment, countless words unspoken, just happy to see each other again.</p>
<p>Then the door opened and let in spilling noise and confusion. Erin turned back to her cooking after giving the distressed woman named Miss Agnes orders, and Ceria and the other Horns of Hammerad found themselves seated just in time to witness a play.</p>
<p>What was it? The Horns of Hammerad sat at a table right in front of the stage, staring in confusion at the men, women, and one female Drake all dressed up as if they were [Lords] and [Ladies]. They strutted about the stage, and then one began to speak. He declaimed to the audience, who went magically silent as they watched him, only pausing to eat the hot pizza and sip from their mugs.</p>
<p>And then…two Humans, a man and a woman, both dressed as [Guardsmen]—Ceria thought they actually <em>were</em> [Guardsmen]…met in the center of the stage. One called out to the other, who stood at clear attention.</p>
<p>“Who’s there?”</p>
<p>The woman on watch turned and put her hand on her sword, frowning deeply.</p>
<p>“Nay, answer me: stand, and reveal yourself.”</p>
<p>A briefest pause, and then the man cried out.</p>
<p>“Long live the [King]!”</p>
<p>The woman palpably relaxed. She took her hand away from her sword.</p>
<p>“Bernardo?”</p>
<p>The man nodded as he approached.</p>
<p>“He.”</p>
<p>What happened? One second the two were talking, and Ceria was wondering what in the name of fungus was going on, and then—</p>
<p>And then the play began. The Horns of Hammerad stared at the actors as they began to act, and realized as they were sitting what that word meant. Acting. Telling a story. Of course they’d heard of performers and storytellers and even the occasional reenactment of an event, but this? This was different. They sat in stunned silence as on the stage of the Frenzied Hare, the people in silly costumes came to life and told a story.</p>
<p>For Ceria’s part, she sat with a slice of hot pizza in front of her, chewing slowly and relishing the new taste. She tried to follow the performance on stage. What was this about some kind of revenge plot? Apparently the character – some [Prince] with an odd Human name – was trying to avenge his dead father, who’d come back as a ghost to ask him to slay his killer.</p>
<p>Human [Kings] and [Princes] and betrayal and death. Ceria had trouble keeping up with the plot in truth, but she felt mired by the sheer depravity of it all. The people on stage backstabbed and poisoned each other, dragging all down into death in the end.</p>
<p>It reminded her of Terandria, actually, and the rumors she’d heard of the games of politics played by each nation. She didn’t <em>like</em> the premise of the play, but she couldn’t look away. And the food was good.</p>
<p>But if she was the least-riveted by the performance, the same could not be said for Pisces. The instant the play began the mage was fixated, to the point where he actually stopped eating and just focused on the play.</p>
<p>He sat hunched forwards, eyes intent on each character as they spoke. Occasionally Pisces would sit back and nod his head or shake it sadly as they delivered complex verses in Shakespearean prose, or roll his eyes and smirk when a joke was spoken that passed over the audience’s head.</p>
<p>To Ceria’s right, Yvlon sat tensely in her chair, just as gripped by it. She was entranced too, although in her own way. Yvlon frowned when the premise of the play—a [Lord] who had slain the rightful [King] married the [Queen] to usurp the throne—was revealed. Thereafter she sat rigid in her seat, clearly rooting for the main character of the play to uncover the truth and bring down the traitorous villain.</p>
<p>And on the other side of the table? Ksmvr sat still, his slice of pizza drooping in his hand, staring as the tragedy unfolded. He seemed fascinated rather than emotionally moved, but Ceria didn’t see him look away once.</p>
<p>She suspected a lot of what was going on was passing right over—or perhaps between—the antennae on the top of his head. But he was a keen observer nonetheless, and sat almost completely still as he watched the play reach its conclusion.</p>
<p>When it was over, when the young [Prince] lay dying and the rest of the cast lay sprawled out on the floor and his friend called out an end to the sorry tale, the audience leapt to their feet. They cheered the actors who stood and bowed repeatedly, and only then did Ceria find out the name of the play. She had missed it when getting her pizza, but now the name of the play was on everyone’s lips as they talked excitedly about the story and called for more food and drink.</p>
<p>It was called Hamlet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was close to midnight before the inn finally cleared. The people left, most drunk and almost all half-asleep on their feet. The [Actors] had already left. Ceria had seen one of them—the [Guardsman] with the fuzzy mustache who’d played Hamlet—stumbling off, looking partly dead. She wondered how he could work his job and act like this every night.</p>
<p>The [Innkeeper] Miss Agnes and the staff of [Barmaids]—four of them, all needed to keep up with the crowds—had long since retired. Only Erin remained. She sat in the messy room, looking exhausted and happy. And with her sat the Horns of Hammerad.</p>
<p>There was a different kind of feel to the air as they sat, talking quietly and eating the leftover pizza Erin had made. The excitement from the play had gone—Pisces had asked Erin many questions about it, as had Ksmvr. She’d told them all about the first few performances of the tale of Romeo and Juliet, and how it had changed the city.</p>
<p>The play was a new, amazing thing. The tale enacted on stage was a classic. After the first night, the new [Actors] had put on repeated performances, each time filling the Frenzied Hare to the brim with eager, paying guests. Other inns had immediately tried to entice the performers to their inns, but the troupe had stayed here.</p>
<p>And of course, where success came, countless people followed, wanting to perform the play themselves, become [Actors]…Erin told the amazed Horns of Hammerad that other groups were already imitating the play, and even going to other cities to perform.</p>
<p>But the [Actors] with the highest levels were by far Wesle and Jasi and the original crew of people who kept performing. They had already gained a handful of Skills and they had been bitten repeatedly by the acting bug. So Erin had taught them another play, Hamlet, which they were performing each night to great success.</p>
<p>“I just don’t know what I’m going to do. They want to learn all the plays! And they said they want to create a travelling performance—just like Shakespeare did! It’s so wild!”</p>
<p>“Who’s Shakespeare? The one who wrote this play? Where does he live? Can I meet him?”</p>
<p>Pisces chewed the crust of the pizza furiously as he stared at Erin. Ksmvr was busy eating some raw dough—he was obsessed with the stuff, and only he could eat it with the charm against food poisoning. &nbsp;Erin just waved Pisces away, shaking her head.</p>
<p>“He’s long dead. And besides—there’s just so much to do! I’d like to stay, but doing these plays is <em>exhausting!</em> I can teach Wesle and the others the plays I know—some of them have [Perfect Recall] like me. But I just wanted to show them a play, you know? I didn’t expect it to get this <em>big.</em>”</p>
<p>“Forget famous. This will sweep across the world.”</p>
<p>Ceria sat back in her chair, amazed at the idea. She could already see the play becoming a huge hit in Terandria. Why, every [Lord] would want to put on a performance. How much money could be made from it? She couldn’t even imagine what would happen next.</p>
<p>Erin just shrugged. She hadn’t wanted to talk about the play at all. She stared at Yvlon’s arms again as the woman dozed in her chair.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe what happened to you guys. You’ve been through so much. And Ryoka…I thought she would come back with you.”</p>
<p>“I think she’s okay.”</p>
<p>Ceria tried to reassure Erin. She honestly had no idea what Ryoka was going through, or why she’d attracted the attention of Magnolia Reinhart, but Erin looked worried.</p>
<p>“She’ll be fine. She’s tough. And she has that Frost Faerie with her.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah! Ivolethe!”</p>
<p>The young woman brightened up, as if having a Frost Faerie follow you around was a good thing. She stared at the others and sighed.</p>
<p>“I’m just so glad you’re alright. So glad. I was worried.”</p>
<p>Ceria smiled slightly guiltily at Erin.</p>
<p>“We did it. It cost us a lot, but we did it.”</p>
<p>Pisces and Ksmvr nodded. Yvlon blinked and nodded as well, automatically.</p>
<p>“What—yes. Yes we did. And we have come here to repay the debt.”</p>
<p>“Not that we have any gold to pay you with.”</p>
<p>Pisces’ sardonic remark made Erin wrinkle her nose at him.</p>
<p>“I don’t care about that! I’m just glad you’re okay. Besides, Ryoka has all your stuff, right? When she comes back you can give me coin. Or a magical sword. That would be cool. Or the bag of holding! That would be so useful!”</p>
<p>“We owe you a great deal. We’ll find something worth repaying you with, even if it’s only a bucket full of gold.”</p>
<p>Ceria meant every word. Without Erin’s help they would have never had the coin to get to Albez, let alone found Ksmvr and joined up the way they had. Erin smiled, and then looked wistfully towards the window.</p>
<p>“And now that you’re here, you’ll help me go back, right? To Liscor?”</p>
<p>The others at the table sat up. Pisces cast a glance towards Ceria and she hesitated.</p>
<p>“I think we can. But it’s dangerous.”</p>
<p>“That’s okay. I’m used to danger.”</p>
<p>No one could disagree with that. Even so, Ceria hesitated. She looked around the inn. It was still messy, but it was a nice place, in its own way.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you couldn’t stay here? At least for a month or two? Celum isn’t bad.”</p>
<p>Erin looked at Ceria seriously.</p>
<p>“No, it isn’t bad. But Celum…it’s not Liscor, you know? All my friends are in Liscor—well, you’re here but you know what I mean. But my inn’s there, and so is Mrsha and Lyon and…I have to go back. Even if it’s dangerous. You get that, right?”</p>
<p>The half-Elf breathed out slowly as Ksmvr nodded across the table.</p>
<p>“I believe I do. We do. And we’ll help you get back, but we’ve got to be careful. But Erin, there’s one thing you haven’t talked about. How did you get here?”</p>
<p>Erin had been smiling at Ceria, but now her smile vanished in a flash. She looked down at the crumbs in the plate and drew a finger through them.</p>
<p>“Toren.”</p>
<p>Next to Ceria, Pisces sat up, looking suddenly alert and slightly worried. Ceria scooted closer to the table, staring at Erin.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Ryoka mentioned him. What about your skeleton, Erin? What happened?”</p>
<p>The girl looked at Pisces.</p>
<p>“He’s your creation, isn’t he? Can you tell where he is now?”</p>
<p>Pisces hesitated, then shook his head.</p>
<p>“I’m not linked to him at the moment. I can sense him, but only vaguely. He’s…to the south, a good distance away.”</p>
<p>“Okay. That makes sense. It…matches with what I’ve heard.”</p>
<p>Erin’s face was troubled. Ceria saw Yvlon staring at Pisces and the way the mage stared hard at Erin’s face.</p>
<p>“What did my creation do, exactly?”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you all I know. But it—it makes no sense.”</p>
<p>Briefly, Erin told the adventurers everything that had led up to her arriving at Celum. Ceria watched Pisces’ face. It changed only a little as Erin spoke, but when she talked about Toren disappearing he glanced down at his hands.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what happened. I just fell asleep…and then I was all the way over here. Toren must have dragged me here in the sled when I slept. But he left me in the middle of nowhere.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>The Human [Mage] tapped the table, seeming to think. He looked…slightly worried, Ceria thought, and a foreboding feeling appeared in her chest.</p>
<p>“Pisces. What happened to Erin’s skeleton?”</p>
<p>“I have a number of theories but…it would be best to collect more information first. Miss Erin, have you heard anything else of your skeleton?”</p>
<p>Erin nodded, and now she looked…sad. Terribly sad.</p>
<p>“I kept asking Wesle—the [Guardsman]—about him. At first there was nothing. But…the other day he told me a skeleton on the road was attacking people. He killed a bunch of travelers and buried them in the snow. A group of adventurers nearly got killed by him, and afterwards they found all the dead people. Over twenty of them.”</p>
<p>All four people in the room stared at Pisces. He raised his hands defensively.</p>
<p>“<em>I </em>didn’t order him to do that!”</p>
<p>“Well then, what the hell happened!?”</p>
<p>Ceria stood up in her chair. She pointed a finger at Pisces, who flinched.</p>
<p>“That sure sounds like your spell failing! Did Toren lose control somehow? Why did he start killing people?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I have an idea but—”</p>
<p>“That’s not all.”</p>
<p>Erin interrupted the two. They stared at her. Erin stared at them in the darkness, her face only lit by the few candles burning low in the inn.</p>
<p>“There’s more. A bunch of reports just came from Esthelm.”</p>
<p>Yvlon stirred in her seat, looking confused.</p>
<p>“Esthelm? I thought it was destroyed.”</p>
<p>Erin nodded.</p>
<p>“It was. But apparently a bunch of people survived. They managed to retake the city—they fought off another army of Goblins and a bunch of undead. Apparently, a Goblin army came by just as all the dead in the city began to rise. And the dead were being led by a skeleton. One who could fight like a swordsman and had purple eyes.”</p>
<p>Pisces froze in his seat. Ceria stared at him, but Erin wasn’t looking at either of them.</p>
<p>“The people apparently were being led by this [Knight] guy. He saved them. Everyone’s talking about him. The Savior of Esthelm. A Gold-rank adventurer named Ylawes Byres.”</p>
<p>Yvlon froze in her seat, eyes wide. Ceria stared at her.</p>
<p>“Is that a relative of yours, Yvlon?”</p>
<p>She vaguely remembered the name from somewhere. Where? Then Ceria remembered.</p>
<p>The pit. The pit of insanity. At one point Yvlon had claimed to be Ylawes. Now the woman closed her eyes. When she opened them, she smiled ruefully.</p>
<p>“I know Ylawes. He’s my older brother. He must have journeyed south to see me. He normally works far to the north, around our family estates.”</p>
<p>Everyone stared at Yvlon. She just shrugged, tired.</p>
<p>“Surprised? I’m only a Silver-rank, but my brother’s quite famous up north. His team—the Silver Swords—often take up causes like this one. Esthelm’s just another one of his triumphs.”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of the Silver Swords.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t as if Ceria knew all of the adventurer teams by heart, but the Gold-rank ones tended to stick in one’s memory. But she’d never known Yvlon had a brother. Then again, she’d never asked. It was surprising to say the least, but Yvlon didn’t seem to want to talk about her brother at the moment. She looked at Erin.</p>
<p>“Putting aside my brother…you said Toren was spotted at Esthelm?”</p>
<p>Erin nodded unhappily.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Leading the undead. They killed a lot of people. The attacking Goblins too, but a lot of people. It was definitely him.”</p>
<p>She looked at Pisces, helplessly.</p>
<p>“Why did he do it? Why did he run off and…”</p>
<p>All eyes were on the mage. He shifted in his seat, looking uncomfortable. Twice he glanced at Ceria, but then he sighed and sat up in his chair.</p>
<p>“Numerous theories come to mind. He could have been controlled, or simply gone rampant if my spells failed. However, both outcomes are unlikely in the extreme. My best theory is that he simply…grew too powerful for your commands to control him. And he decided to go his own way.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>The word came sharply from Ceria. She stared at Pisces, heart beating faster.</p>
<p>“Toren’s just a skeleton, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>She remembered the skeleton’s gaze, almost intelligent. Almost alive. Pisces hesitated.</p>
<p>“He may have developed the capacity for thought.”</p>
<p>“<em>Toren?</em>”</p>
<p>Erin looked incredulous. So did Yvlon. Ksmvr just stared silently at Pisces as the mage nodded.</p>
<p>“It can happen. Revenants retain the personality of their former selves. Toren is no Revenant of course, but he could have gained the…ability to think.”</p>
<p>“Gained.”</p>
<p>The word was heavy on her tongue. Ceria couldn’t look away from Pisces.</p>
<p>“You keep using words like that. Gain. Grew. But the undead can’t grow. They’re not alive. They can’t change unless a [Necromancer] alters them in some way. Nothing can. Unless they can level.”</p>
<p>Pisces stared past Ceria. Silent. Unmoving. Ceria’s pulse was thunder in her ears. She remembered the past. She remembered Wistram, and she gave voice to her fears.</p>
<p>“Toren couldn’t have changed. Unless you did it. You actually did it. You gave him, an undead, the ability to level.”</p>
<p>Erin’s eyes grew wide across the table. Yvlon sat up straight, and even Ksmvr grew shocked. Ceria just stared at Pisces. He looked ahead, face emotionless. Then, slowly, the façade broke. His lips turned up. He looked at Ceria.</p>
<p>And smiled.</p>
<p>“<em>You bastard!</em>”</p>
<p>Ceria leapt from her chair. She knocked Pisces out of his seat, and slung him to the ground. He gasped as she put her hands around his throat and tried to choke him. Ceria felt him push her hands off him as Pisces backed away, speaking quickly, urgently.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know he would gain any type of sentience! His capability to level up was only meant to be a feature, nothing more!”</p>
<p>“You <em>knew!</em> You gave Erin an undead that could level! Are you <em>insane!?</em>”</p>
<p>Ceria pursued Pisces, ready to punch his brains out. To her surprise, hands grabbed her. Ksmvr used three of his to hold her, and Yvlon grabbed her other arm. Erin was just sitting at the table, looking blank and shocked.</p>
<p>“Yvlon!”</p>
<p>“Calm down, Ceria. We need to know just what Pisces did before you beat him to a pulp.”</p>
<p>The look in the woman’s eyes clearly said a beating was in order either way. Pisces gulped, but began to explain. He was too eager to do so. Ceria glared at him across the table as the [Necromancer]’s eyes lit up as he told the group what he had done.</p>
<p>“Yes, Ceria is right. I created an undead that could level. Toren, as Erin named him. He was just an experimental prototype—something meant to repay her and guard her inn. But I wanted to see if he could level as well, so I gave him to Erin. I never expected him to gain sentience, though.”</p>
<p>“He can think?”</p>
<p>Erin stared at Pisces, looking horrified. He hesitated, and then nodded.</p>
<p>“He must be able to, to abandon you and do what he has done. Had you noticed him taking independent action or…questioning your orders?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t—I thought it was just him being weird. But now…”</p>
<p>Erin stared at her hands, blinking.</p>
<p>“I—yeah. He did. He was acting so odd lately and I was going to bug you about it. He can think? He’s alive?”</p>
<p>“And he can level.”</p>
<p>Ceria glared at Pisces. He edged away from her, but it was Yvlon who spoke. The woman looked deeply troubled.</p>
<p>“How? How is that possible? I’ve never heard of a leveling undead, ever. Not even the greatest [Necromancers] could make one.”</p>
<p>“More like none of them were crazy enough to try. Any undead that can level will eventually rebel, just like Golems.”</p>
<p>Ceria glared at Pisces. The young man raised his hands, looking nervous but elated.</p>
<p>“I told you it was possible. I told them all at Wistram. Toren was proof I could do it. But I never expected him to level up quickly enough to subvert my control. I did check, you know, whenever I saw him.”</p>
<p>“Not well enough. Look what’s happened!”</p>
<p>“How, though?”</p>
<p>Ksmvr was the one to speak. He stared at Pisces, looking troubled.</p>
<p>“Is comrade Pisces truly that great of a prodigy? Or is his level high enough that he is able to create such a miraculous undead through some Skill?”</p>
<p>The half-Elf shook her head, smiling darkly.</p>
<p>“He didn’t learn how to make leveling undead by himself. He’s not that smart.”</p>
<p>Pisces opened his mouth and then shrank back in his chair as everyone glared at him. Ceria explained.</p>
<p>“A Golem taught him. A Truestone Construct; one of the most powerful types of Golems in the world taught him an incomplete formula for creating beings capable of leveling up. And he—completed it.”</p>
<p>“So you made a thinking, leveling undead.”</p>
<p>Yvlon’s eyes could have bored a hole through the mage. He shook his head.</p>
<p>“I was taught a theoretical piece of magic, it’s true. But it’s still not perfect. It wasn’t even certain my creation—Toren—would be able to level.”</p>
<p>“But he did. And he learned to think!”</p>
<p>“Evidently.”</p>
<p>Pisces stared uncomfortably at Erin, and then away. She had a haunted, horrified look on her face.</p>
<p>“I made him do chores. But he could think the entire time?”</p>
<p>“Erin…”</p>
<p>Ceria reached out and touched her friend. Erin shuddered, and then stared at Pisces angrily.</p>
<p>“Okay, he was alive. But why did he start killing people? I never told him to do that! He just did chores for me!”</p>
<p>Pisces spread his hands out, helplessly.</p>
<p>“He probably wished to. I can only speculate, but as I told you once, Toren is not meant for peaceful activities. He may have rebelled out of his desire to fight.”</p>
<p>“Why? He’s not evil! I mean—he wasn’t made that way, right? All he did was do chores! How could he just kill like that?”</p>
<p>Erin tried to snap her fingers, but couldn’t. She was trembling. Pisces closed his eyes, when he opened them, he looked regretful for a moment.</p>
<p>“It is what he was made to do. You see—I made him to fight, to protect. I imbued him with the capability for rational thought in the fashion of Golems. Problem-solving skills; but nothing more, certainly not a groundwork for actual cognition. But I never gave him anything else.”</p>
<p>Erin turned towards Ceria. The half-Elf crossed her arms.</p>
<p>“He didn’t give him a conscience. Or…morality.”</p>
<p>“What? Why not?”</p>
<p>Pisces shrugged eloquently at Yvlon. She clenched her fist, and Ceria interjected.</p>
<p>“He can’t. He doesn’t know how.”</p>
<p>“Then why make a creature like that? You’re just inviting trouble!”</p>
<p>Ceria wasn’t about to defend Pisces on that. He just looked at her, though, haughty and unrepentant.</p>
<p>“Cognita has no moral compass. She functions well enough without one.”</p>
<p>“She’s a monster too. She’s killed more [Mages] than any other being in the world, I’ll wager. She might be helpful to some, but you know she’ll kill without a qualm as well.”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded reluctantly, but he still didn’t appear convinced what he’d done was wrong. Remorseful, yes, guilty, even. But he looked like he had when he stood in front of the Council of Wistram the day they’d exiled him. He was certain, and it made Ceria sick because at least in some way, he was right.</p>
<p>He’d done it. He’d actually done it. She could hardly bear to look at him.</p>
<p>Pisces turned back to Erin. The young woman was pale. She looked like she was about to vomit. The [Mage] modulated his tone, spoke softly and, for Pisces, gently.</p>
<p>“Let me be clear, Erin. This was not your fault. The error lay with me in underestimating the capability of my creation. Toren was a loyal servant until he grew strong enough to break the orders you and I had given him. Now he is a threat.”</p>
<p>“A killer. He killed people. Men. Women. Children. But he’s also like…a baby, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>“An odd way of looking at it. But I suppose he would be young.”</p>
<p>“Could you change him? Make him…not kill people?”</p>
<p>Erin looked up at Pisces, a glimmer of hope in her eyes. Ceria waited too. Pisces hesitated, but after a moment shook his head regretfully.</p>
<p>“I could stop him, perhaps. But it would be dangerous and all I would be able to do is render him harmless. Ceria is correct: I cannot give him a conscience. I do not know how. No one does.”</p>
<p>“You have to stop him.”</p>
<p>Yvlon said that. She stood up, staring at Pisces and Erin.</p>
<p>“If what you say is true, that skeleton is a huge threat. A thinking undead, one capable of leveling and leading others? It could become a threat capable of taking on Gold-ranked adventurers soon if not stopped.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Erin’s voice was quiet, but her eyes were suddenly focused. Her hands—she kept them on the table, but they trembled as she looked at Pisces.</p>
<p>“Can you stop him?”</p>
<p>“I can.”</p>
<p>The [Necromancer] said it quietly. He looked at Ceria and she understood.</p>
<p>“Severing the link?”</p>
<p>“It’s the easiest way.”</p>
<p>Pisces explained to Erin and the others.</p>
<p>“Erin feeds Toren with her natural mana. No matter how far away she is, he and she are connected. Without her mana, he cannot survive, powerful as he may be. If I cut it, he will cease to…live.”</p>
<p>Silence fell over the room. Yvlon opened her mouth, clearly wanting to tell Pisces to do it now, but she stopped when she saw Erin’s face. Ceria understood, a little bit. For all Erin yelled at her skeleton, Ceria had seen it with her since as long as she’d known Erin. It was Erin’s…</p>
<p>What? Friend was too strong a word. The girl had thought Toren was a mindless tool for the entire time. But she’d relied on him, even liked him. What he was to her couldn’t be explained in words.</p>
<p>And now she had to kill him.</p>
<p>“Perhaps we can track him down.”</p>
<p>That came from Ceria’s mouth. She blinked when she said it, but everyone stared at her and so she spoke, desperately trying to give Erin another option.</p>
<p>“If we set out, we might be able to track him down. You said he was at Esthelm? He may still be in the area. Or we could find him, look for rumors—”</p>
<p>“No. Do it now.”</p>
<p>Erin cut her friend off. She stared at Pisces. The mage stared back, looking as shocked as Ceria felt.</p>
<p>“Now?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Cut Toren’s supply of mana right now. This instant!”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>Why was Ksmvr saying that? But the Antinium had the same sense Ceria did. Erin was shuddering. Her face was pale and sweat stood out on her forehead. She was not well. But the look in her eyes was steel.</p>
<p>She spoke quietly to the others.</p>
<p>“He killed people. I asked, and I made sure. Toren killed people. Not just one, not just two, and not in self-defense. He killed them because…because he wanted to. And he’s going to keep killing people if he’s not stopped.”</p>
<p>She stopped, gulped. Erin closed her eyes, but then went on, voice hoarse, choking on her next words.</p>
<p>“If this were a movie…or a play…I’d be the stupid idiot who didn’t stop Toren before he killed thousands of people. He’s already killed dozens, maybe hundreds. And how strong would he become if he kept leveling up? Maybe if I knew I could find him I’d—but I can’t. He’s too far away. And I won’t let him kill anyone else. It has to be now.”</p>
<p>No one could answer her. It was the right decision. Pisces hesitated as Erin walked over to him.</p>
<p>“Do you need to cast a spell or something?”</p>
<p>“No. It’s a simple enough procedure. As the one who cast the spell I can unravel it. It will just take a minute—”</p>
<p>“Do it, then.”</p>
<p>Ceria stared at Pisces. He looked at her, uncertain. She just stared back. See, she wanted to ask him. See what you’ve done?</p>
<p>Pisces looked away. He made no sound, but after a moment laid his hands on Erin’s head. She shifted, once, and then was still.</p>
<p>No sound. No grand show of lights, no mystical chanting. Pisces just moved magic and Ceria saw a thread, thinner than silk and stronger than stone flowing from Erin out into the world. Pisces pulled at it and slowly, the connection broke.</p>
<p>That was it. It was over. He let go of Erin and she stared up at him.</p>
<p>“It’s done? He’s gone?”</p>
<p>“He will be. No undead can live without mana and Toren consumes…consumed more than most.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Erin took a few steps away from Pisces. She stared blankly at him, and then looked around the room. Everyone stared at her, Yvlon with a pale face, Ksmvr silently, Pisces full of what might have been regret, and Ceria with no idea what to say.</p>
<p>“I’m tired. I’m gonna go to sleep, okay?”</p>
<p>So saying, Erin began to walk up the stairs. She left the Horns of Hammerad behind and went into the small room that wasn’t hers and crawled onto the bed. She didn’t bother undressing, and lay down in the rough blanket. She put her pillow over her head, and curled up into the smallest ball possible.</p>
<p>She didn’t cry. She couldn’t cry. But something in her heart broke. Erin whispered the words into the night.</p>
<p>“Goodbye.”</p>
<p>She listened, hoping to hear a reply. But all she heard was silence.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>That night, Erin had a nightmare.</p>
<p>It started, as nightmares sometimes do, happily. Erin was dreaming she was back in her inn, with Mrsha and Selys and even Lyonette. She was watching Ryoka put on a play of <em>Hamlet</em> and chasing Lyonette around with a sword, trying to kill her because she was a [Princess].</p>
<p>Generally speaking that would have given the dream away, but Erin was in the dream and only yelled at Lyonette to hurry and get stabbed so she could go offstage and get water. Mrsha was wiggling around in Erin’s lap when she heard the knocking at the door.</p>
<p>Someone knocking? Even in her dream, the idea of someone coming to her inn was unexpected. And Erin didn’t <em>want</em> to have a guest. She wanted to watch Lyonette duel Ryoka with poisoned swords! Bemused and half-annoyed, Erin stood up. She walked over to the door—or rather found herself there without moving her feet, and opened it.</p>
<p>A skeleton stood in the doorway. Toren. Erin opened her mouth to order him, but she stopped.</p>
<p>There was no flame in his eyes. No purple fire—or even the original blue fire of his eyes. Nothing.</p>
<p>She stared into empty sockets. Dead sockets. He was dead.</p>
<p>Erin took a step back. Behind her, the inn vanished. The people in it disappeared. And Toren stood in the doorway.</p>
<p>His eyes began to bleed. Red liquid trickled out of the gaping holes in his head. Erin looked around. She had to clean up the blood. But then she looked down and she saw she was holding a bloody blade in her hands.</p>
<p>“Out, darn spot.”</p>
<p>Only that wasn’t the right line, was it? Was it damn spot? Erin stared down at her hands. Now she was on stage, only she was quoting from <em>Macbeth</em> instead of <em>Hamlet</em>! The crowd in the inn jeered at her and began to throw things. Miss Agnes stood to Erin’s left.</p>
<p>“I told you we didn’t have time to cook, dear. Look—they’re running out of food to throw.”</p>
<p>Erin looked, and Toren was standing in front of her.</p>
<p>He was dead.</p>
<p>He reached out for her. Erin backed away, dropping the knife, her hands still crimson. The blood dripped to the ground and began a stream. A river. It washed her away and she reached out for help, but Toren was dead.</p>
<p>And she fell, fell as the blood washed her down and suddenly she was falling into Toren’s eye socket. And the blackness was all around her and he reached for her—</p>
<p>Erin sat up with a gasp, sheets covered in sweat. It was still dark. She could hear movement downstairs—she realized she was in Agnes’ inn at the same time she remembered to breathe. She was frightened, upset, still half-asleep. And deeply sad.</p>
<p>She’d killed him. Toren. A skeleton, yes, but her skeleton. Something…someone who could think.</p>
<p>Just like that. But she had to do it. She had to. He’d killed people. Erin just wished she could have stopped him, could have…</p>
<p>“Why didn’t I realize it sooner?”</p>
<p>She put her head in her hands. She’d just thought he was a mindless thing, that was all. That his quirks were just…that. How could she have dreamed he’d ever learn to think? When she’d first met him, so long ago, he’d been so simple. But when she looked back, it all made sense.</p>
<p>He had learned to think. He’d found a soul, even if it was one that let him kill people. And she’d killed him. Just like that. In a second. With a few words.</p>
<p>And the worst part was, he might not be dead. Wouldn’t it be just like a movie, or a book to have him come back? If he was still alive—</p>
<p>Somehow, Erin got up. She couldn’t stay in bed, anyways. She had a job. Making food for her guests. She didn’t want to do it, but that was the thing about jobs. You had to do them, and there was a bit of relief in having to do something right now.</p>
<p>“Hey, Erin. Good m—”</p>
<p>Ceria Springwalker froze with the greeting on her lips as Erin walked down the stairs. Erin pretended not to hear and moved slowly into the kitchen. Part of her felt bad, but—what would she say to Ceria? It wasn’t a good morning at all.</p>
<p>Erin was in no mood to smile that day. She made food mechanically, but she had no desire to talk with anyone or deal with a crowd. And so the rest of the Horns of Hammerad, waking up to the smell of good food—noticed that the inn was oddly empty that morning.</p>
<p>Surprisingly so, given the popularity of last night and the quality of the food. It had to be Erin’s new Skill, but no one dared suggest to the girl that she might be using it unconsciously. Even the supposed actual innkeeper, Miss Agnes, walked wide of Erin as she sat at a table with the others and picked at her plate.</p>
<p>“This is <em>your</em> fault.”</p>
<p>Ceria told Pisces that over breakfast. He nodded, uncharacteristically humble.</p>
<p>“I regret the necessity of what occurred last night. But I must point out that Erin’s decision was the most correct one she could have made.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t change how she feels. She likes <em>Goblins</em>. How do you think she feels about killing her pet skeleton?”</p>
<p>No one answered the rhetorical question. Ceria drummed her fingers on the table and looked at Pisces sideways. She hesitated, then asked anyways.</p>
<p>“I’m not asking you to, but…<em>can</em> you make another one?”</p>
<p>Across the table, Yvlon sat up straight in her chair and looked hard at Ceria. She hadn’t said a word to Pisces all morning, not even to greet him. Ceria ignored the look and stared at Pisces. He ran a hand through his hair, shrugging and then shaking his head.</p>
<p>“Theoretically? Of course. I did it once and I am a higher level than I was. But practically? The creation of Toren was a culmination of years of work. I had to do much…groundwork and the materials I used in his animation were exceedingly rare. Practically unique.”</p>
<p>He looked at Ceria and then away. With a jolt she realized there could only be one thing he was referring to. He’d used <em>those?</em> On Toren?</p>
<p>Surely not all of them? It explained how Toren was able to regenerate. But how many had Pisces used? She opened her mouth to ask for more details and saw Yvlon staring at her. Ceria closed her mouth. Pisces went on.</p>
<p>“However, even if I did attempt to mimic my original design…I believe the product would not be something Miss Solstice desires. As you so adroitly pointed out, the theorems Cognita passed on to me were incomplete. True sentience is a byproduct of the spell matrices animating Golems and in this case, the undead.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded, although she saw Yvlon’s eyes quickly glaze over. That’s what happened when Pisces began to pontificate. Ksmvr was still listening intently, though.</p>
<p>“For all Cognita was Archmage Zelkyr’s greatest creation, even she admits her existence is an accident. The same goes for my creation of a new skeleton. Either the same issue will arise again, or I will create a truly mindless slave. Irregardless, it will not be Toren.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I get it.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded tiredly and looked at Erin. The girl was just staring down into her plate of bacon and rearranging them. Not into a face—she was stacking them up and then spearing as many bits as she could with her fork.</p>
<p>“We should do something for her.”</p>
<p>“I wish you the best of luck.”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded. Ceria turned to him, frowning.</p>
<p>“What’s that supposed to mean. If you think you’re going to run off while we—”</p>
<p>He raised his hands.</p>
<p>“Please, Springwalker. Credit me with some—well, that is part of the reason. But I believe you will agree with my reasoning when I explain myself.”</p>
<p>“Hurry up, then.”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded. He was clearly trying to make an effort to be sociable today.</p>
<p>“I would like to hire a horse—or perhaps wagon—and visit Albez to recover an artifact our expedition left behind.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The other Horns of Hammerad stared at him. Ceria frowned.</p>
<p>“What artifact? We couldn’t have possible left anyt—oh.”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened as she realized what Pisces was talking about. She glanced around as he nodded, keeping his face smooth and calm. No one was sitting close to them, for which Ceria was suddenly grateful.</p>
<p>“It slipped my mind as well, but I believe it would be an egregious waste to leave it there. With luck, any scavengers will have overlooked it if they even found our dig site.”</p>
<p>“True.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded. She ignored Yvlon and Ksmvr’s confused looks as she pondered the issue.</p>
<p>“Yeah, going now would be best. We don’t have much coin—”</p>
<p>“We could borrow it.”</p>
<p>Dismayed, Ceria looked at Erin. But they had no choice, did they?</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll ask Erin. Pisces, are you intending to go alone? Albez attracts monsters and more could have popped up by now.”</p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“I am adept at using the [Invisibility] spell, you know.”</p>
<p>She hadn’t forgotten. Ceria frowned at Pisces.</p>
<p>“Monsters have noses. Some of them do, at any rate.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr raised his hand.</p>
<p>“I shall go with comrade Pisces. Although what is it that we are seeking?”</p>
<p>Pisces smiled knowingly.</p>
<p>“Simply recall our journey through the dungeon and you will come to the natural conclusion, Ksmvr.”</p>
<p>The Antinium paused. Yvlon looked at Ceria. The half-Elf just shrugged.</p>
<p>“Probably best if we don’t say it out loud. You never know.”</p>
<p>The woman frowned. Ceria looked at Erin and sighed.</p>
<p>“I’m going to stay with Erin. But if Ksmvr goes with you, Pisces, I’ll feel a lot better. Yvlon—”</p>
<p>“I’ll stay here.”</p>
<p>Yvlon said that almost too quickly. Ceria looked at her and nodded slowly.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll talk to Erin.”</p>
<p>The girl was staring at a fork loaded with greasy bacon when Ceria walked over.</p>
<p>“Hey, ah, Erin.”</p>
<p>“Mm?”</p>
<p>The girl didn’t look at her. Ceria coughed, looked around once, and then bent over to talk with her.</p>
<p>“I’m really, really embarrassed to ask this, but Pisces thinks there’s something else we could recover from Albez. Could you—”</p>
<p>Erin unhooked her money pouch from her belt and thrust it at Ceria.</p>
<p>“Grn.”</p>
<p>The half-Elf blinked at the pouch. She took it, extracted a few coins, and then gave the pouch back to Erin. She tossed the coins at Pisces who magically caught them in the air. He nodded to her and walked purposefully out of the inn with Ksmvr following. Ceria caught the Antinium asking Pisces again as they left.</p>
<p>“What is the artifact? I do not understand.”</p>
<p>Yvlon came over and smiled at Erin.</p>
<p>“Hey, Erin. How are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Blmblcrkn.”</p>
<p>It was probably a reply. Ceria stared at Erin, and then took the plate away from her. And the fork. It clearly wasn’t helping matters.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we go around the city? Come on.”</p>
<p>Ceria and Yvlon practically dragged Erin out of the inn, whereupon both did all they could to cheer Erin up. It worked, a bit. But the main reason Erin snapped out of her fugue was when the [Actors] came calling.</p>
<p>“Another huge success. I was on patrol and I was talking nonstop about the play last night. Barely got down the street before my shift was over.”</p>
<p>Wesle was talking excitedly with the others, stroking his non-existent mustache excitedly. Beside him, Jasi was all aglow with happiness, as she had been every day. Grev was already running about, his rucksack bulging with props, changes of costumes, and scripts.</p>
<p>Wesle and Jasi weren’t the only two [Actors] of course. But they were certainly the stars. The other men and women – a surprising number being from the Watch – were all eager, expectantly waiting on Erin to help them learn another play in their spare time.</p>
<p>Faced with such enthusiasm, Erin couldn’t help but respond in kind. They’d just finished learning Hamlet, and while they might perform that now and then, she had to get them working on another play.</p>
<p>She hesitated. In truth, Erin hadn’t gone to that many plays over the course of her life. She now wished she’d seen musicals like <em>Wicked</em>, or at least watched it on Youtube. She knew <em>Phantom of the Opera </em>of course, but she didn’t actually like that play so much. The Phantom was a jerk when you got down to it.</p>
<p>What else could she perform? <em>Macbeth?</em> Erin shuddered. No. Not that. And she didn’t want to do Shakespeare at the moment for much the same reason.</p>
<p><em>Pygmalion</em>? But it would be so hard to do the accents…Erin frowned. What about <em>A Doll’s House?</em> But then…that was too modern, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>“Drat.”</p>
<p>Ceria and Yvlon stood to the side of the inn, cleared out to give the [Actors] some room, talking intently. Excusing herself from the [Actors] who seemed only too happy to compare stories about the accolades they’d received, Erin wandered over. Would they like to act? Ceria probably wouldn’t, but then again…and Yvlon could probably play a great knight, right?</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re thinking of doing, but don’t.”</p>
<p>Erin paused as she got within earshot. Ceria was talking in a serious tone of voice, staring at the other adventurer. Yvlon looked…tense.</p>
<p>“He’s a danger. You heard what he can do!”</p>
<p>“I know. And I’ve known how talented he is. He might be arrogant and stupid and thoughtless, but Pisces doesn’t deserve to be killed just for creating one undead.”</p>
<p>“And the people that thing killed? What if he makes another one?”</p>
<p>“If he does, I’ll make sure he keeps it on a leash.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>Yvlon folded her arms and winced. Ceria scowled, not able to answer.</p>
<p>“The fact that he <em>hasn’t</em> made another one tells you he’s thought of the dangers as well.”</p>
<p>“Or that he’s waiting to gain enough levels to control them completely. And then what? Do we have a second Necromancer walking about?”</p>
<p>“I’m telling you, it won’t come to that.”</p>
<p>“I can’t—”</p>
<p>The two women stopped when they realized Erin was standing next to them. Ceria turned, trying to smile. Yvlon didn’t even bother trying.</p>
<p>“Erin. Um, is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“Don’t kill Pisces just because he made Toren. Please.”</p>
<p>Erin said that to Yvlon. The woman crossed her arms defensively, looking grim.</p>
<p>“I know he’s your friend. But I can’t just ignore what I’ve heard.”</p>
<p>“Pisces isn’t a bad person.”</p>
<p>Yvlon stared at Erin incredulously. Ceria had a similar look on her face as well. Erin shook her head.</p>
<p>“He’s not. I know he’s really, really, <em>really</em> annoying, but he’s actually sort of a good guy inside. He’s saved my life at least twice. One time he froze a swarm of Acid Flies that were about to melt me, and the other—he sent a bunch of undead to protect me when Skinner attacked.”</p>
<p>“Really? I didn’t hear about that.”</p>
<p>“I never told anyone. But I saw them—ghouls and zombies and skeletons. They helped protect me when the undead were attacking my inn. Only Pisces could have sent them, but he never mentioned it.”</p>
<p>Yvlon hesitated, but she still looked unconvinced.</p>
<p>“Still—”</p>
<p>“You’re on his team. You can watch him better than if you scare him away.”</p>
<p>Ceria reminded Yvlon. The woman grimaced and sighed.</p>
<p>“Fine. He’s my teammate too, Ceria. Silver and steel, why can’t anything ever be simple? My brother never mentioned having trouble with his group, and one of them is a Dwarf.”</p>
<p>“A Dwarf? Really?”</p>
<p>Erin was fascinated. Yvlon nodded, smiling a bit.</p>
<p>“They’re rare enough on Terandria, never mind the other parts of the world. Ylawes said it was pure luck he ran into him in a tavern.”</p>
<p>“He’s your brother, right? He came all this way to look for you?”</p>
<p>That sounded like a great brother to Erin, who’d never had siblings. Yvlon grimaced, though. She spoke reluctantly.</p>
<p>“He’s…overprotective. And a far better adventurer than I.”</p>
<p>That was clearly all she wanted to say on the topic. After a second Yvlon changed the subject. She glanced behind Erin at the [Actors].</p>
<p>“I thought they came here to learn a new play.”</p>
<p>“They did. I just don’t know what I should teach them.”</p>
<p>Erin confessed to her friends. Ceria just shrugged. She liked the play she’d seen, but she couldn’t imagine practicing with the enthusiasm the others seemed to have.</p>
<p>“Let us know if we can help. I’m not going to memorize any lines, but I could always do a few spells if the performance needs more action.”</p>
<p>She flicked a few sparks of electricity from her fingers, making Yvlon swear. Ceria looked abashed—Erin saw the electricity trying to jump onto the metal on Yvlon’s arms.</p>
<p>“You can do that? Well of course!”</p>
<p>Erin slapped her forehead as she realized how stupid she’d been. Special effects! Any [Mage] could add so much to a performance! Especially someone like Ceria. At the very least, she could help cool down the inn when it was so full of people. Even on a winter night, so many bodies were stiflingly hot. But Ceria could probably lower the temperature enough to…</p>
<p>Erin’s thoughts slowed down. She stared at Ceria. The half-Elf just blinked at her.</p>
<p>“Erin?”</p>
<p>She had lovely blonde hair. Well—in point of fact Ceria had dirty blonde hair. But Yvlon, now, she looked beautiful, and blonde as could be. Both women made Erin jealous—she didn’t think she had a bad face or hair, but compared to Yvlon’s beauty and Ceria’s otherworldly appearance, she felt plain. And Ceria could use frost magic.</p>
<p>And it was winter…</p>
<p>“Erin? Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Winter plus frost magic equaled…what? It had to do with plays, and it was on the tip of her tongue! Erin screwed up her face as Ceria looked at her.</p>
<p>“Erin, do you need to sit—”</p>
<p>“<em>Frozen!</em>”</p>
<p>The word exploded out of Erin’s mouth. Ceria blinked, wiped a bit of spit off her face, and stared at Yvlon. The other woman looked just as confused.</p>
<p>“You want Ceria to freeze the actors? The audience?”</p>
<p>“No, no!”</p>
<p>The young woman waved excitedly at the other two, mind suddenly ablaze with ideas. She looked at Ceria, and then began waving at the [Actors]. They were already congregating around her, sensing the impending drama.</p>
<p>“Hey you guys, come on over! I just had the greatest idea for the next performance we can do! It has singing!”</p>
<p>“Singing?”</p>
<p>Ceria raised her eyebrows, intrigued. She looked at Erin as the girl beamed at her.</p>
<p>“I like songs. Are there any good ones?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was no piano accompaniment. Pianos did exist in this world, but no one was going to lug one over to the Frenzied Hare. Instead, a few [Musicians] with string instruments provided a decent melody. That had been the hardest part.</p>
<p>The singing was not. On stage, Jasi, playing as the [Ice Queen] named Elsa sang a song so famous that it needed no introduction. Nor, it seemed, any plot. The play was over, but the song was being sung once more to a crowd who cheered as Jasi raised her hand to raise her castle of ice out of the wooden stage.</p>
<p>From behind the curtains backstage, Ceria cast weak frost spells, making snow and cold winds blow across the cheering audience. Concentrating hard, she made snow appear and fall over the fake little castle that they’d built. The snow melted almost instantly in the sweltering room, but the crowd didn’t care. They cheered wildly as the song reached its thrilling conclusion.</p>
<p>Again. The [Mage] scowled at Yvlon and whispered to her as the song finished.</p>
<p>“This is the <em>third </em>encore performance!”</p>
<p>The other woman was sitting on a stool behind the stage, smiling as she ate tonight’s meal, fish and chips, which was to say, fish and fried pieces of potato that Erin insisted were in some way ‘french’.</p>
<p>“Bear with it. It’s cheering Erin up.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the other girl was clearly enjoying herself. Even though she was in the kitchen, Ceria could see her poking her head out every now and then to beam at the audience.</p>
<p>“Catchy song, though.”</p>
<p>Ceria shrugged.</p>
<p>“It loses its charm fast, especially when you’ve got to do the effects.”</p>
<p>“At least we’re being paid.”</p>
<p>“What’s with ‘we’?”</p>
<p>The half-Elf groused, but she had to smile. They were indeed being paid, and quite handsomely because the entire acting cast took a cut of the profits. And judging by the way the bag Grev carried around had to be emptied now and then, even a small cut would be a lot.</p>
<p>“You have to wonder though…where does Erin get all these stories from?”</p>
<p>Yvlon frowned as Jasi bowed and declined another performance. The audience called out in disappointment, but then rushed forwards to shake hands with the bowing [Actors] and buy them drinks.</p>
<p>Carefully, the half-Elf sat back on her haunches and didn’t quite look at Yvlon.</p>
<p>“They come from her nation, I guess. She’s from far off.”</p>
<p>“Really? What continent?”</p>
<p>“Erin’s never said. I think it’s private. Ryoka’s from the same place, though.”</p>
<p>“Really? That makes sense.”</p>
<p>The two sat behind the curtains, looking through it at the room full of life and a different kind of magic. After a while, Ceria sighed.</p>
<p>“It really is better than adventuring, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Yvlon nodded, seeing Wesle surrounded by admiring young women—and older women—and males, come to it, but mostly young women—and the other [Actors], just as adored. It was like how they’d been treated in Remendia, but somehow more intimate and even more reverential at the same time. The citizens had hailed the Horns of Hammerad as people, but these [Actors] had brought another world to life in front of the people here.</p>
<p>“No monsters to fight, good food if you’ve got the right inn…”</p>
<p>“Admiring crowds, if you like sweaty Humans. Lots of coin…”</p>
<p>The two sat in silence. After a while, Yvlon shook her head.</p>
<p>“Not for me.”</p>
<p>Ceria smiled.</p>
<p>“Me neither. I guess we’re doomed fools, aren’t we?”</p>
<p>The woman laughed.</p>
<p>“Maybe not if Pisces gets back with that invincible artifact of his.”</p>
<p>“Oh? You figured it out?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t hard, and he’s right. It might be useful. Do you think he’ll be back tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“Early, hopefully. They’ll camp out in a safe place, or maybe just stay in Ocre. He says with a wagon driver who has a movement Skill they can be back very soon.”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day, Erin woke up feeling better. A lot better. She was still sad though, when she remembered why she should be. But she was better.</p>
<p>And now she knew what to do. She greeted Ceria and Yvlon cheerfully over breakfast—spiced porridge—and didn’t beat about the bush.</p>
<p>“It’s time to go back to Liscor.”</p>
<p>Yvlon only raised her eyebrows and Ceria smiled, but Miss Agnes, who’d joined them for breakfast, choked.</p>
<p>“What? But Miss Erin, surely you should wait. There are Goblins on the road and I don’t know <em>what</em> we’ll do without you. Why, there are all these fine [Actors] depending on you now…”</p>
<p>Sitting at a table next to theirs, Jasi, Wesle, and Grev looked up and gave Miss Agnes a flat look the woman failed to notice. It was their custom to eat together each day, especially since Jasi and Grev were staying at the inn.</p>
<p>“I really don’t know what we’ll do without you, Miss Erin. I’m sure we could tour other cities doing the plays you taught us. But I’d love to learn the rest…”</p>
<p>“I know. I know, and I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Erin smiled ruefully at Jasi and ruffled Grev’s hair. He looked upset. But Erin’s mind was made up.</p>
<p>“I need to go back. Liscor is my…home. Mrsha’s there and she’s all by herself. And Lyon’s there too—I nearly forgot about her, but Selys say she’s managing the inn. Somehow. But I need to get back before it falls apart or burns down or something.”</p>
<p>The others had objections of course. Sensible ones, selfish ones…Erin ignored them all. She looked at Ceria and Yvlon.</p>
<p>“When Pisces and Ksmvr get back, how long until we can go?”</p>
<p>“Within the hour, if we get transport set up. We’ll have to take a wagon, but we can get good horses and maybe even a driver.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded to Yvlon, already thinking of their route. The older woman nodded, biting her lip.</p>
<p>“Esthelm being retaken works for us. We can plan to stop there if we can avoid Goblin raiding parties. I’m not sure how safe it is—it’s reportedly still a ruin, but better that than camping by ourselves. And if we run into my brother’s group…”</p>
<p>“You think we can get them to help us escort Erin?”</p>
<p>Yvlon nodded slowly.</p>
<p>“My brother will help anyone in need. The real problem might be afterwards. He’ll try to take me north. But we’ll cross that bridge if we get to it.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded silently. She didn’t want to pry too much, but perhaps she should ask Yvlon why she didn’t want to go home so badly. Erin thought of what she had to do.</p>
<p>“I should say goodbye to Octavia.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All things considered, Erin thought Octavia took the news well. There weren’t even any tears. Or hugs. Or even a trace of sadness, really.</p>
<p>The dark-skinned [Alchemist] grinned happily and practically leapt off her stool in delight.</p>
<p>“You’re going? Well, I won’t say I’m not relieved—I’ve never met anyone so insane as you. When I count the times I nearly died—of course, I’m glad you came by before you left. I’d hate to have to charge interest on what you owe me when Ryoka gets back.”</p>
<p>“Hold on. What fees? Ryoka paid you already.”</p>
<p>Erin frowned at Octavia. The stitch-girl’s dreadlocks swung as she shook her head condescendingly.</p>
<p>“That was for a few days. You’ve been here far longer—I’ll admit she paid interest now and then, but if you factor in the number of discoveries you’ve made under my watchful supervision—not to mention hazard pay and having me participate in that play—”</p>
<p>“I’m gonna hit you.”</p>
<p>In the end, Erin didn’t hit Octavia and the girl didn’t get any more money, much to both girls’ disappointment. But to her surprise, Octavia hugged Erin before she left.</p>
<p>“You take care, alright? If you ever need a potion, I’m sure Ryoka can run it down to Liscor for me. Who knows? We might meet again! And if we do, you’re banned from ever mixing potions in my shop again.”</p>
<p>Erin laughed and hugged Octavia back. She’d miss her, she was surprised to realize. She’d miss Octavia’s fast-talking ways. She’d miss the horrible smells in her shop—</p>
<p>She’d miss the entire city, if it came to that. Celum was…it wasn’t as nice as Liscor, in some ways. It wasn’t as exciting, and the people were just people. But it had its own charm, and it had taken Erin in when she was lost.</p>
<p>She’d miss it. But she had to go. So Erin went back to the Frenzied Hare and caught up with Ceria who’d found someone willing to make the relatively dangerous journey to Liscor, provided a Silver-rank team was going with him. Yvlon had brought provisions for the journey and asked about the roads—no Goblin armies had been sighted close to any cities, although raiding groups had torched a few villages.</p>
<p>All they had to do was wait for Pisces and Ksmvr. And as it happened, the two were already close to the city. And they had the artifact in tow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier that day, Pisces had been willing to fight an entire Goblin army if it meant shutting Ksmvr up.</p>
<p>“What is the artifact? I still do not understand. Please enlighten me, comrade Pisces.”</p>
<p>It was the 38<sup>th</sup> time the Antinium had asked Pisces the question. Pisces knew that because he’d counted. Each time. They were sitting on a bumping wagon as it drove towards the Ruins of Albez. The mage blinked wearily as the dawn’s light hit his face.</p>
<p>It was far too early for this. But they had to move quickly, if they wanted to be back in Celum before evening. Ksmvr poked Pisces and the [Mage] snarled at him.</p>
<p>“Stop that!”</p>
<p>“I will if you answer my question. What is the artifact?”</p>
<p>“I told you to figure it out yourself!”</p>
<p>Part of Pisces dearly wanted to tell Ksmvr just to get it over with, but the young [Mage] was too stubborn for that.</p>
<p>“All the clues should be obvious. You were <em>there!</em> Just…think!”</p>
<p>“I have thought. I do not know what it could be. I wish for you to tell me.”</p>
<p>“Dead gods. It’s the <em>door, </em>the door. Okay!?”</p>
<p>That didn’t come from Pisces. It came from the wagon driver. She turned around, glaring, her eyes red and bloodshot. She was the same wagon driver who’d taken them from Remendia. She was the only one willing to risk her neck going so close to Albez, and clearly, she was unhappy with her decision.</p>
<p>Both [Mage] and Antinium stared at her. The wagon driver glared at them. After a moment, Pisces spoke.</p>
<p>“How did you come to that conclusion?”</p>
<p>“You explained it to the Ant about a half-dozen times. It was <em>obvious. </em>The door’s the only thing you lot didn’t take, apart from the ashes and the dungeon itself!”</p>
<p>The woman snapped at the two of them. Pisces turned to Ksmvr.</p>
<p>“You see?”</p>
<p>The Antinium only cocked his head sideways.</p>
<p>“Why is the door important? I do not understand. Please explain it to me, comrade Pisces.”</p>
<p>“First, call me comrade one more time and I will blast your mandibles <em>off</em> your face. Second—”</p>
<p>Pisces hesitated. But now that the secret was revealed, he had a deep urge to explain everything.</p>
<p>“The door is important because it cannot be destroyed. And it has a potent teleportation spell worked into its makeup.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded. He sat back in the wagon and stared up at the grey sky. It was far too cold, he felt, even with the warming spells that allowed him to wander around in nothing but his dirty robes. He gestured at Ksmvr to relax; the Antinium stayed sitting perfectly upright. Pisces made a face, but began to explain.</p>
<p>“Do consider it, dear Ksmvr. In our haste to acquire our spoils and flee the area, we had neglected to consider the magnitude of enchantment that must have been laid on this door. Not only did it survive a magical fire that damaged every artifact it touched—but it actually destroyed part of the fire construct when we used it as an impromptu weapon.”</p>
<p>“Ah yes. It was quite useful.”</p>
<p>“And yet, we, in our rush to escape, completely neglected to remember it. A vast oversight. Then again, I do not believe we could have carried it away as exhausted as we were. Fortuitously, my adept memory seized upon our neglect and led me to—”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah. Shut up and go get it already, would you?”</p>
<p>The wagon jerked to a halt, making Pisces bite his tongue. He glared at the woman driving the wagon, but she just stared back.</p>
<p>“Hurry up. If you want to be back in Celum, get moving. I’m not waiting around in this place forever. Even if it’s winter, monsters could still be about.”</p>
<p>That was true, and so Pisces and Ksmvr cautiously descended into Albez. They were quite willing to retreat at the first sight of any monsters, door or no door, but it seemed the ruins were still quite deserted.</p>
<p>“Let us go then, Ksmvr. Your strength should be invaluable in carrying the door.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Pisces. I shall lead the way in case monsters have retaken the dungeon.”</p>
<p>“Good point. I’ll stay…this far behind you. Lead on!”</p>
<p>There were no monsters, although there was a good deal of ash. Pisces and Ksmvr found the door lying in a pile of it. The [Mage] sneezed when Ksmvr pulled the door out. The Antinium nodded as he lifted it upright with all three of his arms.</p>
<p>“I can carry my end of it quite easily. If you will assist me—”</p>
<p>“Not so fast. We must descend into the pit.”</p>
<p>The Antinium paused and turned to Pisces in surprise.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded at the door.</p>
<p>“The door is only half of the spell. The other half, if you recall, teleports us to a set location. Into the pit in this case. A small object—usually a stone, perhaps some other mundane object—acts as the anchor for the teleportation spell. We must recover it or I’ll be teleported here if I should make a mistake with the door.”</p>
<p>“But is it not extremely dangerous? Captain Ceria covered the [Insanity] spell with mud, but it may have been removed in the time since we were gone.”</p>
<p>Pisces smiled confidently.</p>
<p>“Have no fear, Ksmvr. I am well-prepared for this eventuality.”</p>
<p>As it turned out, his solution was much the same as Ceria’s. After Pisces built a staircase out of bone, he cast a spell which filled the pit with billowing yellow smoke. Coughing and swearing, the mage descended into the pit and shot clinging mud in every direction. After he’d released the spell and Ksmvr had come down, the Antinium saw the pit was covered, with no sign of the [Insanity] symbols on the walls.</p>
<p>“That was quite admirable, Pisces.”</p>
<p>He complimented the wheezing mage. Pisces coughed, and waved a hand.</p>
<p>“Think nothing of it. This is a simple trap to bypass, if the correct precautions are taken.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr nodded at the plain truth of that statement. He looked around.</p>
<p>“And where is this anchoring stone?”</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t be too big. It could even be the size of my hand—smaller. I can find it ah…if I trace the magic link…here!”</p>
<p>Pisces frowned and then pointed to a spot directly in the center of the pit. It turned out what he was looking for was a round stone small enough to fit into his palm, embedded into the stone bottom of the pit. This proved to be very difficult to extract. Ksmvr still had the Goblin’s enchanted short sword, but even with all his strength he could barely chip at the stone floor of the pit.</p>
<p>“Of course it <em>is</em> designed to be a trap.”</p>
<p>Pisces groused as he began blasting the area around the stone with flames. Both he and Ksmvr knew that stone when heated was far more vulnerable to cracking. After about ten minutes of sustained fire blasting the ground, it was weakened enough for Ksmvr’s blade to crack the stone.</p>
<p>“It is very hot, Pisces.”</p>
<p>So saying, Ksmvr handed the magical stone—which showed no damage despite the heat—to Pisces. The [Mage] swore and dropped it the moment he touched the black rock.</p>
<p>“It’s <em>burning!</em>”</p>
<p>“That is what I said.”</p>
<p>“Then don’t—allow me to choose a far more sensible solution.”</p>
<p>The wagon driver, whose name was Adelynn, although no one had bothered to ask it, was dozing in her driver’s seat when her horses took fright. She looked up and blanched as she saw the six skeletons carrying the enchanted door and anchoring stone over their heads. Pisces and Ksmvr sat on the door like a seat. They waved at the wagon driver. Only when they got close did she throw a bit of snow at them.</p>
<p>“Call your damn undead away, [Necromancer]! You’ll spook my horses! I swear, if they wrench an ankle you’ll all walk home!”</p>
<p>“Calm down, good Mis—”</p>
<p>A bit of snow hit Pisces it the face.</p>
<p>“Get them away, I said!”</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the cart rumbled back towards the road and Celum, bereft of any skeletons. But it did have one new passenger: the door lay between Pisces and Ksmvr as the [Mage] pored over it and Ksmvr stared at the small stone in his hands. To the Antinium the rock appeared totally ordinary, which he supposed was the point.</p>
<p>“Now that we have the door, what do you propose we do with it, Pisces?”</p>
<p>“That my friend…is a very good question. I have no idea.”</p>
<p>Pisces looked up for a moment before he went back to staring at the door. Ksmvr noticed the mage’s eyes unfocused as he stared at what the Antinium could only assume was the magic enchantment making up the door. Pisces seemed to be tracing the spell while simultaneously attempting to avoid triggering the door’s automatic teleportation effect.</p>
<p>Every now and then he failed, and would appear on Ksmvr’s lap. The Antinium watched as this happened now. Pisces yelped, popped out of existence on his side of the wagon, and appeared a little bit above Ksmvr. In the ensuing tangle, Pisces fought his way clear.</p>
<p>“Dead gods—<em>give me that!</em>”</p>
<p>He snatched the stone back from the Antinium and placed it on his side of the wagon. A bit of snow flew from the front and hit him on the head.</p>
<p>“Stop doing that! You’re scaring the horses!”</p>
<p>“Shall I reanimate them for you? I’m sure undead horses would be a lot faster than these slow nags.”</p>
<p>Pisces smiled nastily. His reply came in another bit of snow which struck him on the shoulder. Grumbling, Pisces went back to the door.</p>
<p>After a few moments, Ksmvr nodded and spoke up.</p>
<p>“We could make a shield out of it. I could hold it up with comrade Yvlon when fighting spellcasters.”</p>
<p>The young man’s head rose and he stared at Ksmvr.</p>
<p>“Really? That’s your idea?”</p>
<p>Ksmvr nodded, appreciating Pisces’ enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“A shield seems to be the most appropriate use of the door. We could make a harness so Comrade Yvlon could use it in place of her armor. It would protect her back so she would have no need of armor. If an enemy attacked all she would have to do would be to turn around.”</p>
<p>The Antinium paused, waiting for feedback. Pisces just stared at him. After a moment, he cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“I should like to see that. But I believe using the door as any form of personal armament should be employed only as a matter of last resort. Even if you were to block a spell with this door, [Fireball], for instance, the explosion would still affect those hiding behind the door. Any neophyte mage could easily burn you with a low-Tier flame spell were you to use it as cover.”</p>
<p>“Oh. I see.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr felt disappointed. Seeing this, Pisces felt moved to offer him a bone.</p>
<p>“The true value in the door might not be in its practical use at all, but rather as a tool of study for me. I can learn a lot from the enchantments woven into it.”</p>
<p>The Antinium perked up. What helped Pisces was a boon for The Horns of Hammerad.</p>
<p>“Really? Can you copy the spells on the door?”</p>
<p>“Copy?”</p>
<p>Pisces coughed, and then laughed. He shook his head.</p>
<p>“That is far beyond my capabilities.”</p>
<p>“Why? Is it not simply a matter of reproducing the spell? That should be doable with time, should it not?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, [Mage]. What’s wrong? Is it too complex for you?”</p>
<p>Pisces ignored that comment from the front. Sniffing archly, he sat back. He took on the tone Ksmvr had associated with a lecture as he spoke out loud.</p>
<p>“The issue, Ksmvr, is that the nature of magic is not so linear as the philistines might have you think.”</p>
<p>“Hah!”</p>
<p>Again, Pisces ignored the wagon driver’s comment. Ksmvr nodded at him encouragingly. Magic was fascinating to him.</p>
<p>“Indeed?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes. You see, if this door—or should I say, this impressively enchanted self-activating portal device—were simply one enchantment, I dare say even Springwalker would be able to ascertain its nature quite quickly. But it is clearly not one enchantment. And the true exponential difficulty of a spell occurs when multiple layers exist.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr considered Pisces’ explanation and nodded.</p>
<p>“I see. So multiple spells cast on the same object increase the difficulty of analyzing and copying it?”</p>
<p>Pisces deflated somewhat at the Antinium’s calm response.</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>He turned back to the door, frowning at it.</p>
<p>“If it were just something like reinforcement, well, I could do that to a piece of wood, although not with the finesse or force of a true [Enchanter]. They could turn a piece of parchment into something as strong as steel…but as I’ve said magic <em>changes</em> when you layer another spell on top. It truly is quite incredible how many spells are worked into this wood.”</p>
<p>“That is why mages study so continuously?”</p>
<p>“To master the nuance of each spell and understand how magic can change, broadly speaking, yes. Even memorizing spells takes time, and comprehending concepts like spatial travel, well…”</p>
<p>“Can you [Teleport]?”</p>
<p>Pisces ignored that question. He gestured grandly at the door sitting on the back of the wagon.</p>
<p>“This wonder of magical engineering is clearly the work of a master [Mage]. Perhaps even an [Archmage]? Ah, probably not.”</p>
<p>He coughed.</p>
<p>“But studying it will surely raise my level, and it will be a far greater challenge than simply reading from a book of spells. When Springwalker sees this…”</p>
<p>“So you cannot copy the spell?”</p>
<p>Pisces paused, but then he nodded with a rueful smile.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t even dare try. The spells are so tangled up that reproduction is impossible. I’d have to unravel each layer of spells and if that didn’t destroy the entire weaving…no, no, I only intend to study what parts are visible.”</p>
<p>He sighed, losing some of his posturing. Ksmvr nodded.</p>
<p>“I see. Are there some parts which are easier?”</p>
<p>Pisces shrugged, irritated by his moment of genuine expression. He scowled as he bent back over the door, poking at the brass handle.</p>
<p>“The entire thing is a mess. Let me concentrate. It’s hard enough to sit on this bumpy wagon—”</p>
<p>“Watch it, [Mage].”</p>
<p>The wagon driver snapped back at Pisces. He made a face. Ksmvr sat forwards too. The door was just plain, solid wood of course, but now he was very invested in Pisces’ discoveries.</p>
<p>“Surely there are some aspects which are simplest to understand. The triggering mechanism for the spell was analyzing it, was it not?”</p>
<p>“Relatively simple, yes. Of course the part of the spell that detects people investigating it is fiendishly complex. But the trigger component I identified straight off.”</p>
<p>Pisces dismissed that with a wave of the hand. Ksmvr nodded eagerly.</p>
<p>“In that case, would it not be easiest to focus on that part of the spell, knowing the method to activation and outcome?”</p>
<p>In his multi-faceted eyes, the Antinium saw the young man pause. Pisces stared at Ksmvr, and then down at the door. He cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“Uh. Yes. That would be…well, it’s a good place to start as any, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“It is a shame you cannot reverse the effect. That would have been very convenient in the pit.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr meant this only as a segue into asking whether Pisces could teleport him a few times, just so Ksmvr could see what it was like when he wasn’t about to die. But Pisces’ face froze and after a second he burst into a huge and uncharacteristic grin.</p>
<p>Somewhat unnerved, Ksmvr paused as Pisces turned to him. The [Mage] gingerly clapped a hand on Ksmvr’s shoulder. The Antinium stared at the hand. After a moment Pisces let go.</p>
<p>“You, Ksmvr, are clearly a natural-born scholar, as perhaps befits your advanced standing among the Antinium.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Reversing the spell. What a novel idea! And of course the actual binding spell on the stone is ludicrously simple compared to the door. Why, it wouldn’t be hard to reverse—that is to say, to create a trigger to activate the teleportation spell and bring whomever was there to the door! In fact…”</p>
<p>“Does this mean you can teleport me?”</p>
<p>“More than that, my dear Ksmvr. If this means what I think it does—here…you hold this and I shall…”</p>
<p>The Antinium and Human excitedly rocked back and forth on the wagon, jabbering on about ‘possible sequential instances of anchorage’ and ‘activation mechanisms’ and so on. At the head of the wagon, the Adelynn tried not to listen. After a while, she tried to plug her ears with both fingers, but it was hard to do that and guide the wagon. She sighed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You’re late.”</p>
<p>Ceria scowled at Pisces as he and Ksmvr lugged the door over to the front of the Frenzied Hare. The two had attracted quite a lot of attention as they’d dragged and carried it down the street. Now Ksmvr laid the door against the wall of the inn as Pisces panted for breath.</p>
<p>“Don’t blame me. If I could have conjured a few undead we wouldn’t have taken so long! Why no one appreciates the untapped potential of such labor—”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes.”</p>
<p>Ceria sighed, but she stared at the door, mildly impressed Pisces had managed to support his end of it. It was as heavy as it looked, she knew, and it looked <em>heavy.</em></p>
<p>“Is that the door? The magic door?”</p>
<p>Erin stared dubiously at the heavy wood door. It looked as plain as plain could be. She wondered if Pisces and Ceria were playing a prank on everyone else, but Yvlon nodded.</p>
<p>“That’s the door. It doesn’t look like much but—if you could make armor out of it I’d wear it. I saw it take damage that would have shredded my plate armor.”</p>
<p>“Wow.”</p>
<p>No matter how hard Erin stared at it, she just couldn’t see it. But Pisces was clearly excited by the door. He waved his hands at Ceria, talking quickly.</p>
<p>“You won’t believe what I—and Ksmvr I suppose—have discovered! It’s a revolutionary—nay, unprecedented loophole in the spell matrix! I can’t believe it wasn’t covered!”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah? What’s so incredible?”</p>
<p>Ceria looked skeptical. Pisces pointed to the door, grinning broadly, one of the few times Erin had ever seen him happy.</p>
<p>“I managed to isolate the location aspect of the spell. Not only that—I figured out how to trigger it independently of the detection trap.”</p>
<p>Erin’s head swiveled with Yvlon’s towards Ceria. The half-Elf gasped.</p>
<p>“You don’t mean—seriously? And you did it on the ride <em>back? </em>Impossible!”</p>
<p>“Not.”</p>
<p>Pisces was smug. He gestured to the door.</p>
<p>“It all came down to a loophole. If you look around the doorknob—perhaps they didn’t have an adept mastery of enchantments? Or maybe the handle was added too late—either way I forced my way into the bindings from there and…”</p>
<p>He began talking gibberish, or perhaps Erin’s ears just shut down. She gathered that something important had happened by the way Ceria was reacting, but she couldn’t figure out what.</p>
<p>“Are we going to go?”</p>
<p>They had the wagon all ready, and a somewhat surly wagon driver ready to take them to Liscor. Ceria had said they’d be leaving soon. Yvlon shrugged, looking resigned.</p>
<p>“Mages. Give them a minute and then we’ll interrupt.”</p>
<p>Erin nodded. She looked around and frowned.</p>
<p>“Hey, where’s Ksmvr?”</p>
<p>The Antinium was nowhere to be seen. He hadn’t gone inside—had he run off? Erin wanted to ask Pisces—she didn’t want to go have to find Ksmvr as well!—when she heard a <em>pop.</em> Ksmvr appeared in front of the door, holding a small stone in his hands.</p>
<p>Yvlon gasped. Erin jumped and people on the street shouted in surprise. Ksmvr looked around proudly and Pisces broke off from chattering with Ceria to point at him gleefully.</p>
<p>“There, you see?”</p>
<p>“You can <em>teleport</em> to the door?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>In an instant Erin was next to Ksmvr. She stared down at the stone in his hands and then at Pisces.</p>
<p>“How? Where? What?”</p>
<p>“It’s very simple. Actually, it’s not, but I’ll give you a simple explanation. The long and short of it is that we can take advantage of the door’s teleportation spell to teleport to the anchoring stone connected to it—or vice versa.”</p>
<p>Erin pointed at the stone in Ksmvr’s hands.</p>
<p>“You can teleport to that? And teleport back?”</p>
<p>“That’s what I said.”</p>
<p>“How many times?”</p>
<p>Yvlon’s eyes were wide with amazement. Pisces stroked at his chin, shrugging, speaking out loud.</p>
<p>“Any number of times. In time of course the enchantment will lose magic—it requires a huge amount to activate. But here’s the wonderful part—the magic will replenish itself over time!”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Erin was so excited her heart was beating out of her chest. Pisces nodded proudly.</p>
<p>“Quite extraordinary, really. It absorbs the natural mana in the environment—like any acceptably constructed artifact, I suppose—but it allows for practically unlimited uses of the teleportation magic!”</p>
<p>“This is incredible. That changes everything. This thing is—it’s actually <em>useful.</em>”</p>
<p>Ceria murmured as Ksmvr tried to keep people from crowding around the door. She tapped at the wood.</p>
<p>“How much could we sell it for? If you think of it as—as a way to travel, you could get from one end of the city to the other in seconds! Any [Lord] would want it, if only as a novelty.”</p>
<p>“A bit plain for a [Lord]’s door.”</p>
<p>Yvlon put that in, although she looked no less impressed. She ran a hand over the wood surface.</p>
<p>“But paint it and—could we get a hundred gold coins for it, do you suppose?”</p>
<p>“Hundreds? Try thousands. As I was saying, this is incredible! But we need not sell it yet—just imagine the utility of it in a dungeon! We could retreat at any time.”</p>
<p>Pisces was talking faster as he waved his arms about. Ksmvr was proudly showing the stone to people and resisting all attempts of people trying to take it from him. Erin stared down at the door, and an idea seized in her mind. She looked up and spoke loudly.</p>
<p>“I want it.”</p>
<p>Everyone stopped talking. The Horns of Hammerad stared at her. Erin stared back. She pointed at the door.</p>
<p>“I want it. Can I have it?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Pisces was the first to speak. He looked incredulous.</p>
<p>“This door is—as much of a treasure as anything we recovered from Albez. It’s far more useful than a bag of holding. And you want—”</p>
<p>“Yes. I want it.”</p>
<p>Erin didn’t say out loud that the Horns of Hammerad owed her, but they had promised, hadn’t they? They’d said a treasure, and she could think of nothing she would want more than this door. She saw Ceria exchange a glance with the others. Pisces was spluttering.</p>
<p>“You can’t just demand—this is far too sudden to—”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded. She smiled at Erin, and looked at the door.</p>
<p>“For you, Erin? Yes, you can have this…door.”</p>
<p>Yvlon nodded as well.</p>
<p>“We wouldn’t have gotten anywhere if it weren’t for you. And you lent us your gold—twice, now. Of course you can have it.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr nodded as well.</p>
<p>“This seems to be an acceptable form of remuneration. Here is your teleportation stone.”</p>
<p>He handed it to Erin. She held it gingerly. Pisces kept spluttering.</p>
<p>“But—I just got—it was <em>my </em>discovery and—”</p>
<p>“And you did well. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Erin smiled widely at Pisces. He blinked at her and threw his hands up in exasperation.</p>
<p>“Fine. I am outnumbered and overruled by the imposition of what some might call honor or common decency. Take the damned door!”</p>
<p>“I will.”</p>
<p>The young woman patted the door.</p>
<p>“My door.”</p>
<p>Pisces sniffed, clearly upset. Ceria laughed, and slung an arm around his shoulder. He froze up for a second and stared at her. She seemed surprised by the action as well, and released him quickly.</p>
<p>“Cheer up. Erin made a lot of food—and lunch for you two since you missed it. Although I suppose it would be dinner, now.”</p>
<p>Instantly he brightened up.</p>
<p>“Ah, well, I suppose that—”</p>
<p>“<em>—</em>But you’ll have to eat it on the wagon. We’ve got to go now if we want to get to any sort of settlement by nightfall.”</p>
<p>Ceria dragged Pisces back as he headed towards the inn. He complained, but soon he was helping drag the door onto the back of the wagon. Erin turned to help push it further in, and stopped.</p>
<p>A group of people were standing behind her. Miss Agnes, Maran, Safry, Jasi, Grev, Wesle, the [Actors], a number of regular patrons from her inn, Octavia…they stood, smiling at her.</p>
<p>Slowly, Erin stepped towards them. She felt…quite empty inside, really. As if there weren’t any tears to cry. And there weren’t.</p>
<p>There was only a smile. She smiled at them, and went to each one, hugging and kissing Wesle on the cheek and Grev on a dirty forehead, talking and saying goodbye.</p>
<p>But not forever. And so the emptiness in her filled, and when the wagon started to move, Erin could shed a tear. But not a sad tear. She was just so full of memories and happiness that a bit came out anyways.</p>
<p>She sat on the wagon as it rolled out of the city. The Horns of Hammerad sat around her. Friends. Yvlon and Ceria talked animatedly about the play they’d been a part of, recounting the good bits to Ksmvr while Pisces devoured the packed lunch Erin had made for him and Ksmvr.</p>
<p>Erin sat back, and as the cold evening breeze blew past her face, she smiled. A bit sadly.</p>
<p>It was time to go. Celum was…a lovely place. But it wasn’t home. She had to go back to Liscor.</p>
<p>“Goodbye.”</p>
<p>She whispered it to the wind. Not sadly—in her heart she promised to return some day. There was more to this world besides Liscor. And some day she would explore it.</p>
<p>Some day. But for now she was going back. To Mrsha and Selys and even annoying Lyonette. She wanted to go back so desperately it hurt Erin’s chest. But she wouldn’t forget what she’d experienced here.</p>
<p>They rolled out of the city and Erin finally left Celum behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a quiet wagon that&nbsp;slowly rode down the trampled road, slowly moving south. The wagon driver didn’t have a movement Skill, but he was used to the uncertain road and he was skilled and Skilled enough to detect danger. It would take a day – or two or even three – to get to Liscor, but they’d get there, and hopefully without running into any danger.</p>
<p>Erin sat next to the other Horns of Hammerad, not saying anything. At first she’d chatted, but the cold and wind had a way of silencing even the most spirited conversation. And she felt a bit selfish, but she wished—she wished she was back in the Frenzied Hare right now rather than moving around in the cold winter.</p>
<p>If she ever got home, Erin would never complain about an airplane again. That was what she decided.</p>
<p>“Anyone want dinner?”</p>
<p>“It’s cold.”</p>
<p>Pisces grumbled as he lay sprawled out on the wagon. Ceria, sitting next to his foot, shifted it aside irritably.</p>
<p>“I could warm it up with magic. So could you.”</p>
<p>“I would much rather have stayed the night in the inn in the city. If we had left the next day—”</p>
<p>“If we had, we’d be that much behind. I want to get moving while the roads are clear.”</p>
<p>Ceria pointed that out acerbically. But from the way she glanced back at Celum, still visible in the distance, Erin knew she felt the same.</p>
<p>“After all my hard work with the door, I am resigned to this. A cold meal on wagon back. Truly, gratitude is a foreign concept among even the staunchest of comrades.”</p>
<p>Pisces sat up, grumbling. Erin wanted to grumble back at him, but she was grateful for the door, really. He really was a genius, just like Ceria sometimes said. So she’d let him grumble a bit more.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do with the door, Erin?”</p>
<p>Yvlon asked that, wrapped up in her coat. Erin had to think.</p>
<p>“I’ll probably put the door somewhere in the city! It’ll be so cool! I can pop in and visit Selys all the time, and I’ll get so many visitors since it’ll be easy to get to my inn!”</p>
<p>“Not to mention it’ll be safer since you can get away if there’s a monster attack.”</p>
<p>The woman nodded approvingly. Pisces just sniffed.</p>
<p>“What a waste.”</p>
<p>“What would you do with it, then?”</p>
<p>“Certainly not use it to for a simple walk of a few minutes. Why, with a door so useful I’d link it to a safe space—perhaps far underground. Or perhaps as a trap to deter unwelcome visitors. I could fix it so that at your command anyone unsavory was transported deep underground—”</p>
<p>“You can send people that far?”</p>
<p>Erin was surprised. All the Horns of Hammerad nodded, looking grim. Ceria kicked the door and cursed as she winced in pain.</p>
<p>“The door teleported us to a pit trap when we first found it. And like Pisces said, it recovers magic. So it won’t run out. It’s a great tool for you, Erin. I’m glad we can give it to you.”</p>
<p>Erin nodded, but her heart had suddenly jolted in her chest. She took a breath, trying to contain the excitement trying to explode out of her body in case she was wrong.</p>
<p>“Well, if this door is so powerful, it can probably teleport people a long way away, right?”</p>
<p>“Any [Teleport] spell can do that.”</p>
<p>Pisces murmured as he tried to get himself comfortable in his spot in the wagon. He pointed at Erin.</p>
<p>“You were there when that objectionable Gazi teleported away, were you not? Her spell took her far away. Across the ocean, I’ll wager. Thousands of miles. True, that was with a customized spell for long-distance, but a normal [Teleportation] spell can still cover many miles, albeit at increased mana cost.”</p>
<p>“So this door—”</p>
<p>“—Is clearly a relic of a past pinnacle of magical achievement. Indeed, that entire room—the private hidden store room of a powerful mage—was filled with wonders. Putting aside the mediocre traps preceding the door, the pit trap was truly a death sentence even for a Named Adventurer. If all the [Insanity] runes had been active, I cannot imagine any Skill or spell short of…Tier 7 that would have saved you from an untimely end.”</p>
<p>“Wow.”</p>
<p>Erin shivered a bit, realizing how dangerous it had been. But she pressed forwards anyways.</p>
<p>“So this door is incredible because it can teleport people really far. And it recovers magic. So…”</p>
<p>“So what?”</p>
<p>Ceria looked at Erin blankly. The girl paused, and then pointed to the stone in Ksmvr’s hand.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t we just leave that in Celum? If we made another door or something, couldn’t we travel back and forth to the wagon? And once it gets to Liscor, I mean, I don’t know if it’s too far, but could I use it as a door to…”</p>
<p>Her voice trailed off. Everyone on the wagon—including the wagon driver—was staring at Erin with an open mouth. Pisces closed his.</p>
<p>“Remarkable. And of course it would work. The charge might not last for more than one or two mass teleportations per day but if you found a way to recover mana—”</p>
<p>“Ksmvr!”</p>
<p>Ksmvr shot to his feet.</p>
<p>“I will go to the city.”</p>
<p>“Hold on! Let me tune the stone. I had it so you would teleport with it. But clearly we need to…hm…”</p>
<p>Pisces and Ceria clustered around the stone, arguing with each other as Yvlon, Ksmvr, and Erin watched with bated breath. In a few moments Ksmvr was jumping off the wagon and running quite quickly back towards the city in the distance.</p>
<p>The others settled back in the wagon to wait. They didn’t speak much—just watched Ksmvr’s shape slowly disappear. The minutes felt like hours, and after an interminable number of them had passed, Yvlon coughed.</p>
<p>“Been a while. Ksmvr should have made it to the city by now. Do you think it didn’t—”</p>
<p><em>Pop.</em> Ksmvr appeared back on the wagon. Everyone shouted, but he raised his hands.</p>
<p>“The stone is at the Frenzied Hare. I have explained to Miss Agnes but she does not quite understand. Shall we attempt to return now?”</p>
<p>“Yes. All we have to do is—”</p>
<p>From his seat on the wagon, the driver half-turned to look. He caught only a glimpse of the five people clustered around the door lying on his wagon when he heard a quiet <em>pop </em>of air and they vanished.</p>
<p>The horses, pulling the wagon, snorted in surprise when they felt the sudden change in weight. For his part, the wagon driver stared at the spot in dismay.</p>
<p>What was he supposed to do? Keep driving? While these adventurers feasted in the inn? That wasn’t fair!</p>
<p>But it was what he was paid for, so after a moment the wagon driver urged his horses on, scowling. He drew his scarf tightly around his face as the night grew closer around him.</p>
<p>The poor wagon driver sat miserably hunched over in the cart as the horses plodded onwards through the cold night. After a few moments, the door opened on the wagon. The wagon driver gaped as from out of the wagon a girl stepped out with a sudden outpouring of noise—and heat!</p>
<p>She stepped <em>up,</em> since the door was lying on its back, but somehow was facing the right way when she stood upright on the wagon.</p>
<p>“Woog. That’s trippy.”</p>
<p>She muttered as she held something in her hands. The wagon driver stared at her. The girl—was her name Erin?—smiled at him. She held out what was in her hands. The man looked and saw a steaming bowl of soup.</p>
<p>“It’s fresh! Sorry about the wait—Pisces said he could actually make the door connect! Don’t ask me how—he put the stone, you know, the anchor-thingy? He put it in another door and he and Ceria did some magic to it and look! Portal door!”</p>
<p>The man just stared at her. Slowly, he took the bowl of soup. It did indeed smell fresh, and the hot liquid warmed his cold hands and soul in the winter night.</p>
<p>“I’m making popcorn as well. I’ll bring you some when I’m done! Do you want something to drink with that?”</p>
<p>The man brightened up. The girl opened the door, stepped <em>down</em> and into the inn and the door closed. After a few more minutes, the door opened and popcorn was handed over in a bowl along with a big mug of ale. The man stared down at the white, fluffy kernels seasoned with butter, salt, and yeast—which was the only way to eat popcorn, or so Erin claimed. He tried some, and cheered up even more.</p>
<p>And so the wagon plodded onwards, bearing its curious load. It traveled down the silent, winter roads, slowly heading south. To a city claimed by Drakes, Gnolls, and the strange Antinium. To Liscor. To a place known as The Wandering Inn.</p>
<p>To home.</p>

		<p><em>When he was young, he had always dreamed of walking among other races. But now all he dreamed about was death and fire. The Goblin King burned city after city to the ground, damning the screaming inhabitants by death and fire. Across the ocean, his Goblin Lords led similar crusades, pillaging, slaughtering.</em></p>
<p><em>There was only war. The peace he had sought for so long was a false lie. That was what the King realized. His armies burned across the continent, fighting Drakes, Undead, Antinium, Gnolls and Humans alike. They could not be stopped. There was only death in his heart, and the fury to destroy the world. With it he slew the greatest of heroes they sent against him.</em></p>
<p><em>Rage. All consuming. It burned him and he howled it as his warriors fought and died and leveled. He would kill them all.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>—-</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>And then Rags woke. She started, still tasting smoke and blood, still full of the Goblin King’s fury. She slipped and nearly fell—the Carn Wolf she sat on shifted and Rags clung to its fur, eliciting a mild noise of complaint. But it had been trained too well to protest.</p>
<p>In a moment, Rags was sitting upright. She blinked around and realized that they’d stopped. After nearly two weeks of nonstop marching, they had arrived.</p>
<p>Where, exactly?</p>
<p>The young Goblin sat up on her mount, letting it—him—pace restlessly ahead. She was riding in the center of the army.</p>
<p>Her army, supposedly. Rags frowned as she looked around. As ever, a group of Hobs walked with her, as did several of Garen’s elite wolf riders. And past them?</p>
<p>A sea of Goblin heads flowed past Rags, and the noise of their passing washed over her. Goblins were by and large fairly quiet as a people; they preferred gestures to words and they had learned to be quiet long ago, lest they attract attention.</p>
<p>But thousands of marching Goblins, armored warriors who rattled with every step, noncombatants who carried packs, horses and mules and donkeys, animals liberated from Human farms, and Goblin infants, uncharacteristically quiet for babies but still occasionally noisy—all produced a din of their own.</p>
<p>It was an army worthy of any Chieftain. More than worthy, in fact. Rags knew her own forces, that was to say the former tribes she had personally subjugated and now controlled, were mixed into the lot. But she only commanded the huge mass. The assembled Goblins were not <em>hers</em>, and that was an important distinction.</p>
<p>Still, they didn’t fight or quarrel, and that was important. Disunity could be death here, in the heart of Human lands.</p>
<p>Not that there were any around. Rags looked and saw only trees. They’d been marching through a forest full of annoying trees with burrs the size of walnuts that clung to clothing and pierced skin with their sharp needles. Tall stone loomed ahead of her, and snow mixed with rotting leaves lay underfoot. Only the trees, brown and lifeless, made any impression on the landscape.</p>
<p>They were close to the mountain. Rags stared up at it grimly, knowing they had to be close. This was their destination, after all.</p>
<p>Long ago the flat grasslands had given way to forests and hills, and then to an area of rocky land where a lone mountain sat high above everything else.</p>
<p>It wasn’t much of a mountain to Rags, who’d grown up in the shadows of the High Passes, staring up at peaks so tall that no one had ever climbed them. But the mountain was their destination, and it seemed that after staring up at it for days, they’d finally reached the base of it.</p>
<p>Rags sat astride the large Carn Wolf and stared up at the massive cliff face that met the edge of the forest. She had no idea why they were here, so far from home. Well, she had some idea, but Garen Redfang had been reluctant to tell anyone his full plan when he’d told them where to go when they marched north.</p>
<p>Perhaps she should have argued harder. But Rags had known at the time that he was right. It was just that she couldn’t stand the long days of not knowing what was going on! The assembled tribes needed an ally in their war against the Goblin Lord, that she knew. But would they find it here, near Invrisil, where adventurers roamed in great numbers and slew any monster they found?</p>
<p>Rags hoped so. Or else they would all die here. She shivered in the cold and drew the fur coat more tightly around her. She remembered. This was not a memory of times long past; it was her memory, fresh and vivid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Goblin army was a black mass that swarmed up the walls of the Human city, climbing ladders, fighting with the Human defenders among the broken gates.</em></p>
<p><em>Black armor. That was what set these Goblins apart from ordinary rabble. Also, no tribe would have dared to attack a Human city. But these Goblins did not fear the burning fire and lightning that the enchantments on the walls spat down at them. Their arrows flew upwards, catching the mages who tried to burn the dark shafts out of the air.</em></p>
<p><em>Humans fell and died. It was simply that there were not enough of them to man the walls and stem the black tide that attacked from every direction. This was a Goblin army, superior in numbers to any other force.</em></p>
<p><em>The knot of desperate men and women slowly grew smaller around the north gate. Soon the Goblins would gain a foothold there, and then they would be in the city, too late to stop.</em></p>
<p><em>Now was the time. Rags raised her hand.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Now.</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The first wave of Goblins hit the black armored Goblins at the same time as the rain of arrows and crossbow bolts fell from the sky. Elite Goblins mounted on Carn Wolves tore into the unguarded backs of the Goblin Lord’s forces, causing havoc while Hobs strode next to their smaller kin, besieging the bewildered Goblin force from behind.</em></p>
<p><em>From where she sat Rags smiled grimly. The Goblin Lord’s forces hadn’t expected to be attacked, much less by their own kind.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Crush them against the walls.</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Rags ordered more forces into the fight, reinforcing places where her forces were weak. But there wasn’t much for her to do; she’d already positioned countless archers and her Goblins armed with crossbows where they could rain death down upon the Goblins.</em></p>
<p><em>They were outnumbered in truth. But Rags’ forces were aided by the Humans fighting on the walls and the fact that they’d cornered the Goblin Lord here. And one more thing ensured their victory.</em></p>
<p><em>“Redfang! Redfang!”</em></p>
<p><em>A streak of crimson. A Goblin warrior sitting astride a huge wolf. Garen Redfang’s warriors howled as they plunged into the ranks of the enemy, following their leader. Rags watched Garen carving his way through the enemy, feeling both jealous and relieved at the same time.</em></p>
<p><em>They were on the same side, and she knew he belonged at the front. But she wished she could be fighting too, rather than stuck overseeing the battle.</em></p>
<p><em>And yet, this was it. Rags watched, viciously pleased as the Goblins in black armor began to rout. They’d done it. They’d won!</em></p>
<p><em>But where was the Goblin Lord? Rags hadn’t seen anyone remotely like a leader in the army—at least, not like the image in her head. She’d expected a warrior like Garen, or a spellcaster full of magical power. But she hadn’t seen anyone like that. Perhaps the Goblin Lord was like her?</em></p>
<p><em>Below her, Goblins fled. Goblins died. But Rags could feel little pity for these invaders who wore another tribe’s colors. She had seen what they left in their wake. These Goblins slaughtered villages, put crops to the torch. They were destroyers, not scavengers. They didn’t fight to survive, they fought to kill and pillage.</em></p>
<p><em>And rape. She had seen that too. So Rags cut down the stragglers and wiped this army from the face of the map. And as she stood with her small band of guards witnessing the last of the violence, she felt uncertain. Because the battle was won, but she didn’t know if the Goblin Lord had survived the battle.</em></p>
<p><em>Her answer came when Garen rode towards her, covered in blood, still wild-eyed from the adrenaline pumping in his veins. Rags strode towards him. She was nearly hopping with impatience.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Goblin Lord. Where?</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>She wanted Garen to say he’d killed the Lord. But Garen just stared at her strangely.</em></p>
<p><em>“This was not the Goblin Lord’s army. This was just one of his warbands.”</em></p>
<p><em>And then the ground fell out from beneath Rags. She stared at the devastation, at the Human city broken by this army. But it was not a true victory for this was only a fraction of her enemy’s strength. She had underestimated the power of a Lord and so for the first time—</em></p>
<p><em>She felt fear.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A warband. Rags shivered at the thought. Or maybe it was just because she was cold. She sneezed and wiped her hand on the Carn Wolf’s fur. That was the convenient thing about riding the wolf, for all they were hard on the butt and bounced Rags about. Their fur was nice and easy to wipe hands and feet clean on, although the wolves tended to bite if they noticed you doing it.</p>
<p>Perhaps a Human – like Erin – would have just shrugged and said ‘so what?’ upon hearing that this was a Goblin warband. But Goblins understood how their kind made war. There was a simple, almost instinctual way they organized, and so from this Rags understood the dangers of the Goblin Lord’s main force.</p>
<p>No one had ever taught Rags about percentages, so she thought of it like this. Goblin armies were always a huge mass, but they always fragmented their forces in order to attack most efficiently. Around two thirds would constitute the main force which moved slowly from place to place, devouring and razing everything in its path. But the remaining third would break down into warbands and raiding parties that spread out in the path of the main army, seizing supplies, recruiting other Goblin tribes, and clashing with smaller forces.</p>
<p>A warband constituted around a tenth of the actual army’s force, so that it could be easily replaced if lost. The same went for raiding parties, which were less than a hundredth of the size of the actual army. But what that meant was that if this warband Rags’ forces had crushed numbered in the thousands, the Goblin Lord’s army numbered in the tens of thousands.</p>
<p>All together, the combined tribes of the High Passes numbered little less than two thousand warriors. Rags had known in an instant what would happen if they were to lead their forces against such a huge enemy. Any Goblin could figure that out, really.</p>
<p>Except maybe Garen Redfang. He thought they could skirmish with the Goblin Lord’s forces, but that was because he was used to a small tribe with groups of elite mounted warriors. If all the Goblins tried that they would be very dead, very quickly.</p>
<p>So Rags had ordered their forces north, against Garen’s objections, to buy time. It had taken some doing but she’d pointed out the obvious to the surly Goblin Chieftain. If the combined tribes around the High Passes were equivalent to one of the Goblin Lord’s warbands, they had no hope of facing his main force.</p>
<p>So, north. Surprisingly, once Garen had accepted the idea he had been the one to lead them to this spot. He claimed to know where another Goblin tribe was based, one strong enough to help fight the Goblin Lord.</p>
<p>It had been a long journey, although not necessarily a difficult one. Rags had been more concerned with affairs inside the tribe rather than any external threat. The most exciting thing that had happened had been when they’d spotted the magical carriage. But it had gotten away.</p>
<p>And the trip had been helpful for Rags in another way. She’d gotten to know her tribe better—that was to say, she now knew who was loyal to her and who was not. And she’d gotten stronger.</p>
<p>Rags had leveled many times over the journey. Not so much as a [Mage] or [Tinkerer], and certainly not as her old class – [Scavenger]. But through Garen’s intense training she’d leveled up as a [Warrior], gained two levels as a [Tactician], and more than ten as a [Leader]. Soon, the other Chieftains told her, her [Leader] class would turn into a [Chieftain] class, unique to their race.</p>
<p>That was the good bit. But Rags knew the bad bit started and ended with one simple fact: somehow, in some way, she’d suddenly lost her position as leader over all the tribes. Not that she’d ruled over all the tribes to begin with—this was a coalition army. But…</p>
<p>She was <em>not</em> in command here. In battles, yes. The few times the Goblins had had to defend themselves all the other Chieftains had obeyed her orders quickly and without complaint, as had their warriors. But they were not here, joining together because of Rags. And it was not her authority they respected.</p>
<p>It was his.</p>
<p>Garen Redfang appeared out of the trees, riding his huge rust-red Carn Wolf mount. Rags pulled at her wolf’s head gently, forcing it to slow down. She stared up at Garen, and not for the first time, resented his physique.</p>
<p><em>He </em>looked like what all Goblins dreamed of being. Garen was strong. His muscles stood out on his bare chest and he looked like he barely noticed the cold. He was covered in scars, he had a magical sword at his side and a mighty beast under his command—he looked like a proper Chieftain, not Rags.</p>
<p>That was the problem.</p>
<p>Garen Redfang and his tribe were under Rags’ command. She had beaten his tribe, and so it was part of hers now. That was how it went, but somehow Garen had made a mess of that simple fact.</p>
<p>He had lost, but somehow, he <em>hadn’t</em> lost. Rags knew he’d thrown the fight, but a defeat was a defeat in Goblin society. She should have taken his tribe and obtained his unquestioning loyalty unless he challenged her.</p>
<p>But he didn’t obey. Garen glanced down at Rags and smiled. But not just in greeting—there was something <em>patronizing</em> about his smile, and indeed his attitude. It was as if he was obeying Rags because it was convenient, not because she was Chieftain.</p>
<p>Frankly, it made Rags furious. She jumped off her mount to give her stiff legs a chance to move. She glared up at Garen, ignoring the way his wolf sniffed at her. If it licked her, she’d punch it in the nose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Report.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He blinked at her, almost as if he was surprised by her tone. But he answered her casually.</p>
<p>“We are here. This is the place where the other tribe lives.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rags glanced around the miserable little forest. This was hardly the place she’d have chosen for a tribe. But Garen just nodded.</p>
<p>“Here. In the Human lands.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>They are strong?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rags wanted to know all the details he’d withheld from her. But her question seemed to amuse Garen. He laughed loudly, and she flushed. Other Goblins would watch them talk! Garen hadn’t dismounted. Did he not understand how to behave in front of his own Chieftain?</p>
<p>Garen pointed at the mountain.</p>
<p>“There. There is where they live. And they are strong, yes.”</p>
<p>He raised his voice. Rags saw Goblins’ heads turn as he spoke loudly. Garen gestured to the sky.</p>
<p>“This is the land where Goblins are strongest. The Humans have built grand cities and their adventurers fight with all monsters. But the Goblins remain, and fight. This is the place where Goblins are <em>mighty</em>.”</p>
<p>Rags had never heard of the tribes living to the north. But she had never ventured out of the area around Liscor, never known more than her miserable existence in her small tribe before this. She looked at Garen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strongest Goblins live here?</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>He shrugged, as if he actually wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>“On this continent. Aside from Goblin Lord. Others live across the sea. On islands. They are strong too. But here? Yes.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Across the sea?</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>There were other Goblins on other continents? Rags couldn’t imagine it. But Garen nodded. He had seen the world Rags couldn’t imagine.</p>
<p>“Some live on Terandria, but fewer. Some on Chandrar too; strong tribes, that live in their own places. Few on Baleros. Fewer still on Rhir. Too much death there. Overwhelming death.”</p>
<p>One of the worst kinds of death. Rags shuddered. Garen nodded darkly, baring his teeth in a scowl.</p>
<p>“We live in other places. But the enemies find us wherever we go. The last Goblin King came across sea. Many did. They fought greater enemies than Drakes and Gnolls and Humans.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>But tribe here. It is—</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rags hesitated. Inwardly, she cursed the fact that she still couldn’t speak the common language like Garen could. The Goblin tongue was so…so…<em>hard</em> to use! There were countless words for death, but few words for what she needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>It is strong? Leader is strong? Will help?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“He is. And he may help. We will see.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How?</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Garen shrugged. Rags wanted to punch him, but he sat too high up. He looked towards the mountain and nodded to Rags.</p>
<p>“I will go. To prepare. You follow.”</p>
<p>That wasn’t what was supposed to happen. Rags was supposed to order him to do that, not the other way around! She opened her mouth to shout that at Garen, but he was already wheeling his wolf, letting it lope towards the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>Disgusted, Rags watched him ride away, already calling out to other Chieftains and his warriors. Not good. She was losing more control over him each day, she felt. &nbsp;What would happen if she lost what control she had left? She didn’t know, but she feared the result, especially as she prepared herself to meet this new Chieftain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goblin politics. As Headscratcher and the band of Redfang warriors had observed, the situation between Rags and Garen Redfang was anything but ordinary. The Flooded Waters tribe, Rags’ tribe, was the largest tribe in the coalition of fifteen or so tribes by a good margin. And the strongest, Rags felt.</p>
<p>They had nearly eight hundred warriors and several thousand Goblins in total, and over <em>ten</em> Hobs, the most out of any tribe by far. And yet, Rags didn’t count the Redfang tribe when she thought of her tribe. They were with the Flooded Waters tribe, but like Garen, they were separate.</p>
<p>He still gave orders to his tribe, although it was Rags who made sure the warriors were fed. She’d taken over, organized them efficiently and taken the burden off of Garen’s beleaguered Hobs, who’d had to do all the work because their Chieftain was a terrible leader when it came to such matters. And yet, if it came down to it, Rags was fairly certain they’d listen to Garen and not her if they butted heads.</p>
<p>Not good. Garen had lost, but he didn’t seem to regard losing as being less superior in any way. Normally, Rags would have killed or exiled him for disobeying her orders, but she couldn’t because Garen was too strong. If she challenged him, he would beat her easily. Ordinarily Rags would have just sneered and had several Hobs beat him up—a Chieftain ruled by more than just force!—but Garen was quite capable of taking down any number of Hobs she sent at him.</p>
<p>And if she used her Goblins, his tribe would defend him. And if Rags made it a battle between tribes, it wouldn’t end until one side was dead and the other crippled. And if that happened, the other Chieftains in this tenuous alliance of tribes would choose sides and either way, it would end in disaster.</p>
<p>This Rags knew, but she didn’t <em>like</em> it. She could only grit her teeth and bear the humiliation and slights Garen offered her seemingly without thought. He was too strong.</p>
<p>She didn’t have to order anyone to follow Garen. He rode off with his warriors and the other Goblins followed. Grumpily, Rags left her wolf—another Goblin would ride it if they could get on without it biting them—and strode off.</p>
<p>She needed to know things. What things? <em>Anything</em>. Garen had told her nothing. But who could she ask? Telling other Chieftains she couldn’t command Garen was as good as shooting herself with her black crossbow, Rags knew. She had to ask someone from her tribe. But who?</p>
<p>Rags had conquered four tribes with her small one. She had made all of them hers, and she knew most of them thought of her as a proper Chieftain. At least two tribes did. One was…well, she’d absorbed them only a few days before meeting the Redfang tribe, and so she hadn’t gained as complete control over them as the others. They respected Garen’s strength more than her cunning.</p>
<p>But it was the Chieftains Rags thought about, the former Chieftains, that was. They were hers, too. Chieftains were smart, some of them, and some knew a lot. So could she ask one of them?</p>
<p>Rags thought. The first tribe she’d attacked was…the Rockjaw tribe. She’d killed their leader herself. Oops.</p>
<p>Well, he was out. What about the second tribe? The Still Grass tribe’s leader was alive, but he was young like her. And like Rags, he had risen to power early and his tribe was weak, only having had one Hob when she’d crushed it. She doubted he knew anything of the world.</p>
<p>The third tribe was the least loyal to her, the Fire Bite tribe. Their Chieftain, a Hob, was hard to control. Rags couldn’t talk to him.</p>
<p>She ground her sharp teeth together. But wait! There was one last tribe.</p>
<p>The Gold Stone Tribe. Rags hesitated. She’d conquered them literally seconds before the Redfang Tribe had attacked, but to their credit, their Chieftain had instantly thrown all of his support behind Rags like a proper Goblin, when backstabbing her would have led to her instant demise.</p>
<p>Could she trust him? Rags closed her eyes and remembered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Rags didn’t even see him swing his sword. She only saw the Hob next to her move, and then </em><em>the Gold Stone Chieftain was in front of her, taking the one-handed slash meant for Rags.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, she could trust him. Rags opened her eyes and blinked rapidly. For a second she was still in the past, heart beating rapidly as she stared up at Garen Redfang, sure this was the end. Then she was back in the present, standing on muddy ground as Goblins walked past her.</p>
<p>It was getting easier to do that. Rags had found recalling past events was simpler now that her tribe had grown. She still couldn’t ‘look’ back that far in time, but what she could see was easier, and she could will the visions to happen most of the time.</p>
<p>And it helped in matters like these. Rags began walking through the snow. She didn’t have to search to find the Gold Stone Tribe’s former Chieftain. He was part of her tribe and assigned to managing them on the march, being the most competent Hob at the job.</p>
<p>She found the Gold Stone Chieftain munching on something as he rested near a tree. He was waiting for the Goblins around him to keep moving forwards—Rags had passed by a pile of Goblins. One idiot had slipped and the others had all fallen down because of that.</p>
<p>Rags eyed the former Chieftain as he chewed contentedly, scratching at his belly. He was a classical Hob, fat, trusting in his extra body mass to shield him as much as his armor. But like all Hobs he was strong and Rags knew he was fairly good with an axe and shield.</p>
<p>She was about to yell at him for eating—it wasn’t meal time! Hobs had to respect her rules and stay away from the rations, the same as everyone else. But then she saw what he was eating.</p>
<p>Pine needles. The Hob was chewing them down slowly, letting the sharp tufts stick out of his mouth. He had a handful of the green needles and, as Rags watched, he shoved some more into his mouth.</p>
<p>She had to admire that. The pine needles were easy to get on the march, and it was a good snack. If you could handle the pricking, that was. She saw several other Goblins around the Chieftain trying to imitate him and spitting out the sharp pine needles after a few moments. But the Gold Stone Chieftain just chewed determinedly, grinding the tough fibers into mush.</p>
<p>He turned as Rags marched over. The Gold Stone Chieftain nodded his head towards her—Rags felt better about that. It wasn’t as if Goblins had to salute her or bow, but they did acknowledge their Chieftain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You. Question.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was all she said. As far as she knew, the Gold Stone Chieftain had no name. His tribe had no [Shaman] – they were rare – and so he lacked a name. She just thought of him as the Gold Stone Chieftain, which might be how he thought of himself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chieftain.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>His voice was a rumble. The Gold Stone Chieftain said that word and nothing else. He just chewed his food, waiting for her to say something.</p>
<p>Rags pursed her lips, trying to figure out how to ask her question concisely. She could speak in the Human, or rather, common tongue, but it hurt her throat to try. She pointed at the mountain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This place. Tribe. Is strong?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a question with a lot of nuance, which Garen should have understood when Rags asked him. The Gold Stone Chieftain heard Rags’ question and the layers beneath it. Properly translated, her stance, the context in which she was asking and the current state of the tribes meant she was really asking: ‘How dangerous is this tribe? Are they likely to betray us? Why has Garen taken us here, and what can I expect?’</p>
<p>At last, the Gold Stone Chieftain nodded. Rags waited with bated breath for his response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is strong Goblin. Goblins here is strong.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was the problem with other Goblins, even other Chieftains. None of them were particularly verbose, which made sense given their language. All he was telling her was that the Chieftain was as strong as his tribe, which was apparently very. She eyed him dourly, and the Hob shrugged as if apologizing.</p>
<p>Talking wasn’t his strong suit. Rags turned to go, deciding she’d have to figure out what to do herself. But she heard a grunt, and then a rumble, and words in a language that was not Goblin.</p>
<p>“Chieftain. You. Chieftain?”</p>
<p>She turned, eyes widening. The Gold Stone Chieftain stared at her pensively. For a second, white-hot fury flared up in Rags’ chest and she debated taking the shortsword from her belt and stabbing him with it.</p>
<p>But she didn’t. It was a question, not an attack. Rags was so angry she didn’t reply in Goblin, but again in the common language.</p>
<p>“I…Chieftain. I always…Chieftain!”</p>
<p>She glared at him. The Gold Stone Chieftain met her eyes—not afraid, just searchingly. Then he bowed his head and nodded slowly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is so. Will not ask again.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She stared at him, but the Hob just went back to chewing his pine needles. Rags looked around. Other Goblins immediately bowed their heads and pretended to be busy kicking snow, picking nostrils, or throwing prickly burrs at each other. But they had heard.</p>
<p>Was the Gold Stone Chieftain questioning her too? No—as Rags left and calmed down she considered what had been said. He’d questioned her, yes, but when she’d declared herself as Chieftain he’d acknowledged her in front of the others.</p>
<p>Maybe, just maybe, she had one supporter she could count on. The other Hobs were loyal to her as well, but she had known they could turn on her if dissatisfied, as one of them had when they were losing to the Redfang Tribe. But the Gold Stone Chieftain…could she count on him?</p>
<p>Rags didn’t know. But then she found herself striding up to the mountain, and saw where Goblins were streaming into fissures in the stone, caves leading into the mountain. She walked upwards and found herself in another world, in the heart of a small kingdom of Goblins. And there she met the one who called himself Great Chieftain, the Chieftain above all others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her cold feet left snowy tracks that melted on the rough stone floor of the city within a mountain. Rags saw other Goblins stumbling on the rough ground; though places had been worn smooth, this was no place of architecture and masonry. The vast tunnel they walked down had been hewn out of the very rock one chip at a time.</p>
<p>By degrees, the darkness of the caverns lightened, as bits of fire appeared overhead, lighting the way. Lanterns hung from rough hemp rope or were strapped to lengths of wood dangled off of balconies, sputtering with the cheap animal fat oil.</p>
<p>The smoke of such flames drifted upwards, to the walkways made out of stone and the bridges of rope and timber where dark shapes scurried about. Upwards, and ever upwards the Goblins looked, for the crisscrossing tunnels and passages led up into the heart of the mountain.</p>
<p>At first, they saw the guards, hidden in alcoves or behind barricades disguised as piled stone. Arrows glinted, but the Goblins watched them carefully without putting any to their bows. They wore steel armor which made even some Hobs look on in jealousy.</p>
<p>Next, they saw other Goblins dragging in a dead bear’s carcass, and next to it, the cub, both riddled with arrows. A rat darted out of the shadows to lick at the trail of blood. Another Goblin grabbed the rat, and a few of the roaches which clung to a wall. All things lived here, and all things were eaten.</p>
<p>Upwards, then, traversing stone steps and an open bridge where bat droppings had made footing treacherous. Goblins carrying wood – both firewood and quality pieces cut for the purposes of crafting passed them by, heads bowed, moving fast. There was a rhythm to this place, and a structure.</p>
<p>Then they passed by the huge furnaces which expelled black smoke upwards and felt warmer. The Goblins and Rags saw how the embers in this place never died, being fed coal and wood almost constantly to warm the cavern. And from the fire all things came. Meat was cooked and food made with embers taken from that massive blaze, and metal hammered or the crudest of reforgings done by Goblin [Blacksmiths], whom Rags had never seen before.</p>
<p>And then they reached the heart of the city, and Rags gazed in wonder at the buildings. For after centuries of neglect and habitation by Goblins, the former city of stone still showed traces of what it had been.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was Dwarves who carved into this place, building grand monuments and smoothing the stone. But it was Goblins who broke down windows and walls and strung bridges and rope everywhere that they might travel more easily. As Rags watched, a Goblin climbed higher, headed towards a ledge higher up that led into another passage. The Goblin’s grip slipped as he or she reached for the next part of the rope. They tried to stabilize themselves, failed.</p>
<p>The small body fell, and was soon dragged away.</p>
<p>“This is the hall of the Great Chieftain of the North.”</p>
<p>That was all Garen Redfang said as Rags walked with him. She stood with him and all the Chieftains of the allied tribes at the head of their army. Most of the other Goblins had stayed behind—going somewhere else—but hundreds still followed the Chieftains, warriors and other Hobs, going to the heart of this place.</p>
<p>Where else could it be but the throne room? Here Rags saw the places meant for statues, smashed and turned instead into more places for Goblins to move about freely. But there was still a majesty to the double doors that stood wide, and as she entered the huge hall, she saw the Chieftain of this place.</p>
<p>It was just a glimpse. Rags saw him past the tables and detritus of the room, sitting on a throne of cloth and dirty pillows. A fat, huge Goblin twice as large as any Hob. &nbsp;But her eye was drawn to the long tables, the seats made out of stone that had been dragged up here. This was no throne room after all, but a banquet hall.</p>
<p>And there were Goblins in it, enough for a feast. But Rags didn’t think there was going to be any party, unless it was the bloody kind.</p>
<p>These Goblins were ready for war. They stood next to the dais and the huge Goblin Chieftain, armed warriors, equal in number or perhaps a little more than the Goblins that had entered with Rags and Garen at their head.</p>
<p>Rags immediately noticed the quality of these Goblin’s arms. Steel, again, or iron. Some wore complete sets of plate armor, scavenged from some adventurer’s corpse. Others held swords which glowed—they had magical weapons!</p>
<p>And Hobs. There were a lot of them. Rags blinked as she saw tall Goblins, standing next to their smaller bretheren. So many! She counted over thirty before she stopped, and there were far more in the room. Far more.</p>
<p>By that standard alone these Goblins were superior to the trespassers. And it clearly was a message: we are better than you. We are stronger. For all that, Rags felt that Garen’s Redfang warriors were no less powerful than the best of the warriors who stood assembled here. And of course none of the Goblins could match the legendary Garen Redfang, not the mightiest Hob warrior among them.</p>
<p>Except perhaps their leader. Rags fixed on him as she walked slowly forwards with Garen. The massive Goblin had not bothered to stand; she wondered if he could, fat as he was. But his huge head as was intent as he stared at her. Rags shuddered as she saw his crimson eyes looking towards her, and she sensed his authority. But then the Chieftain’s eyes fixed on Garen.</p>
<p>Garen stopped two thirds of the way into the room, and the Goblins stopped behind him. Rags walked past Garen, which made him frown in annoyance. She ignored that; she <em>was</em> the Chieftain, after all.</p>
<p>The huge Chieftain’s eyes flicked to Rags for a second, and his lips moved upwards in amusement. But he looked back at Garen. While Rags was wondering what to say, his huge mouth opened and he spoke.</p>
<p>“Garen Redfang. It has been long since you trespassed in my lands.”</p>
<p>Rags jumped in surprise. He was speaking in the common language! And fluently! Even Garen didn’t speak like that!</p>
<p>And he had addressed Garen. Rags glared. She had to reply back, teach this arrogant Chieftain who the real leader was.</p>
<p>But then Garen spoke. As if he didn’t realize what he was doing, he smiled and replied back, claiming Rags’ authority in front of the other Goblins.</p>
<p>“It has been long. But I am here for war.”</p>
<p>At that the other Goblins standing next to the Chieftain stirred. Rags froze, and she put her hand on the crossbow which she always kept slung to her back. A second and she could have it out and firing. But the Chieftain sitting on his throne only laughed.</p>
<p>“War? Against us? If you wanted that, you would have brought three times the numbers with you, and no children and females.”</p>
<p>To Rags’ outrage the big Goblin pointed at <em>her </em>as she said that. She heard a murmur from the Goblins behind her, but dared not turn to see if it was in support or agreement with the Chieftain. Garen only smiled.</p>
<p>“I have brought many tribes. Strong ones. Smart ones. The one standing here is known as Rags. She is unique.”</p>
<p>He had named her, as if she was lesser! Rags nearly exploded, but the Chieftain laughed hugely. He peered at Rags, rising a bit from his bed of softness. She didn’t flinch as she met his eyes.</p>
<p>“Hah. Yes. She is small and young, a child still. Do you bed her, Garen Redfang? Or is it because she is your child that you give her power?”</p>
<p>That was it. Rags felt something snap. As she heard the Goblins standing around the Chieftain on the dais laughing, she raised her hand to her back.</p>
<p>The black crossbow was heavy, but Rags could lift it with one hand for a few moments. She pulled it out, cocked the crossbow with one pull that took all her strength, and had a heavy quarrel on the string before the laughter had stopped.</p>
<p>Rags swung the black crossbow up and pointed the bolt straight at the fat Goblin’s massive stomach. The entire room went still.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I am Chieftain here. Not Garen Redfang. I have come with my tribes here. I am Chieftain! Show respect!<br>
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She said it loudly, letting her voice ring out through the room. Rags stared up at the huge Goblin sitting on his throne fearlessly. The warriors around them had their hands on their weapons, but she only had eyes for him.</p>
<p>Two crimson eyes blazed in anger. Slowly, ignoring the crossbow trained on him, the Goblin Chieftain stood up. And when he did, Rags realized how huge he was. He was a giant, tall as a Minotaur and bigger still! His voice boomed as he pointed down at Rags, filled with anger.</p>
<p>“I am the Great Chieftain of the North, Tremborag! I met with the Goblin King ten years ago. When he came to Izril, he came to <em>my</em> tribe with his armies! I have seen his face. I know his name. Velan the Kind, last King of our people. You dare to come into my domain and challenge me? Know your place. <em>Kneel!</em>”</p>
<p>His last word thundered in the cavernous room, and the pressure that hit Rags and the other Goblins had to have been from a Skill. Garen gritted his teeth and grinned fiercely as Goblins around him dropped to one knee or cowered.</p>
<p>Rags felt her legs buckle, but she did not kneel. She looked around and saw most of the other Chieftains kneeling as well. Only three—a tall, female Hob and a normal-sized Goblin, both with the second most powerful tribes after Garen’s, refused to kneel. And, surprisingly, the Gold Rock Chieftain. He stood steadily on his feet, blinking and scratching at a layer of fat as he stared at Tremborag.</p>
<p>The crossbow was heavy in her hands. Rags lowered it, but kept the point trained on Tremborag’s feet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I am Chieftain too. You offer disrespect! Know <em>your</em> place.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Dead silence followed her words. Then Rags heard a voice. Garen, standing behind her, laughed. He laughed loudly, and then spoke to the Great Chieftain.</p>
<p>“See? She is fearless! And she is a Chieftain! My Chieftain.”</p>
<p><em>That</em> made all the Goblins standing with Tremborag go still with shock. Rags felt countless eyes on her, but stood proudly. She was Chieftain. That could not be taken away from her.</p>
<p>But Tremborag managed to do it with a dismissive glance. He looked at Garen.</p>
<p>“You? Gave way to her? Why?”</p>
<p>The Hob warrior grinned.</p>
<p>“She can lead armies. She is smart.”</p>
<p><em>As if she wasn’t here! </em>And he—Tremborag had the gall to suggest Garen had let Rags defeat him on purpose! The worst part was that he was right. Rags ground her teeth, but the conversation went on and she couldn’t break into it.</p>
<p>“A Chieftain to lead warriors while you fight in the front! I see! Clever! I would expect nothing less from Garen Redfang!”</p>
<p>Tremborag laughed hugely as he settled back down on his throne. Garen grinned too, but there was a spark in the air between the two Goblins. They were fighting for dominance, and everyone in the room felt it. The trouble was…well, that it wasn’t Rags doing the fighting. And she sensed like all the Goblins that both Garen and Tremborag were matched in their way.</p>
<p>“So. You have a leader and many tribes. Why have you come here, then, Garen Redfang? Did you not swear never to join the Goblin Lord? Did you not fight them, or were you too afraid and fled here?”</p>
<p>From behind Rags she heard Goblins shouting angrily at this—probably Garen’s warriors. But the Hob was calm, and replied coolly.</p>
<p>“We did fight. We fought an army. Goblin Lord’s army. Thousands strong. We slew them all. But it was warband.”</p>
<p>Silence. All Goblins could understand what this meant. Tremborag lost his grin and nodded. His face grew serious. He looked past Garen, and his voice deepened further, if that were possible.</p>
<p>“When the Goblin King lived, his raiding parties were tens of thousands strong. So I have heard. A Goblin Lord stands second-highest to a King. He is strong.”</p>
<p>“Strong. But he is no true Goblin.”</p>
<p>That came from Garen, and it was damning as it was shocking to hear, even though Rags knew his opinion. Tremborag gazed down at Garen silently, and nodded.</p>
<p>“He is not. But I ask again. Why do you come here, Garen Redfang?”</p>
<p>Everyone knew the answer, but Garen had to say it. He bared his teeth.</p>
<p>“To fight against the Goblin Lord. Together.”</p>
<p>Rags held her breath, forgetting for a moment that it was she who should have made the offer. Tremborag nodded closing his eyes briefly. But when he looked at Garen it was with another one of his smiles, as if he was playing some huge trick on the Hobgoblin.</p>
<p>“You say to ally. But here I sit in my kingdom in the mountain. My Goblins are strong. Why should I ally with you, you who has abandoned his home?”</p>
<p>Now Rags could answer. She opened her mouth, but to her outrage Garen stepped <em>past</em> her and spoke in her place. He gestured at her and the Goblins behind him. Rags had her hand on her sword, itching to stab him.</p>
<p>“I am strong. My tribe and other tribes—under Rags—is strong. And she is smart. She can lead armies to battle.”</p>
<p>At least he said that. Tremborag’s eyes focused on Rags briefly again, assessing, discarding.</p>
<p>“So? I have armies and strong and smart warriors of my own.”</p>
<p>Garen nodded. He touched something else, something hidden behind his armor. Rags stared at it, knowing what it had to be. A little key.</p>
<p>“I have something else. A prize. You know what it is.”</p>
<p>Tremborag stared at Garen’s hand. He nodded. Spoke quietly.</p>
<p>“Yes. I know what you have. And that false Goblin to the south shall not have it.”</p>
<p>The two stared at each other for a long minute. Then Tremborag nodded. He rose, and laughed. Then he spread his arms wide.</p>
<p>“So be it! Garen Redfang, we will fight together! This Goblin Lord will not rule us. And he will break his teeth upon this mountain if he should come for battle.”</p>
<p>A moment’s breath as Goblins understood this, and then thunder rang out as hundreds, thousands of voices shouted out. Rags realized the throne room, the banquet room, wasn’t just filled with warriors. Goblins, ones who were lesser warriors or not fighters at all, filled the upper balconies dug out of the rock or stood clustered around the entrance to the throne room.</p>
<p>Garen strode forwards, and he and Tremborag met. They didn’t hug or shake hands, but they stood together and so it was done. Rags knew it. And she also knew something else.</p>
<p>She’d lost her power here. Garen had taken it without a fight and without saying so, but he had taken it from her.</p>
<p>She just didn’t understand <em>how.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She confronted him as the banquet room was filling with thousands of Goblins. Tremborag was as good as his word, and he had declared a feast to celebrate. Huge baskets full of food, cooked meat and raw, and many other foods, vats of bubbling soup, were being taken out to feed the hungry mass of Goblins.</p>
<p>Rags wasn’t eating just yet. She stopped Garen as he finished peeing in a corner where other Goblins had done the same by the smell of it. He looked at her and grinned.</p>
<p>“Little Chieftain.”</p>
<p>That was it. Rags aimed a kick at the thing dangling between his legs. Garen frowned and blocked the blow.</p>
<p>“Painful. Don’t do that.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I am Chieftain!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She shouted it at him. Garen just pulled his pants up and shrugged. He looked at her as if he’d done very little wrong; an inconsequential thing she was getting worked up over.</p>
<p>“You are Chieftain. But I am Garen Redfang. And I am strong. So I am Chieftain too, in a way.”</p>
<p>“That is not…how…it works!”</p>
<p>Rags hissed at him, practically stumbling over the words. Garen just shook his head.</p>
<p>“You need me. I, Tremborag respects. Not you.”</p>
<p>It was true, but it didn’t stop Rags from trying to kick him in the same place. Garen just laughed and moved out of the way.</p>
<p>“It is time to eat. Eat, and then we shall talk, Chieftain.”</p>
<p>She watched him go, despairing inside. Well, Garen had said it. He wasn’t under her command. He just pretended to be because it was convenient. Now she knew. And she…</p>
<p>She had to do something about it. Instantly, Rags stopped thinking of the Redfang tribe as being hers. It was not. Her tribe was smaller now, and weaker. And it was in a place where one tribe reigned supreme.</p>
<p>But she was still Chieftain. Filled with that knowledge, Rags returned to the banquet room. Countless Goblins were tearing at food, eating in groups or alone – as alone as you could get in such a crowded room anyways – but the place of choice seemed to be reserved for the Goblins sitting at the massive table in front of the dais.</p>
<p>In truth, it didn’t make sense to Rags. Goblins didn’t use tables! Not unless they had a lot of food and the ground was really dirty, at any rate. And they didn’t do…formality. But these Goblins, Tremborag’s tribe, had clearly adopted the other species’ way of doing things.</p>
<p>It was just another thing that didn’t make sense to Rags, but food was food. She walked towards the table. The seats were almost exclusively filled by Hobs. Some elite Goblin warriors of regular size were there too, but it was clearly based on hierarchy. She saw her fellow Chieftains sitting at the table already, halfway up, and Garen at the far end.</p>
<p>But where did she sit? Rags saw a Goblin hurrying to intercept her. They had Goblins waiting on the table? True, Goblins always brought her food if she wanted it, but this—</p>
<p>Rags frowned as the meek Goblin pointed to a place on the table. Far <em>down</em> the table, near the end. It was where some of her warriors sat, including the Still Grass Chieftain. And it was not where she belonged.</p>
<p>Even if Garen and his tribe were not hers, Rags knew she belonged near the head of the table. She looked towards the throne and saw Tremborag, huge and inescapable, sitting there with Garen and a few of his warriors. The Great Chieftain was watching her. He was eating what looked like the entire bloody leg of a cow, and laughing at something Garen had said. But he was staring at her.</p>
<p>He’d put her here. Rags stared at the empty seat waiting for her. It was a deliberate insult, Rags knew. She stared up at the head of the table, where Garen sat next to Tremborag. Rags didn’t blush; she didn’t feel embarrassed in the slightest. No, the only thing in her heart was anger.</p>
<p>Rags didn’t take the seat. She turned from the meek Goblin and strode towards the head of the table, ignoring the looks she got from the other Goblins eating. They were watching her too. Of course they were. Probably most of the room was watching her, seeing what she did. That was Goblins for you. They watched everything. But Rags had never known a day where her actions mattered as much as now.</p>
<p>She stopped at the head of the table and looked around. Garen was sitting next to Tremborag, who was seated at the head of the wide table. And across from him…</p>
<p>“What is wrong, little Goblin? Are you lost? Your seat is over there!”</p>
<p>A Hob, battle-scarred and confident, sat in the chair across from Garen. He was holding some kind of crude mead in his hands—no doubt made in this very mountain—and laughing at her.</p>
<p>Rags just stared at him. She walked over and pointed to his seat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My seat. Move.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He blinked at her for a second, and then roared with mirth. The Goblins who’d heard Rags laughed as well, as did Tremborag. Garen was smiling and just watching Rags.</p>
<p>She calmly watched the Hob instead. He was laughing at her. So were the other Goblins, Hobs and normal ones alike. They didn’t respect her.</p>
<p>Was Rags angry? No. She’d gone far beyond that, into a realm where the words furious, incandescent, and wrathful were the soft option. The pure quill of rage was burning in Rags’ chest, which is why she did what she did next without thought for the consequences.</p>
<p>The Hob was still laughing as Rags looked at the table. It was rather high up, so she placed one hand on it. Then she swung herself upwards and stood on the table. Ignoring the dishes, Rags walked across the table, kicking plates out of the way and scattering mugs to the displeasure of their owners. The Hob sitting next to Tremborag blinked at her—</p>
<p>And she kicked him in the face.</p>
<p>It was a good kick. Solid. Rags put her entire body into it. It snapped the Hob’s head backwards, and he tipped backwards in his chair. It struck the ground with a thump, spilling him out of it.</p>
<p>And the noise—</p>
<p>Stopped.</p>
<p>Fighting wasn’t unusual at any mealtime. Any number of brawls or petty squabbles could break out and Goblins would ignore it or get clear or join in without raising an eyebrow. But this was different.</p>
<p>The entire hall went silent. The Hob surged to his feet, angry.</p>
<p>“You. Weak Goblin female! You challenge <em>me?</em>”</p>
<p>Did they all speak the common tongue? Rags stood with both feet planted, ignoring Tremborag’s grin and Garen’s eyes on her. She stared at the Hob and spoke loud enough for all to hear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I am Chieftain. This is my seat. Will you fight me?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Silence. The Hob stared at her incredulously. Then he snarled.</p>
<p>“I will beat you and take you for myself. You are weak!”</p>
<p>That was it. The hall, which had already been quiet, went still. He had challenged her, a Chieftain. Normally Tremborag would have stopped him, or supported the Hob, but he wasn’t about to do so, Rags knew.</p>
<p>And in that case, her tribe would defend Rags as their Chieftain. She waited. But heard only silence. Goblin culture demanded her Hobs and elite warriors would rise to her defense. But no one moved. Rags felt her heart freeze over. If they did not follow her—</p>
<p>A chair moved back. The Gold Stone Chieftain, sitting far down the table, stood up lazily, as if he was getting up to stretch his legs or pee. And as Goblins saw him stand, Rags saw the Still Grass Tribe’s Chieftain stand, full of nervous energy.</p>
<p>Three other Hobs stood as well, two females and a male. Three, out of the many she commanded. And the Fire Bite Chieftain remained sitting. But it was enough. Rags stared at the Hob, ready to fight. She would claim her authority right here and now, in blood and death if she had to.</p>
<p>The Hob snarled. He raised a fist and moved towards her. Rags called magic into her hand, ready to burn his face. She wouldn’t use her crossbow here; he was too close. Her sword. She had to prove—</p>
<p>“Rags is my Chieftain.”</p>
<p>Garen Redfang pushed back his chair suddenly. The Hob turned, suddenly wary. Garen smiled, his teeth glinting as he raised his voice.</p>
<p>“My Chieftain. You disrespect her.”</p>
<p>Rags stared with narrowed eyes at Garen. He’d stood up late. He wasn’t supporting her, not in the right way. But it was good for Garen. Now the Hob had to take him on; he couldn’t back down. The warrior hesitated, but then he came at Garen, fist swinging fast at the other Goblin’s head.</p>
<p>Too slow for Garen, though. The other Hob waited until the fist was close to his face before he lashed out. He leaned back and <em>kicked</em> the other Goblin in the chest.</p>
<p>Garen hit him so hard Rags could hear the Goblin warrior’s bones <em>crack</em>. The Hob stumbled back, sat down. Then he lay down and didn’t get back up.</p>
<p>“Here. Chieftain.”</p>
<p>Politely, Garen pulled back the chair. Rags stared at him in silence. Then, ignoring the fallen Hob who a few smaller Goblins ran over to drag away, she hopped off the table and took a seat.</p>
<p>“Well. You have claimed your seat, and your faithful warrior has protected you. Good!”</p>
<p>Tremborag said the words loudly, and noise resumed as if he had commanded it. He grinned down at Rags, and she saw how he could easily bite her head off with one chomp of his jaws. But she just stared up at him without flinching.</p>
<p>“She is brave. I told you she would not sit there.”</p>
<p>Garen sat back down, grinning as he tore into a bloody piece of meat. Tremborag laughed.</p>
<p>“Yes. You did. Well, we shall talk, little Rags and Garen Redfang. Talk, but only about small things. For now we eat!”</p>
<p>And as he spoke a plate was put in front of Rags. She stared down at it, askance; who used <em>plates? </em>The crude, clay plate sat in front of her, insultingly stupid. The table was fine—but she took it anyways. Rags grabbed as much food as she could reach, standing on the table much to Tremborag’s amusement.</p>
<p>And so Rags ate her fill, which was unusual for a Goblin. It usually meant everything was well, but as she found her tribe after the banquet and learned they had been assigned their own part of the stone city, and her Goblins had already been assigned tasks to fulfill, she knew all was not well.</p>
<p>Garen Redfang and Tremborag. Goblin legend, former Gold-rank adventurer and Chieftain. And a Chieftain who ruled over an actual palace, who claimed to be Great Chieftain among Goblins and spoke and acted like a Human.</p>
<p>Rags knew that she could not trust them.</p>
<p>Either of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was dark when Rags was finished familiarizing herself with the new role her tribe was filling in Tremborag’s domain. She didn’t like that her people were being split up, given new roles and places to sleep, as if they weren’t her tribe anymore. She didn’t like it, but she knew she couldn’t do anything about it right now.</p>
<p>She wanted to get out and explore this place, this massive city that spoke to her of past glories before the Goblins had claimed it. She wanted to learn more about Tremborag and join in on whatever he and Garen were planning. She wanted to think about her tribe and what she was losing or had already lost.</p>
<p>But two figures stopped her at the entrance to her quarters. Rags had her hand on her shortsword, but she stopped when she saw one of them.</p>
<p>The Gold Stone Chieftain stood lazily next to the door, chewing on something. A bone. He was munching it down, marrow and bone and all. Were his teeth made of iron?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chieftain.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He nodded to her. Rags nodded back, and stared at the other Goblin. He was a Hob, one of hers. Why was he here? Why was the Gold Stone Chieftain here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I am going.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She wanted to be alone. But the Gold Stone Chieftain just shook his head at her. He tapped his chest slowly, and spoke after a brief pause with a deep frown on his face.</p>
<p>“Should go with. Dangerous…alone.”</p>
<p>He had to use another language, because what he was saying was so foreign to Goblins. Rags couldn’t believe the implications. She might be attacked? Her? A Chieftain welcomed into another tribe’s hold?</p>
<p>She stared at the other Hob and then at the Gold Stone Chieftain. Two Hobs? She needed…?</p>
<p>Slowly, a dark feeling began to steal over Rags. She remembered the Hob’s comments, the one she’d kicked, and Tremborag’s. She wondered what the Gold Stone Chieftain had seen that made him come here. But she knew one thing.</p>
<p>He was loyal. Rags looked up at the Hob, who’d resumed crunching on his bone. She looked at him, and spoke the words that were in her heart.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>This place…is not Goblin. Not Goblin. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She felt it already. The other Hob stirred, but the Gold Stone Chieftain just nodded silently. Rags nodded as well.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>They are not Goblin. But I am. </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>It was a declaration that meant a thousand things, and it was one which meant war if anyone else were to hear. But they were alone. The Hob warrior looked nervous, but he stood with Rags. And the Gold Stone Chieftain just tossed the last bit of bone aside. He didn’t say much, but he knew exactly what to say.</p>
<p>“Yes, Chieftain.”</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When she woke up, it was like any ordinary day. But Mrsha knew it was special because she could smell the crepes.</p>
<p>She liked crepes. They were hot and chewy, and sometimes burned when Lyonette made them. Other times they were still runny, but they were always good because they came with honey.</p>
<p>The small Gnoll with white fur sat up in Lyonette’s empty bed, wriggling out of the covers she’d stolen again last night. Her short, bushy tail beat the ground hard, and in a few moments she raced downstairs.</p>
<p>Food! It wasn’t at all like the bloody meat she used to eat in her tribe’s camp, or the hot and filling stews. Those were spiced and tasted good, but they were made for everyone and sometimes there wasn’t enough. But here, in this inn that smelled of new wood and strange bug-men, Mrsha could always eat as much as she wanted.</p>
<p>And she could eat honey! The Gnoll drooled as she ran downstairs on all fours. She slipped near the bottom on one of the steps, though. Mrsha made a small sound of alarm, tried to catch her balance, failed, and tumbled down the stairs.</p>
<p>“Mrsha!”</p>
<p>It was the first word of the day, and it was hers. Mrsha uncurled from the protective ball she’d made and looked up. Hurrying across the big, empty room was a familiar face. The Human girl known as Lyonette rushed over to the Gnoll, already fretting out loud.</p>
<p>“Are you hurt? Are you okay? I <em>told</em> you not to run down the stairs! Oh, let me check—”</p>
<p>Mrsha turned her face up so Lyonette could see she was well. It was an odd thing the Human girl did, the Gnoll had found. She had to inspect Mrsha all over to see she was well. A Gnoll would have just sniffed to make sure there was no blood—Mrsha had fallen many times over the course of her young life and learned quickly not to cry over small things.</p>
<p>But Lyonette cared. She cared so much that it made Mrsha feel fuzzy inside sometimes. Already the Gnoll knew she’d get extra honey on her crepes—more than she usually got, which was already a lot. Because Lyon was a nice person. She took care of Mrsha. She took care of the inn while Ryoka and Erin were away.</p>
<p>That was what Mrsha understood. This was Ryoka’s home, and the home of the girl who made delicious things. Erin. But it was also Lyonette’s home, and she took care of it while they were gone.</p>
<p>It wasn’t Mrsha’s home. It wasn’t. But it was a good place, and it made Mrsha feel happy most of the time. And Lyonette always fed her here, although some of the things she made tasted bad.</p>
<p>She wasn’t a good cook. And she fussed about things like the cold and bugs and washing. And she couldn’t smell, at least, not like Mrsha could.</p>
<p>But she was kind. She fed Mrsha every day and she always asked Mrsha how she was feeling. She hugged Mrsha often and sometimes cried, but never when she knew Mrsha was around. She smelled of guilt and her hands had blisters from scrubbing and working now.</p>
<p>She was almost as good as a mother. But Mrsha’s mother was dead. And her father. And her tribe was dead too, every last one.</p>
<p>She was alone.</p>
<p>The black thoughts broke through Mrsha’s happiness suddenly. She sat at one of the tables as Lyonette fussed over her, suddenly filled with emptiness. She remembered.</p>
<p>Perhaps Lyonette noticed Mrsha’s suddenly drooping tail and ears, and the way she stared at her white fur. Maybe she didn’t. But in the next moment she had—</p>
<p>Crepes!</p>
<p>Mrsha forgot about what she’d been thinking on purpose. Her stomach rumbled and she wagged her tail and panted as the crepes came on a big plate next to a bowl filled with sweet honey. She reached for the first steaming one, but Lyonette grabbed her paw.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah! You know what to do first, Mrsha.”</p>
<p>The Gnoll child hesitated, and then saw another empty plate. She pulled it towards her, and Lyonette nodded encouragingly.</p>
<p>“And the silverware?”</p>
<p>Mrsha found a fork and knife as well. She put it next to her plate. Then she looked at Lyonette pleadingly. The girl smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>Instantly, the Gnoll grabbed a crepe off the plate. Ignoring the silverware and her own plate, she bit into it happily. Then she took the bowl of honey and poured some over her plate. She wiped some of the honey onto her crepe, took another bite. Sweetness and the electric rush of energy made her practically vibrate on her seat.</p>
<p>Sitting next to her, Lyonette laughed and tried to make Mrsha eat ‘civilized’, which was to say, slower, and with a knife and fork. But Mrsha was too hungry and why should she use a fork? Paws were faster.</p>
<p>That was breakfast, on a day like any other. But it was a good breakfast, and special because she wasn’t in the city. It had been nearly a week since Mrsha had left the Drake who made all the rules, Selys. She had come here, to a better place. She might have called it a home, but how could it be?</p>
<p>After she was done, Mrsha sat on her chair, snuffling at Lyonette’s plate, wondering if she had room to lick up crumbs or whether Lyonette would let her lick the plate clean. What would happen next?</p>
<p>It was a mystery. Some days Lyonette was busy and she’d go around cleaning up dust or cooking more food. But other days she’d play with Mrsha, or bathe her, or groom her hair. Mrsha had toys now. They were hers; the bossy Drake had given them to her. She wanted to play with the ball outside if Lyonette would throw it. Or maybe she could look at the wriggling thing? It was still sitting in the bowl; Mrsha could smell it. Maybe Lyonette wanted to play in the snow?</p>
<p>But then Mrsha smelled something different. Her head turned towards the stairs, and she went still in sudden fright.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a normal day after all. Because coming down the stairs, yawning, was a Drake. Not the bossy Drake, or the one who played chess.</p>
<p>Someone else.</p>
<p>Instantly, Mrsha was out of her chair and hiding behind Lyonette. But the girl only stroked her head and smiled at the strange Drake.</p>
<p>“Oh! Mister Shivertail. You’re up early.”</p>
<p>Shivertail? Mrsha’s ears perked up at the words. She looked at the Drake, and remembered that he was the one who’d come last night!</p>
<p>Zel? Mrsha remembered it because she’d never heard of anyone with a ‘z’ in their name before. Cautiously, she padded around the table and circled Zel Shivertail warily.</p>
<p>“Mrsha! Don’t be rude to a guest!”</p>
<p>Lyonette tried to chase Mrsha away, but she was slow. The Drake only laughed though, as he took a seat.</p>
<p>“I don’t mind, Mistress. Gnoll cubs are far easier to deal with than Drake hatchlings. Do I smell breakfast?”</p>
<p>“Oh! Let me get you a plate. I’ve made crepes—unless you’d like something else? I can do eggs and bacon…”</p>
<p>Mrsha perked up at the words, although she still felt full.</p>
<p>“Crepes will be fine.”</p>
<p>Lyonette hurried into the kitchen. When she came back with crepes and a glass she hovered around Zel while he ate, making contented sounds and Mrsha padded under the tables and chairs nearby, still watching the Drake and sniffing at him with keen interest.</p>
<p>She remembered something about him, didn’t she? He smelled like the sheets of the inn of course, and she could tell he’d travelled for a while because the odor of dried sweat emanated from his clothes. But there was something else, something familiar…</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, we don’t have anything to drink but milk and water. Um. Are Drake children really so hard to manage?”</p>
<p>“Water is fine—milk would be quite nice if you have it.”</p>
<p>Zel waited until Lyonette came back with a cooled pitcher of milk. Sneaking up on the Drake from behind, Mrsha listened to him talk to Lyonette with one ear as she kept sniffing.</p>
<p>“Children? They’re awful. I’ve never had any, but Drakes at a young age are temperamental and they <em>bite.</em> Of course, I hear Gnolls do too, but I’ve never had one of them bite my tail.”</p>
<p>Mrsha stared at Zel’s tail. It was curled around a chair leg. She wondered what it would taste like…</p>
<p>“Oh, well. I wouldn’t know. I’m new here. I mean…”</p>
<p>“It’s quite unusual to see any Humans here. I’m sorry, but I didn’t get the full story last night. You said this inn is run by a Human [Innkeeper] who settled here, didn’t you? But how did you come to be here? Did you move from one of the Human cities?”</p>
<p>Mrsha could hear Lyon hesitate as she crept closer one step at a time. Slowly, stealthily—like she was hunting butterflies. She crept along, towards the Drake’s back so he wouldn’t see her, still smelling something so familiar it hurt…</p>
<p>“It’s a long story.”</p>
<p>“If you have time, I’d like to hear it.”</p>
<p>“You’re not busy?”</p>
<p>“I don’t have anything I have to do right away. My…companion is probably still hungover from last night. I heard him say he’d be drinking the cold away and I’m not that keen on meeting him in any case. These crepes are quite good with this honey! Are there beehives around Liscor that have popped up in the last few years? I didn’t hear of that.”</p>
<p>“Oh, well, the bees are…um…it’s part of the long story, you see…”</p>
<p>Mrsha rolled her eyes silently; she didn’t want to hear a story she already knew! She wanted to hear Ryoka’s stories. But it meant both adults weren’t paying attention to her. Finally, Mrsha could crawl right behind the Drake’s chair.</p>
<p>There it was. The smell. She sniffed very quietly at the Drake’s claws. Something was lurking past the ordinary smells of unwashed scale, dirt, sweat, and so on.</p>
<p>Then she smelled the blood, faint and old on his claws and the deeper scents of oil and steel. And she remembered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>He runs out of the swirling snow, armor battered, unarmed. But he runs like a giant, and the Goblins attacking Ryoka and the Gnolls hesitate when they see him. And at his back, an army of Drakes appears as if by magic, howling and shouting with fury as they race towards the Goblins.</em></p>
<p><em>The Drake slashes out with his claws and tears through a Goblin wearing black armor as if the Goblin had worn nothing at all. He cuts down another Goblin—a Hob with a battleaxe—and charges onwards. At his side, a Drake with a sword that shines with magic cuts down two Goblins with one slash. </em></p>
<p><em>They run past Mrsha, and for a moment her heart leaps in her chest. But the Goblins are everywhere, and then a group of Hobs charges towards them. And she hides in the snow, cowering, wishing everything would go away. She is afraid, paralyzed by terror. Afraid, </em>afraid—</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>“Mrsha?”</p>
<p>She shook, and then realized Lyonette was staring down at her. For a second Mrsha was still afraid, but then she realized she was in the inn. She felt exhausted, and she stared up at Lyon as the girl looked anxiously at her.</p>
<p>“You were shaking. Are you alright? Why were you hiding underneath the table? You should sit with me.”</p>
<p>She reached for Mrsha, but the small Gnoll suddenly lashed out in anger. She nipped at Lyonette’s hand and the girl pulled back with a cry of pain.</p>
<p>“Ow! <em>Mrsha!</em>”</p>
<p>Filled with hot shame, Mrsha retreated back from the Human girl. She hid by another table. So tired. So afraid! She remembered, and looked past Lyonette to stare at the Drake who was eying her.</p>
<p>He was there. He had been there when she had lost her tribe. He—</p>
<p>He didn’t recognize her. At all. Why?</p>
<p>Because of her fur. Mrsha stared down at her white paws as Lyonette stepped back, looking hurt.</p>
<p>“Sorry about that. I guess Mrsha’s just a bit grumpy today.”</p>
<p>“So I see. I might have upset her—Gnolls can be very territorial. It’s strange though. I’ve never seen a Gnoll with white fur before.”</p>
<p>“Oh? But you’ve heard of Gnolls with white fur? I thought Mrsha was unique.”</p>
<p>The Gnoll backed slowly away from the two as Lyonette turned to Zel eagerly. Her heart was beating too fast and she still felt—he had been there. And because he had been there, Mrsha felt like she was back there, too.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of it. It’s more of a rumor than anything else, but the Gnolls believe certain colors have meaning. White, for instance, is not a natural color for Gnolls of any tribe.”</p>
<p>“But it means something? Ryoka was saying that she thought it had a meaning, but none of the Gnolls would tell her what it meant.”</p>
<p>“I can tell you what I know, but it’s just rumors…”</p>
<p>Mrsha turned away. She covered her floppy ears with her paws. She did not want to hear. She knew what her fur meant.</p>
<p>It meant her tribe was gone. And it meant it was her fault. Mrsha knew that. She couldn’t deny it, no matter how much she wanted to.</p>
<p>[Last Survivor]. Level 8. That was what the voice had told her. It had told her she was the last.</p>
<p>There was no one left.</p>
<p>The knowledge crushed Mrsha, pressed down on her heart until it seemed like there was no air to breathe, no place to exist. They were dead. Her tribe—the Stone Spears—</p>
<p>Were dead.</p>
<p>Because of her.</p>
<p>It felt like suddenly the world was darker, the ceiling lower. And Mrsha was smaller, and it was hard to breathe. She gasped and trembled underneath her table as voices echoed overhead, weirdly distant.</p>
<p>She had to leave. She had to get out. Mrsha stared towards the door, and then ran for it.</p>
<p>“Mrsha! Where are you going?”</p>
<p>Lyonette turned to the Gnoll as she reached up for the handle. Mrsha froze guiltily, but the girl went on.</p>
<p>“Going to the outhouse? Alright, but come back quickly! And don’t try to crawl down there! Remember last time?”</p>
<p>Mrsha didn’t turn. She just opened the door and escaped into the powdery snow. Immediately the world turned bright and white, and cold. Mrsha with all her fur felt cold, but she didn’t care. At this moment she couldn’t bear to be in the inn, not near the Drake who smelled of death and reminded her of what she’d lost. Mrsha looked around the snowy landscape.</p>
<p>There was only one place to go, really. The city. As young as she was, Mrsha still knew the dangers of being alone in the wilderness. So she began to run through the snow, barely visible in the morning light. She was a white patch of color amid a scene dedicated to the very same color.</p>
<p>So perhaps it was no wonder the Drake on guard on the southern gate didn’t notice her. He was standing at attention, but idly. And he didn’t have the nose of a Gnoll, so Mrsha slipped past him with no effort.</p>
<p>And then she was in the streets, staring around at the building curiously, and at the many Drakes and Gnolls—and the few Humans—walking down the streets. A thousand scents assaulted Mrsha’s nose at once, and she breathed out slowly.</p>
<p>Better. She could forget. Only—after a few seconds, Mrsha realized she couldn’t forget. Here too was a bad place that drove her backwards in time. Because of the staring.</p>
<p>They stared at her. Drakes and Gnolls. But while the Drakes did it idly, wondering perhaps whose child Mrsha was, or at her odd fur coloring, the Gnolls were different. They stared and they <em>knew.</em></p>
<p>It was too much to bear, so Mrsha ran again. She ran through the sea of legs, turned down the first alley she came to.</p>
<p>Quiet. Alone. That was what she wanted. She didn’t want—</p>
<p>Mrsha’s claws pulled at her fur. She pulled at it, as if she could get rid of it. Some hairs came out, and she felt pain, but she pulled more out, biting at her fur, savage, angry.</p>
<p>It wasn’t fair! It wasn’t her fault!</p>
<p>But it was. And as the despair flooded over Mrsha again, she thought of home. But home was gone. And the inn wasn’t her home. Ryoka wasn’t there, and she—</p>
<p>She wanted to go back.</p>
<p>Again and again. It felt like Mrsha was turning in circles, and she chased her tail in the wet alleyway, turning about until she was dizzy and wanted to throw up. But it was better than remembering. Anything was.</p>
<p>What now? She couldn’t stay here. Last time she’d run away from Selys, the Watch had found her because she’d tried to hide in alleyways. Mrsha had to go somewhere.</p>
<p>But where? Inn? No. So…</p>
<p>Something swirled on the breeze and Mrsha’s nose <em>twitched</em> as she caught a scent. Gnolls had powerful noses, but their children had far stronger tracking abilities. And so what Mrsha smelled was faint, mixed with a thousand scents, but she still caught it.</p>
<p>A familiar smell. Someone she knew. Instantly, Mrsha padded out of the alleyway and onto the streets. But she paused then, realizing one thing was giving her away.</p>
<p>She was on all fours. It was faster, but in her tribe Urksh had been teaching her to walk on two legs. Mrsha did this now. It was hard—and slower! But she had to blend in, at least a bit. A Drake [Guardsman] would stop a Gnoll child who was alone and on all fours, but if she walked like this, they would think she was older.</p>
<p>No one stopped Mrsha as she walked hesitantly down the street, pausing to sniff or steady herself against a wall or passing object. Perhaps the patrolling Watch members she saw would have paid attention to her, but they were too busy eying the Humans.</p>
<p>There were a lot of them in Liscor, or rather, Mrsha saw at least one Human down every street she walked. But that was many for the citizens of Liscor, and Mrsha saw how the pedestrians avoided walking near the Humans, especially the adventurers who walked in groups of their own.</p>
<p>Down the street. And then left—sticking close to a wall to avoid the rumbling wagons that went down the middle. The smell grew stronger the more Mrsha followed it, and soon she was able to identify what it was.</p>
<p>In Mrsha’s mind an image of a taciturn Human, sitting in a corner of the inn while Erin chatted to him, surfaced. She blinked in surprise and nearly fell forwards.</p>
<p>She knew him! He was the grumpy Human, the one who smelled like leather and alcohol and arrow glue! Mrsha knew what that smelled like. She’d always hung around [Fletchers] as they made arrows—until they chased her away, that was. But this man was different than the [Hunters] of her tribe. He didn’t smell like dead animals, but other things. He killed strange creatures Mrsha could not dream of.</p>
<p>The smell was coming from a big building in front of her. Mrsha blinked up at it. It was an inn, like Erin’s but very full of people—all of them seemingly Drakes. But Halrac’s scent was coming from within, along with the smells of alcohol and food. Mrsha hesitated. Should she go elsewhere?</p>
<p>But she had nowhere else to go. And she liked the grumpy Human. So Mrsha fearlessly entered the inn full of Drakes. She looked around and immediately found the Humans because they were sitting in a corner of the room, and most of the Drakes had their backs to them.</p>
<p>Mrsha glanced around, but none of the Drakes were looking at her. It was because she had a Skill. [Natural Concealment]. Carefully, she crept over to the table where he sat, arguing with three other Humans.</p>
<p>“—I’m telling you, we shouldn’t stand for it!”</p>
<p>He sounded angry. Halrac’s voice rasped as he argued with a big man in armor—Mrsha stared his bulging arms—and a young woman who smelled like cotton and cloth and an old man with a staff who smelled of magic. Magic to Mrsha was the smell of burned ozone, the sharp tang of electricity, and a whiff of something else that defied explanation.</p>
<p>“We paid good coin for those rooms. I don’t care if that damned [Innkeeper] is offering us another set of rooms. How do we know he won’t kick us out of those as well?”</p>
<p>“Because, Halrac, we pay more than any of his other customers.”</p>
<p>That came from the girl with stitches around her wrists. She smelled of magic too, but it was the cloth scent that came strongly from her that intrigued Mrsha. The Gnoll stared at her as she edged closer to the table, sniffing to see if there were any scraps. Was her entire body made of cotton? That couldn’t be right, but that’s what it smelled like.</p>
<p>A man with a big, gray beard leaned across the table to pull a plate of the spicy flat cakes the Drakes loved to eat towards him. He took one and ate it as he spoke, sounding wise and calm, or like how Mrsha imagined wise and calm people spoke.</p>
<p>“It cannot be helped. The Drake who came by is a Lord of the Wall. To Drakes, that would be the equivalent of a major [Lord] or one of the Five Families turning up. We should count ourselves fortunate that he didn’t reserve the entire inn.”</p>
<p>“Arrogant bastard. I recognize him—he’s a commander as well. Did you see his arms and weapons? We don’t have enchantments of that quality. If it came to a fight, though—”</p>
<p>“We’re not at war, Halrac.”</p>
<p>That was all the big man said. Mrsha saw the [Scout] slowly nod, although he still looked angry.</p>
<p>“I say we should leave. It’s not worth the coin we’re paying to stay here.”</p>
<p>The girl with stitches and dark skin drawled as she sat back in her chair.</p>
<p>“Say I agree with you. I’m getting tired of being sneered at behind my back too, but where would we go? There aren’t any inns not full to bursting in this city and <em>we</em> can’t kick anyone out, unless we’re willing to pay more than we are now.”</p>
<p>Was she a [Mage]? Mrsha crept a bit further under the table, hiding under Halrac’s chair. She wondered if any of the adventurers would drop some food by accident, or if she could steal a snack. Probably not.</p>
<p>“There’s one inn that’s empty. I told you about it before.”</p>
<p>“Your little watering hole. Right. Well, it can’t be worse than waiting thirty minutes for food to arrive.”</p>
<p>The Stitch-girl made a face. The big man exchanged glances with the man with the beard, and then leaned forwards.</p>
<p>“You told us the [Innkeeper] vanished a while back. Has she returned?”</p>
<p>Halrac shrugged.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. But there’s still a girl in the inn. A [Barmaid].”</p>
<p>The man with the beard looked amused. Mrsha wondered if it got in his way. Gnolls had fur, but not beards. Wouldn’t it get messy when he drank soup or ate food?</p>
<p>“An inn without an [Innkeeper]. Still fancy moving, Revi?”</p>
<p>Revi, the girl, frowned.</p>
<p>“Maybe. It’s empty, you said?”</p>
<p>Halrac nodded. The big man looked unconvinced.</p>
<p>“If the beds are empty, it’s probably for a good reason.”</p>
<p>The [Scout] rolled his eyes expressively. He jerked a thumb at a passing [Barmaid]—who glared at him behind his back.</p>
<p>“A place to sleep—even if it does mean we don’t get waited on hand and foot—is still better than paying ten times as much to be stared at like we’re pariahs.”</p>
<p>“Fine.”</p>
<p>Revi sighed. She looked at the man with the beard.</p>
<p>“Typhenous?”</p>
<p>Beard man paused and stroked said beard.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t mind a bit more inconvenience if it means cheaper rates. If we’re planning to stay for as long as I fear we are, we should attempt to conserve our coin.”</p>
<p>Revi and Halrac nodded; all eyes turned towards the big man.</p>
<p>“Ulrien?”</p>
<p>“I don’t really care.”</p>
<p>His voice was deep. Mrsha could smell blood on him—not a fresh wound, but the traces of it. She knew this because she was staring right at one amazingly muscled calf. She longed to poke it, but she knew she had to be quiet.</p>
<p>And then—noise! Footsteps approaching. And silence—an audible drop in the background babble of the inn. Mrsha peeked out from her table and immediately hid when she saw the other three beings approaching. She didn’t think they were Human.</p>
<p>“Jelaqua.”</p>
<p>“Ulrien. Is there room at your table for us to sit?”</p>
<p>Mrsha, curled tightly around the center of the table, heard Ulrien reply after a moment of hesitation.</p>
<p>“I don’t see why not. We’ll have to grab chairs and move—”</p>
<p><strong>“Watch the Gnoll cub or you’ll squish her.”</strong></p>
<p>Mrsha froze in surprise. She heard a rustle, and then Halrac’s glaring face peeked below the edge of the table with the other three adventurers. They all looked surprised, and the…woman…named Ivirith laughed.</p>
<p>“You didn’t notice the Gnoll child? You’re losing your touch, Halrac.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think we’d be spied upon. You there…Gnoll! Come on out!”</p>
<p>Cautiously, Mrsha did just that. She stared up and immediately shrank back when she saw the newcomers. But they didn’t look <em>angry…</em></p>
<p>“Halrac, you know this Gnoll?”</p>
<p>“She’s from the inn. I don’t know why she’s here.”</p>
<p><strong>“Perhaps she’s grown attached to you. I have heard of stranger things.”</strong></p>
<p>The weird-echoing voice came from one of the new adventurers. He looked like he was part crab or part…Mrsha had never seen anything like him before. She stared wide-eyed at the man, before looking <em>up</em> at the giant whose head was nearly touching the rafters.</p>
<p>“What do we do with her? I don’t suppose the [Innkeeper] would summon the Watch to bring her home.”</p>
<p>Revi frowned at Mrsha, and then smiled. Mrsha glared at her; she could tell when adults were pretending to be nice!</p>
<p>“Where are you from, little one? Shouldn’t you be going home?”</p>
<p>“She’s mute, Revi.”</p>
<p>The Stitch-Girl drew back and sighed.</p>
<p>“Pity.”</p>
<p>“Oh, let her sit here. Where are those chairs? Oh, thank you, Moore.”</p>
<p>The half-Giant casually lifted the chairs over. Mrsha blinked at her seat, but then sat in it. Her head barely peeked over the table. She stared, wide-eyed at the one who had spoken.</p>
<p>A woman with dead-white skin stared back at her, lips turned upwards in a smile. But Mrsha didn’t smile back.</p>
<p>The woman was<em> dead</em>. Mrsha could smell it on her. She was dead, but <em>something</em> lived inside her. It was frightening, and Mrsha edged away from the dead woman as she reached out to pet Mrsha on the head.</p>
<p>“Keep away from her, Jelaqua. You’ll scare her.”</p>
<p>Halrac said this irritably, catching Jelaqua’s hand. She glanced at him in annoyance, then looked at Mrsha’s wide eyes.</p>
<p>Jelaqua stopped, sighed, and withdrew her hand. She smelled like death, but she still moved as if she were alive. Mrsha’s fur stood up on end as she scooted her chair away towards Halrac’s seat.</p>
<p>“Aw, don’t be like that little Gnoll. You’re the only one of your kind who hasn’t walked twenty paces wide of me since I’ve been here.”</p>
<p>The woman pulled the plate of snacks across the table and pushed it gently towards Mrsha. The Gnoll hesitated, and then grabbed one greedily. Breakfast seemed an age ago.</p>
<p>“Here. Have one of these. And—[Barmaid]! Drinks for the table, if you would! Ale!”</p>
<p>The pale woman turned and called out to a passing Drake, who nodded, eyes wide as she stared at the woman. Unperturbed, Jelaqua turned back and nodded to Ulrien.</p>
<p>“We’ll pay for what we order, don’t worry.”</p>
<p>Ulrien waved a big hand.</p>
<p>“Forget it. Coin for food and drink is hardly something Gold-rank adventurers need to worry about.”</p>
<p>Jelaqua paused, and then nodded her head to him with a wry smile.</p>
<p>“We’re used to arguments over it. And with how much Moore can drink, well, it’s good to get that out of the way, especially when we’re trying to negotiate.”</p>
<p>“Negotiate? About what?”</p>
<p>Halrac stared suspiciously at the three adventurers. Typhenous rolled his eyes and stroked his beard with one hand.</p>
<p>“There can be only one thing. The dungeon.”</p>
<p>Jelaqua nodded.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“If you think we’ll give up our claim—”</p>
<p>“Halrac.”</p>
<p>Ulrien’s word silenced the [Scout]. Jelaqua shook her head.</p>
<p>“We’re not here for that. Rather, we’d like to team up.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>The adventurers on Halrac’s side seemed surprised, although Mrsha didn’t understand what was actually happening.</p>
<p>“It’s only practical. It’s too dangerous by ourselves.”</p>
<p>That came from the huge giant, Moore. He had a surprisingly soft voice and he nibbled at one of the doughy discs very carefully.</p>
<p><strong>“We’ve gotten scratched up twice going in there. Both times we didn’t have the numbers for a clean fight. And I’ve heard every other team that’s gone in has run into all sorts of hellish traps, same as us. Those that make it out, that is. If we want to make real progress, we need to work together.”</strong></p>
<p>“Seborn is right.”</p>
<p>Jelaqua took a mug from the tray the Drake [Barmaid] was carrying, ignoring the way the Drake flinched as she stared at the Selphid. Jelaqua took a drink, grimaced.</p>
<p>“Dead gods. This isn’t good stuff. How much do you pay to stay at this inn? Anyways, the last time we went into the dungeon we ran into a pit trap the length of the entire corridor and fifty feet down. If Moore hadn’t cast a spell we’d be dead. But after we landed—guess what was at the bottom of the pit? A colony of Metalbite Slimes.”</p>
<p>Halrac and the other adventurers made noises of dismay. Ulrien shook his head.</p>
<p>“That’s…bad.”</p>
<p>Jelaqua drained the rest of her mug, grimacing. She did not call for a refill.</p>
<p>“Right? But I’ll bet you ran into just as bad a trap. Did you see what chased the last group of adventurers out? The Children. There are entire colonies of monsters in that dungeon, branching pathways that seem to change each time we go in, and traps both magical and mundane—we can’t handle it alone. The Halfseekers are already understrength, but we thought if we combined forces we might stand a chance of getting somewhere in this dungeon. What do you think?”</p>
<p>The team of Griffin Hunt turned and conferred silently. After a moment, Ulrien nodded.</p>
<p>“We could use the extra help.”</p>
<p>Typhenous and Revi both nodded. All eyes turned to Halrac, including Mrsha’s. Revi frowned at him; the [Scout] did not look happy as he shifted his attention between the three half-Humans.</p>
<p>“Halrac?”</p>
<p>He grimaced.</p>
<p>“I have no reason to object. My [Dangersense] is screaming at me every step I take inside that place. Someone else to check for traps would help.”</p>
<p>All the adventurers relaxed. Jelaqua smiled, and Seborn nodded at Halrac soberly.</p>
<p><strong>“Even together, I fear that we will not progress quickly. But it will be reassuring to work with another expert.”</strong></p>
<p>“A team, then. We can haggle over distribution of spoils later—”</p>
<p>“No need. We’ll split it evenly.”</p>
<p>Jelaqua’s brows rose in surprise, but then she was smiling as she clasped hands with Ulrien over the table. She looked around the inn and sighed.</p>
<p>“I’m relieved. If I’d known you would be so open to the idea I would have come earlier. A team. It’s been a long time since our group joined forces with any other party. On that note—do you know if this inn has any openings? We just got kicked out of ours.”</p>
<p>“Really? Why?”</p>
<p>“You have to ask?”</p>
<p>All three Halfseekers smiled crookedly. Mrsha wriggled in her seat. She was getting bored! She watched Jelaqua’s pale lips moving, wondering why she didn’t rot when she was dead.</p>
<p>“Selphids aren’t popular on Izril—less so than Baleros, incredibly. All the rumors about my kind lead to suspicion and paranoia. As for Moore…someone with a quarter of a Giant’s blood in him is hard to feed, let alone find a bed for. Oh, and apparently Seborn smells like fish.”</p>
<p>“<strong>Untrue. But arguing doesn’t help matters.</strong>”</p>
<p>Mrsha’s stomach rumbled. She probably shouldn’t have eaten so much. But it was so tasty! She looked around as the adventurers spoke about boring things.</p>
<p>“We just got kicked out of the best rooms in this inn too. No help here, I’m afraid. But Halrac’s been telling us to visit another inn—you know, the one outside the city where we had that—”</p>
<p>“Really? Do you think it’s still empty? I was wary of being outside, especially since it seemed like there was some drama to do with the Gnolls. And that skeleton! But if we’ve no other choice—it would be good to work under the same roof…”</p>
<p>Mrsha was powerfully curious about the Halfseekers, it was true. She’d love nothing more than to sniff at Seborn and Moore, but she knew it wouldn’t be polite. She could sit here and eat more food maybe, but—she didn’t want to sit here! Now that she’d been caught, the fun was over. Mrsha wriggled in her seat, and looked towards the open doors. Time to go. She grabbed another spicy, doughy treat and slipped off her chair.</p>
<p>“Hey now. Where are you going young Miss?”</p>
<p>The big half-Giant, Moore, turned to Mrsha and she froze. But he looked concerned rather than angry. Mrsha edged away from him, ready to bolt, but Halrac stopped Moore as the half-Giant moved to rise.</p>
<p>“Leave her. The last thing we need to be accused of is harassing a child. The inn’s not far from here and the streets are safe.”</p>
<p>“But is the inn safe? I would hate for a child to be put in danger. The monsters around the city can be dangerous, especially if some escape from the dungeon. It is waking up.”</p>
<p>“The Watch patrols, and they’re as good as—better than teams of Silver-rank adventurers. I saw one of them—a Drake. He knows how to fight!”</p>
<p>Seborn frowned at Jelaqua, although only the fleshy half of his face moved.</p>
<p><strong>“They patrol within the city. But if you’re really suggesting we sleep outside of it—are there any guards in this inn, any enchantments? Or will we be sleeping with one ear to the ground?”</strong></p>
<p>Mrsha scampered out of the inn as the adventurers continued to argue. She didn’t know what they were talking about. Mrsha seldom did. But they were busy and Halrac seemed sad. He always seemed sad, which is why Mrsha felt a bit drawn to him.</p>
<p>Maybe he knew what being alone was like.</p>
<p>Disappointed and lonely, Mrsha wandered back onto the street. There she remembered why she’d gone inside. The Gnolls stared at her. A passing trio of Drakes—a child and mother and father slowed as they saw Mrsha. The child pointed to her.</p>
<p>“Why is her fur white?”</p>
<p><em>Because she was the last.</em> Mrsha turned and ran down the street. Where now? Back?</p>
<p>No—there was someone else. The bossy Drake. She would be nice to Mrsha. The Gnoll raised her nose to the air and sniffed.</p>
<p>There? No—there? It was hard to pick out her smell on the streets. Mrsha would have to search to find her.</p>
<p>But something else smelled familiar to her. Mrsha looked up and saw a familiar person.</p>
<p>Pawn! The Antinium was walking down the street. Mrsha immediately ran after him, but he had a lead on her and it was hard for her to follow through the crowds of people. When she did catch up with him, she found herself on an abandoned street—</p>
<p>And staring down into a hole in the ground. That was what it looked like. Suddenly, an entire street just…vanished. The cobblestones ended, and a sloping path of dirt led down into darkness. Mrsha halted on the edge of it, uncertain. Strange smells were coming from below—the same smells as that of the huge Soldiers who’d come from the inn.</p>
<p>But Pawn had gone down there, she knew. And the Soldiers were nice! So, bold and unafraid, Mrsha ran down the dirt tunnel, into the darkness.</p>
<p>It wasn’t fully dark. Glowing patches of moss lit up the tunnel immediately, but it was still far too dark for a Human to see. Mrsha could see just fine though. She ran forwards eagerly, but froze when she realized she was surrounded.</p>
<p>Standing in the walls, huge, silent, were Soldiers. They stepped out as one, clenching their fists in a clear sign of aggression. Mrsha backed up as she saw more Soldiers appearing <em>behind</em> her! It was a trap!</p>
<p>The Soldiers were ready to kill, but not ready for the sight of a small Gnoll. They stared at her. But then they started forwards again, hostile, and so Mrsha ran.</p>
<p>She ran. The wrong way, as it turned out. In order to get away from the looming Soldiers Mrsha had to race into the dark tunnels. They chased after her, but while they could have blocked a Human, Drake, or any other species quite easily, Mrsha was too small and slipped between their legs. She dashed forwards—</p>
<p>And found herself in a huge network of tunnels, filled with shadows in the dim illumination. Crisscrossing openings, paths leading up and down—</p>
<p>And Antinium. Hundreds of them, all marching in an unending current. Mrsha froze as they all turned and stared at her. A group of Soldiers turned towards her, and she heard the ones behind her running. Mrsha dashed forwards, unthinking, and hurtled down a tunnel, past Workers who stood aside from her.</p>
<p>Where was she going? Away! Mrsha had no idea where she was, she just ran from all the Antinium she could see, especially the soldiers.</p>
<p>Left, left, right! A dark shadow came out of a side passage—Mrsha turned the other way.</p>
<p>She ran downwards, then right, took another right, and another—but she wasn’t where she’d started when she turned right again. Instead, she found a opening at the end of the passageway. Mrsha ran through it, too frightened to stop—</p>
<p>And found herself in a gargantuan room, staring up at the Queen of the Free Antinium under Liscor. The massive Antinium—more insectile than humanoid—paused as she lifted a morsel of what might have been food to her mouth with feelers.</p>
<p>“What is this?”</p>
<p>Soldiers. They appeared next to Mrsha. They’d been guarding the doorway! She turned to run, but they were blocking the entrance, boxing her in! Their hands were raised to bludgeon her to death, but a deep feminine voice rumbled.</p>
<p>“Hold.”</p>
<p>The Soldiers froze instantly. Mrsha raised her head cautiously; she’d been cowering on the ground. She turned to the Queen, and heard a rumble like a sigh.</p>
<p>“Child of Gnolls. You should not be here.”</p>
<p>Carefully, Mrsha padded forwards. The Queen’s full body was obscured in the partial darkness. Mrsha only had the impression of a bulbous, huge abdomen and…body parts that were feelers and antennae rather than arms and legs.</p>
<p>“So now the people living here are fearless enough to let their young intrude into the Hive? I should feel glad—but I do not. Only death awaits trespassers here. You should know that child, or your parents should.”</p>
<p>Mrsha could only hold still as the massive presence regarded her.</p>
<p>“White fur? How intriguing.”</p>
<p>She knew. Mrsha bowed her head. In this place, she couldn’t run. Her ears perked up as she heard hammering footsteps, and then another Antinium ran into the room. He had to pause—the Soldiers barred his way, but after the Queen gestured, they moved aside smoothly. She recognized Klbkch on sight.</p>
<p>“My Queen! I arrived as soon as I heard of the intrusion. Where is—”</p>
<p>He stopped when he saw Mrsha.</p>
<p>“You?”</p>
<p>“You know this Gnoll, Klbkch?”</p>
<p>“She belongs at the inn, my Queen.”</p>
<p>“The one with the girl Erin Solstice.”</p>
<p>Another sigh echoed throughout the room. Mrsha saw Klbkch staring at her. He slowly walked in front of Mrsha as if shielding her.</p>
<p>“It seems this innkeeper causes trouble even when she is not here.”</p>
<p>“This child does not know the rules of Liscor, my Queen. I am sure her trespass was accidental.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps. But the rules must be kept. Make sure other visitors to the city are aware of this. And this Gnoll…”</p>
<p>Again, Mrsha felt the Queen staring at her, and this time it was with more than a hint of malice. She trembled, hiding behind Klbkch, feeling the need to pee.</p>
<p>“I am sure the citizens of Liscor would be greatly disturbed if she were to be harmed.”</p>
<p>“I am not a fool, Klbkchhezeim. Very well, take the Gnoll cub away. But while you are here—tell me, what do the others do?”</p>
<p>Klbkch relaxed slightly. He bowed his head towards the Queen.</p>
<p>“Nothing, as of yet. They are resting. It has been a long journey; some marched for over a week with little rest.”</p>
<p>“Hm. You are attending to their needs?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“…Xrn is here.”</p>
<p>The name meant nothing to Mrsha, but she saw how Klbkch’s posture changed when he heard it. He nodded.</p>
<p>“Her presence is extraordinary. But perhaps it is a sign that the Grand Queen is open to your ideas at last?”</p>
<p>“Or perhaps she has directed her attention here for another reason. Perhaps she seeks you, Klbkchhezeim.”</p>
<p>Silence from the Antinium in front of Mrsha. She saw the Antinium Queen shift posture, heard her voice deepen ominously.</p>
<p>“She cannot have you. The Grand Queen will not take you from me, Klbkch. My Slayer.”</p>
<p>“I am loyal.”</p>
<p>That was all Klbkch said, but it was not enough. Mrsha felt so. The Queen’s voice was almost hesitant as she addressed the Revalantor of her hive.</p>
<p>“Ah, Klbkch. You say that, but…do you regret it? Do you regret that we fled while the others stayed and fought? Do you think we wasted the lives of your brothers and sisters, that we have failed in the long years since arriving here?”</p>
<p>For a long while he was silent. Klbkch looked down at his feet, and then up at his Queen. When he replied, it was softly.</p>
<p>“You have done well, my Queen. You and the others. You rebuilt with what you had; I cannot begrudge that. I only regret that I was too weak to finish the battle on Rhir. It is myself I blame.”</p>
<p>Then he turned, and walked out of the vast room. Mrsha turned to look back just once; she saw the Queen had her head bowed. Then she walked faster to catch up with Klbkch. Mrsha had a bad feeling in her stomach. She wondered exactly how much trouble she was in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“She was lucky she was not killed.”</p>
<p>Klbkch said that to Krshia as the Gnoll [Shopkeeper] glared at Mrsha. The Gnoll cub had tears in her eyes; a spanking did that to her, and Gnolls didn’t believe in light punishments. Now Krshia was letting Mrsha lie on her front while she and Klbkch sat around her table on two couches.</p>
<p>“I am grateful, yes, that you were here, Klbkch. I shudder to think what would have happened otherwise.”</p>
<p>The Gnoll bowed her head deeply and poked Mrsha <em>hard</em>. Mrsha sat up and bowed her head too, rubbing at her stinging bottom.</p>
<p>“I have brought her to you so that you may impress upon her that venturing into the Hive is dangerous. I do not know if she fully understands me.”</p>
<p>“She understands. And if she does not understand fully how foolish she was, she will remember the spanking, yes?”</p>
<p>Krshia glared at Mrsha and the Gnoll immediately nodded her head. Klbkch stared at her, and then looked at Krshia.</p>
<p>“I have noticed her unique coloration. I have also noticed how other Gnolls react to her fur. What does it mean?”</p>
<p>Antinium did not do small talk. Nor did they care about feelings. Or rather, they found them hard to understand sometimes. Mrsha froze, but it was Krshia who put a gentle hand on Mrsha’s head. She stroked Mrsha gently, and the Gnoll relaxed, feeling a familiar presence of a Gnoll adult reassuring her. But it still hurt because it was not the same.</p>
<p>“You ask about things which are not easy to discuss, Klbkch.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Hr. Well then. The white fur is a mark of fate, dire fate, to Gnolls. Some claim it is a curse. Others—a sign of disaster. Those who look so bring misfortune to their tribes and all they encounter, or so it is said, yes?”</p>
<p>“I see. And is it true?”</p>
<p>Krshia shrugged. Mrsha stirred, looking at her face, but the Gnoll’s expression was calm, if slightly troubled.</p>
<p>“How can we know? Some, a few, are born with the fur, and others…others lose their color after terrible things occur. Like Mrsha. Did they cause it or not? I do not know, but my people fear such individuals regardless.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Klbkch ate a cube of raw meat and said little else. Krshia eyed him, and then muttered.</p>
<p>“Myself, I think it is just superstition. The Stone Spears tribe were doomed the instant a Goblin Lord led his army upon them, regardless of fate. Young Mrsha should know this as well, but other, more foolish Gnolls will say differently.”</p>
<p>“It is well that she stays outside the city then. Can you ensure no one tries to attack Mrsha, or is this a matter for the Watch?”</p>
<p>“I will ensure it. No Gnoll will slay another Gnoll while I live.”</p>
<p>Krshia growled the words and Mrsha felt better. Klbkch nodded, and they fell silent again. She sensed that the two of them weren’t losing track of the conversation as much as understanding things silently.</p>
<p>“How is business?”</p>
<p>“I rebuild. Slowly.”</p>
<p>“But I gather from your words that your authority among the Gnolls within Liscor is lessened due to recent events. Is this so?”</p>
<p>“I wait for Ryoka Griffin to return. She has something promised to me, and until it arrives I remain…antsy. As do the Gnolls who listen to me. But I have my paws full in the meantime. I must run a shop regardless if it is smaller, and I have a worthless nephew to take care of.”</p>
<p>“Indeed?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I wonder, since you are here. Would you be willing to take a look at him? He is suffering, and it may be the Antinium can provide aid.”</p>
<p>“It may be so. Is he here?”</p>
<p>“Resting. <em>Brunkr!</em>”</p>
<p>Krshia raised her voice and called out. Mrsha went very, very still when she heard the name. She hadn’t seen the Gnoll—Krshia’s cousin and warrior of the Silverfang tribe—since…</p>
<p>A door opened slowly in Krshia’s apartment. Mrsha immediately smelled something bad. She tried to get up, but Krshia gently held her on the couch. Klbkch turned as Brunkr entered the room.</p>
<p>The Gnoll warrior was tall, powerful, a classic tribal warrior. Or at least, he had been. The sweaty, unkempt figure that reeked of rot was foreign to Mrsha, and as he stumbled into the room, she heard Krshia snort. Because Brunkr reeked, and the odor was not pleasant.</p>
<p>“Ah. You are injured.”</p>
<p>He smelled like sweat and pain, and something worse. Mrsha backed away as she located the source of the foul odor. Brunkr clutched at his hand, oozing, raw, a foul odor coming from beneath the layers of bandages wrapped around it.</p>
<p>“Aunt. Who is this?”</p>
<p>“A [Guardsman] of the Watch and warrior of the Antinium. He is important, yes? Be respectful.”</p>
<p>Brunkr focused on Klbkch. He nodded slowly.</p>
<p>“I am Brunkr. And I am injured. My hand was bitten. Now…”</p>
<p>He raised his infected hand.</p>
<p>“If I had a quality healing potion—or if my Aunt would buy me one—I would be able to test you in battle, Antinium.”</p>
<p>“Fool! A healing potion will do you no good, no. Rest and cleansing is all we can do now, unless the [Healer] I have asked for will brave the roads.”</p>
<p>Brunkr made a disgusted noise. He was clearly sick. His eyes were unfocused—he didn’t seem to have noticed Mrsha yet.</p>
<p>In his seat, Klbkch nodded at Brunkr.</p>
<p>“A healing potion cannot heal an infection. Miss Krshia is correct. It will only exacerbate the symptoms.”</p>
<p>“Can you help him?”</p>
<p>Krshia looked concerned, for all she snapped at Brunkr to sit and stop messing about. The male Gnoll did so, collapsing onto his seat and grimacing as he held his hand again. Klbkch hesitated, and then shook his head in regret.</p>
<p>“There are serums and substances the Antinium use, but they do not have the same effect on other species. Would a [Healer] not—”</p>
<p>“There are none. None who can help me. The first I brought my hand to said I should burn the wound. I did. But it grew worse, and the others—they tell me it is too late.”</p>
<p>Brunkr gritted his teeth. His eyes refocused, and he stared around, and finally saw Mrsha. His face twisted into a snarl and he surged to his feet.</p>
<p>“You. Doombringer! See what you’ve <em>done?</em>”</p>
<p>Mrsha tore away from Krshia in a panic as Brunkr lurched towards her. Instantly, Krshia and Klbkch were on their feet. Both held Brunkr down and made him sit.</p>
<p>“Nephew. You forget yourself! She is a child!”</p>
<p>“Please calm yourself, Brunkr.”</p>
<p>“She did this! <em>She!</em> She has taken my hand, just like she took her tribe. Cursed one! Deathbringer! <em>Calamity!</em>”</p>
<p>The words broke something deep in Mrsha’s heart. She had felt it all day, but hearing it now was too much. It was all true. She couldn’t run from it no matter how hard she tried.</p>
<p>But she did try. Mrsha turned and leapt off the couch. Krshia grabbed for her, but the Gnoll was too slow. Mrsha dodged around her and the Antinium, who spun and tried to scoop her up. She ran between his legs and though he turned and nearly had her, he wasn’t ready for her to leap <em>off </em>of Krshia’s balcony.</p>
<p>Mrsha landed heavily on all fours. It hurt, but she raced off, ignoring Krshia’s shouts for her to come back. She ran and ran. But she could not outrun the truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrsha cried as she left the city behind. Brunkr’s words cut at her. The Gnoll’s stares pierced her. And the words haunted her.</p>
<p>[Last Survivor]. Level 8. As if she’d asked for this. As if it was a reward.</p>
<p>She just wanted to go back. Back to the inn, where Ryoka would be waiting. Then the girl could tell her a story and Mrsha could—could—</p>
<p>Could pretend she was back home. Her real home, where the fires burned bright every night and where she knew everyone. Where she could run about with the other children and play until Urksh yelled at her. If she could go back, she never would have gone to help gather herbs. She would have stayed in the camp forever, and the Goblins would never have found her. They would never have come and everything would be fine.</p>
<p>Her vision was blurry, but it didn’t matter. Mrsha could smell where she was going. She ran up the hill, towards the inn.</p>
<p>And then away from it. Not there either. She couldn’t be near the Drake, or Lyon with her concern and <em>caring.</em></p>
<p>The past tugged at Mrsha. Seeing other Gnolls reminded her of the people she’d never see again. So she ran far from them, into the snowy landscape, up hills and down valleys, heedless of the danger.</p>
<p>It was a long time before Mrsha finally collapsed, too tired to move any more. She lay in the snow, panting.</p>
<p>No home. Nowhere to go back to. The inn? It wasn’t—Mrsha’s heart hurt. Lyonette wasn’t—</p>
<p>Those who cared about Mrsha got hurt. Or died. Like Ryoka. She’d lost her fingers. She’d gotten hurt for Mrsha and the tribe had died because she’d fallen. Mrsha knew it.</p>
<p>Everyone who tried to help Mrsha died. That was why Ryoka had left. She had left so she wouldn’t die. Because Mrsha wasn’t worth saving.</p>
<p>The Gnoll curled up in the snow, still crying. It was all her fault. All hers.</p>
<p>She barely heard the crunching of snow before the sound was right on top of her. Mrsha uncurled and stared around as she heard the faltering footsteps approaching. She looked around, bewildered, seeing nothing against the white snow.</p>
<p>Then she saw him. Slowly tripping towards her. Stumbling, faltering. Almost falling down. But still in one piece. Still alive.</p>
<p>Toren.</p>
<p>The skeleton looked almost like Brunkr in the way he moved. It was as if he was exhausted, if an undead being could be tired. He seemed as if he would fall apart at any moment.</p>
<p>But the purple flames in his eyes still burned in their sockets. The fire was weak, guttering. But it burned brighter when Toren saw Mrsha. And it was hatred that filled the young Gnoll with terror.</p>
<p>She turned to run. She heard the skeleton rush forwards, but she was dashing away as fast as she could. She raced up a hill and knew the skeleton was in hot pursuit.</p>
<p>Run, run. As fast as you can. But Mrsha had run so far today, and she was exhausted. She slipped going over the crest of a hill, and tumbled down. She scrambled to her feet, and ran forwards—</p>
<p>And nearly fell into the rift in the earth. It was dark, a gaping fissure made nearly invisible by the slight incline in the snow. Mrsha scrambled away from it—</p>
<p>But Toren was right behind her. The skeleton had a bared sword in his hands. He advanced towards her, swinging the sword menacingly. Mrsha backed up, the chasm behind her. She tried to watch Toren and the opening, but he was moving too quick. Mrsha backed up another step and her back paw slipped.</p>
<p>She slid backwards. Mrsha grabbed desperately, and her paws latched onto something beneath the powdered snow. Toren halted, sword in hand, staring at Mrsha as she dangled over the abyss.</p>
<p>Mrsha’s eyes were wide, her arms straining as she tried to hold on. She could barely keep her grip, let alone haul herself up. And the skeleton was just standing there. Just watching her.</p>
<p>He had lowered the sword in his hands. He walked forwards, until he stood right above Mrsha. She waited for him to stab her, but the skeleton just stared down at her.</p>
<p>As if thinking.</p>
<p>And Mrsha wished Ryoka were here. But she knew the girl had left. Gone, far away.</p>
<p>Just like everyone else.</p>
<p>She wanted to go home. But home was gone. And she was alone.</p>
<p>Maybe it was fate. Mrsha felt her claws loosening their grip as the snow fell around her. The skeleton was just staring at her, sword in hand. He took a step forwards.</p>
<p>Chased by bad things.&nbsp;Falling. It was how it had happened last time. But there was no Ryoka anymore. She’d left Mrsha too. And that was a good thing. Because she could not suffer because of Mrsha.</p>
<p>All her fault. White fur. Cursed one. Doombringer. [Last Survivor]. Mrsha sighed. She looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>And then she let go. For a moment she saw the skeleton staring at her, the flames in its purple eyes flickering. It reached out—</p>
<p>But too slowly. The world dropped away from Mrsha and she was tumbling, down, down, into the darkness. The air whistled around her and she closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Mrsha fell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Mrsha?”</p>
<p>Lyon searched the inn, but she couldn’t find the Gnoll. She tried the outhouse, but Mrsha’s tracks led away from there. She ran through the snow. She went to the gates—tried to get in. But Mrsha had left the city. She’d disappeared.</p>
<p>The girl searched. Mrsha was gone. But Lyonette kept searching. She went out into the wilderness and called for the Gnoll until she’d lost her voice. As the cold numbed her, Lyonette kept looking.</p>
<p>“Mrsha? <em>Mrsha! </em>Are you there?”</p>
<p>“Where are you?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was dark when Mrsha woke up. Dark. Hot. Everything hurt.</p>
<p>She cried out. It was the first sound she’d made in a long time. She couldn’t move. She hurt.</p>
<p>And someone was calling for her. Mrsha heard the voice, carried by the wind. A familiar voice.</p>
<p>She wanted to call to it. But something stopped her.</p>
<p>Fear. If she called out the voice would die.</p>
<p>She couldn’t do that. Better to die here.</p>
<p>But it hurt. Mrsha cried. She tried to move. Something was around her. Bad things lurked in the darkness. They were coming.</p>
<p>She had to run. But the voice. Only the voice could save her.</p>
<p>Mrsha looked up. The light was so far away. It seemed like a memory. But she believed the light, the sky was still there.</p>
<p>She wanted to be saved. Mrsha wept. Even if it meant—she just wanted to live.</p>
<p>So she raised her head. Mrsha took a breath and <em>howled</em>. The sound was wordless. It echoed in the dark place she’d fallen into, the dungeon. It went through the skeleton who stood in the darkness, watching her. It travelled up through the rift in the earth and went into the sky.</p>
<p>And Lyonette heard her. Mrsha knew that. She howled and howled, calling out. For salvation. For forgiveness. For another chance.</p>
<p>For life instead of death.</p>
<p>And then she ran, because the things were chasing her. But Mrsha believed she would be saved. She clung to it. That word she barely understood. That feeling in her that was all that stood between her and despair, her and the darkness.</p>
<p>Hope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They stopped her at the gates, a Gnoll and a Drake. But she battered at them with her hands, screamed.</p>
<p>“You <em>have</em> to let me in! I need adventurers! I need help!”</p>
<p>But they held her back. The Gnoll’s face was openly hostile, the Drake’s put upon. They spoke to her, but Lyonette didn’t care.</p>
<p>“<em>Please!</em> Mrsha—she’s down there!”</p>
<p>They didn’t understand. They tried to take her away, force her back. Lyonette hit them. She bit and struggled—even when the Gnoll unsheathed his sword. She would have taken it through her heart if it meant someone would listen.</p>
<p>But the hand that closed over the Gnoll’s arm and pulled the sword away required no sacrifice. Zel Shivertail looked down at Lyon as the Drake [Guardsman] gaped in awe.</p>
<p>“Tell me what’s wrong.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Drake [General] strode through the streets when he heard what had happened. He brought Lyon into the city and summoned the Watch. She ran to the Adventurer’s Guild.</p>
<p>No one there would help her. No one, but a [Scout] who raised his head when he heard her plea. He left his group, and someone came with him.</p>
<p>The Watch called out for aid. They found it. Klbkch walked down into his Hive and spoke to someone waiting there. She and he walked towards the surface.</p>
<p>Lyonette was hurrying towards the gates when the Gnolls appeared. She was afraid, but one of them walked towards her. Krshia had no love for Lyon, but the bow in her hands was not meant for the girl.</p>
<p>And so Lyonette ran through the snow, followed by six people. Six. She prayed it was enough, but there was no time to ask for others. She ran desperately, heart pounding out of her chest. Iron was in her mouth; she seemed to breathe fire each time she inhaled. But she ran faster so that she would be fast enough.</p>
<p>“There.”</p>
<p>She almost cried as she pointed down into the crevice. Zel stared at it grimly.</p>
<p>“Deep. That’s at least a hundred feet down—”</p>
<p>“Far more.”</p>
<p>Halrac stared into the darkness, face grim. He turned to Lyonette.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you heard her down there? If she fell—”</p>
<p>“I’m sure. Please, you have to help!”</p>
<p>“The dungeon is down there.”</p>
<p>Klbkch said the words flatly. Halrac and Zel stared at him, one in alarm, the other confused.</p>
<p>“The dungeon? Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Yes. This place—the location matches a part of the dungeon. And I believe it goes straight down into the heart of it.”</p>
<p>“We can’t go down there unprepared. It would be suicide.”</p>
<p>Halrac bit his lip hard enough to draw blood as he said it. Lyonette stared at him in desperation. But the woman standing next to Halrac gritted her teeth.</p>
<p>“The hell we can’t. I’m going, if you can tie that rope to something secure. No—don’t bother. Just hold it as I go down, Halrac.”</p>
<p>Jelaqua Ivirith hefted the two-handed flail in her hands as she stared at the dungeon grimly. Zel eyed her.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you a Selphid?”</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>She glanced at him challengingly.</p>
<p>“I have a soft spot for children, and those shunned by others. And it seems like this young Gnoll is both. Let me help find her; I’m a Level 33 [Iron Tempest].”</p>
<p>“What class is that?”</p>
<p>“It’s a class derived from [Flailmaster]. I have the Skills to fight a pack of foes at once, if that’s what’s lurking down there. Are you coming or not?”</p>
<p>“I will go.”</p>
<p>Zel nodded at once. Lyonette was nearly in tears—he gripped her hands reassuringly.</p>
<p>“I will enter as well.”</p>
<p>“As will I.”</p>
<p>Two Antinium said that. Klbkch, and an azure one Lyonette had never seen before. She held a staff in her hands and watched Zel as carefully as he ignored her. She inclined her head to him.</p>
<p>“Zel Shivertail. Will you permit me to lend my aid here?”</p>
<p>“Just this once, I will accept your help.”</p>
<p>He said the words coldly as he stared into the darkness. Zel turned.</p>
<p>“Can we anchor the rope to something? Let’s move! Mrsha could be in danger as we speak.”</p>
<p>“Almost done.”</p>
<p>Krshia was helping Halrac fix anchors in the ground for the rope they’d brought. She stood up, bow in hand, and nodded to the rope.</p>
<p>“We will have to hold on, very tightly, going down. Or else we will fall.”</p>
<p>“No need for that. I will cast a [Featherfall] spell and slow us.”</p>
<p>The mysterious Antinium said that. The others looked at her in surprise; none of the others had realized she was a mage.</p>
<p>“Going up will be slower, then.”</p>
<p>“Up can be slow as it must. Down is most important. So let us hurry, no?”</p>
<p>Klbkch hesitated as he looked at Krshia.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you wish to risk this, Miss Krshia? The danger—”</p>
<p>She bared her teeth at him and he shut up.</p>
<p>“She is in danger, and my responsibility. At least in part. I will go.”</p>
<p>“Gather around me.”</p>
<p>Zel, Jelaqua, Klbkch, and Krshia did as Xrn ordered. Jelaqua glanced sideways, and grinned at Halrac.</p>
<p>“Change of heart?”</p>
<p>He just shrugged, face grim.</p>
<p>“If I’d have known we were going into the dungeon, I would have brought everyone. Girl, go back into the city and tell them what’s happened.”</p>
<p>“I will. Thank you! Please—bring her back!”</p>
<p>“We will.”</p>
<p>Several of them said it at the same time. The group looked around and Zel had to bare his teeth ruefully.</p>
<p>“It occurs to me I don’t know who any of you are. Well, the non-Antinium at any rate.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. I hesitate to suggest this, but some of us are more capable than others.”</p>
<p>Klbkch nodded at Zel. Jelaqua just laughed.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about me fighting in close quarters. I can handle myself.”</p>
<p>“Names, then.”</p>
<p>Halrac grunted. He eyed Xrn as the Antinium whispered and raised her staff. No lights flashed, but magic was done.</p>
<p>Slowly, the group walked over to the abyss. They spoke as they stood staring at each other.</p>
<p>“Klbkch the Slayer.”</p>
<p>“Jelaqua Ivirith.”</p>
<p>“Zel Shivertail.”</p>
<p>“Krshia Silverfang.”</p>
<p>“Halrac Everam.”</p>
<p>“Xrn the Small Queen.”</p>
<p>They leapt, and dropped slowly into the crevasse. Mage light bloomed around them, lighting up the rocky walls as they fell further down.</p>
<p>Lyonette watched them go. She prayed, although the gods were dead. She prayed to nothing and everything that Mrsha would be safe. Then she ran towards the city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She heard the call echo in the darkness. Mrsha raised her head, nearly banging her head on the small alcove she was hiding in. Then she howled, as loudly as she could. She heard the answering howl, and then hid herself, curling up to hide from the bad things.</p>
<p>They found her an eternity later. Mrsha flinched when the face moved downwards, but the Drake only smiled wearily when he saw her.</p>
<p>“There you are. Come on, Mrsha. It’s alright.”</p>
<p>She was out of the alcove and in his arms in a second. Zel Shivertail held her as she cried wordlessly into his scales.</p>
<p>“Are you okay? Are you hurt?”</p>
<p>She was fine. Oh, Mrsha had bruised herself all over and cracked bones bouncing down, but she was alive. [Lesser Toughness] had saved her life.</p>
<p>They carried her out of that place. That was all Mrsha knew as she clung to Zel. They were all around her, strangers and friends. Halrac stood with his back to an Antinium whose staff glowed blue. He drew an arrow that glowed with the light of sunset and fired it into the distance. A <em>thump</em> and the roar of an explosion matched the lightning that thundered from her staff.</p>
<p>Jelaqua fought the shadows, flail whirling, striking as she created a deadly curtain of spinning spikes around her. Beside her, Klbkch was a dancing whirlwind of silver blades. Krshia loosed her own arrows, snarling.</p>
<p>And Zel? He carried her past a huge, red worm-like monstrosity. It was dead. It had been torn apart and he walked through the blood as the others fought. And then there was a rope, and a platform conjured out of magic. Zel stood on that, helping Krshia to haul the platform up as Xrn held it in place. Below, Klbkch, Halrac, and Jelaqua climbed rapidly, Halrac pausing to occasionally shoot at something below.</p>
<p>When they saw the light, Mrsha heard a scream. She felt Zel step onto the snow, and then Lyonette was hugging her. The girl crushed Mrsha to her chest, squeezing the breath out of the Gnoll. Hugging, kissing, scolding. Then the others came up and Lyonette prostrated herself before them.</p>
<p>“Oh, <em>thank you, thank you, thank you…</em>”</p>
<p>Mrsha stared up at the faces. Adventurers stood outside the rift in the snow, along with the Watch. Many people were gathered here. Some pointed to the abyss and screamed about danger. Others said it was a way in, a chance.</p>
<p>And many were mad at Mrsha. Some scolded her. Krshia boxed Mrsha’s ears as she checked to make sure the Gnoll was alright and called for another healing potion. And Lyonette was telling Mrsha she’d never, <em>ever</em> let her go out of her sight.</p>
<p>Selys arrived late with Olesm, almost out of her mind with worry. And some people recognized Zel and exclaimed. The strange blue Antinium left in the chaos, and Jelaqua stood alone except for when the others praised her. Lyonette told her to stay at the inn and Jelaqua just smiled. So did Halrac, awkwardly, as if it hurt.</p>
<p>And Mrsha? She looked around and saw many people, happy and sad. But no one was dead. No one.</p>
<p>Not even her.</p>
<p>Lyonette hugged Mrsha again, crying. Mrsha stared at her, and felt something break in her heart. But it wasn’t a bad thing. The thing that broke was a wall, or maybe it was fear itself. She hugged Lyonette back and felt hot tears trickle into her fur. And Mrsha cried too. Because she was safe.</p>
<p>She was finally home.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Sometimes, in the silence of her own mind, Rags knew why her kind was so despised across the world. Privately, she could acknowledge the bitter truth.</p>
<p>Goblins were weak. They didn’t level as much as other races—because they were cowards, too. They lived hand-to-mouth, eating their own dead, fighting each other over scraps. The strongest tribes were still forced to raid the more successful races to survive. Goblins were not creators; they only destroyed.</p>
<p>That was what she had been told. That was what she had known all her life; the contempt of other species. And Rags had believed it. But oh, if they could see what Goblins had wrought here. In this mountain, Goblinkind had built something greater than their miserable existences. They had created something vast, something <em>new.</em></p>
<p>A kingdom. Or perhaps, a new sort of tribe.</p>
<p>That was the only way Rags could think of it. She stared down from the balcony, down a mile to the bottom of the place the Great Goblin Chieftain had claimed as his own. Twisting corridors built into spires of rock that stretched upwards, countless bridges made of rope and stone, and always, always, the hanging lanterns, some unlit, others shedding faint light in the darkness. That was what she saw below her; a vast anarchy stretching downwards, like some strange spider’s web.</p>
<p>She shivered, feeling a chill from respect as much as awe. Never had she ever seen something like this. This mountain had been hollowed out and made into a dwelling place for tens of thousands of Goblins. It had been built, under the leadership of Tremborag, or perhaps he had stolen it and claimed it as his own. Either way, it was a marvel.</p>
<p>And it was also a mystery. How could one tribe be so huge and yet, be ruled only by a Chieftain? This was the first of the things Rags pondered on her second day living in this mountain. Her tribe—and all the tribes around Liscor—had officially allied with Tremborag, and now lived in his home. There was plenty of room to spare.</p>
<p>But back to the Chieftain. Tremborag. He was only the sixth Goblin that Rags had ever known with a name. His tribe was known, fittingly, as the Mountain City Tribe. But Rags had heard him more often referred to as the Great Chieftain’s Tribe.</p>
<p>Great Chieftain. Rags frowned and spat over the edge of the balcony. She didn’t know if she’d hit someone—no doubt she had. One of the dangers of living in this place was that a careless stone or object dropped from on high could turn into instant death for the Goblins moving about below.</p>
<p>How could it be? There was no such thing as a Great Chieftain, at least, as far as Rags knew. To be more precise, such an existence should have been impossible.</p>
<p>Some things all Goblins knew, even odd ones like Garen. You had your tribe, and you were lead by your Chieftain. But…there were other Goblins whose existence was greater than Chieftain. Rags could feel it.</p>
<p>A Goblin Lord was superior to a Chieftain. Their presence unified tribes, drawing Chieftains to them like a magnet. Unless you opposed one with all your might, Rags was sure any Goblin would end up following a Goblin Lord, even a powerful Chieftain.</p>
<p>And a Goblin King? Rags knew without a doubt that if one existed—and one did not, she was sure—every Goblin in the world would follow such a person. The desire for a King, a leader, was built into every Goblin deep down.</p>
<p>So it followed that all Chieftains would eventually become Goblin Lords, and into a Goblin King if they grew strong enough. It wasn’t a choice they would make; it was just nature asserting itself, like how fire burned or how you had to poop after eating.</p>
<p>But then why had Tremborag not become a Goblin Lord? He could become one, Rags was sure. Like the Goblin Lord to the south, he had a tribe too vast for any Chieftain. Yet he was not a Lord. She would have felt it.</p>
<p>It made no sense. Like much in this place, really. Rags turned away from the balcony and walked down into a stone corridor. Two shadows walked after her.</p>
<p>Hobs. The Gold Stone Chieftain and a Hob from his tribe. They were Rags’…bodyguards.</p>
<p>Again, a foreign concept. But Rags had grown to understand that protection was necessary in this place. For while this tribe was Tremborag’s, it was anything but peaceful.</p>
<p>There were…<em>factions</em> in this place. Not other tribes; Tremborag’s had been the only one until Rags and the others had arrived. But the various sub-Chieftains who managed parts of the tribes or led their own bands of warriors fought with each other for influence.</p>
<p>Tremborag was in charge, but there were Hobs and normal Goblins below him who had huge amounts of control over other Goblins. It boggled Rags’ mind to think of it that way, but it made a twisted kind of sense.</p>
<p>There was no way a Chieftain could manage tens of thousands of Goblins. But…if you assumed he was ruling over other, lesser, sub-Chieftains then it might work. It obviously worked. But it made no sense.</p>
<p>“Not Goblin.”</p>
<p>Rags growled the words out loud. The Hob walking behind her flinched, but the bigger, fatter one, didn’t. The Gold Stone Chieftain followed Rags silently, crunching down some rock salt as he walked. He was an odd Hob. He always had something to eat, and he rarely said a word. Actually, that wasn’t uncommon for Goblins, but Rags had noticed the Gold Stone Chieftain’s face rarely changed. He seemed unperturbed by anything.</p>
<p>But he was loyal. Rags was fairly certain of that, and grateful for it. It meant she had some power in this place.</p>
<p>Of course, Rags still ruled over her tribe. Only…where was her tribe? She recognized some of her Goblins scurrying down the corridors, carrying wood, helping butcher animal carcasses—or Goblin bodies. But they were scattered, already becoming absorbed into this place. In a very real sense, Rags no longer had a tribe, only her own small faction.</p>
<p>In some ways, Rags was the exact opposite of Ryoka and more like Erin. She didn’t waste time wondering <em>how</em> all this had happened, she just dealt with the facts. She’d lost her tribe. Tremborag wasn’t her ally and Garen was Garen. She was on her own and she had to find a way to survive in this new place.</p>
<p>As always. In fact, Rags took this new situation to be a challenge, and so dealt with it calmly and in true Goblin fashion. The first thing she did was go exploring, after making sure she wouldn’t be stabbed in the back. The two Hobs helped in that regard.</p>
<p>The mountain was <em>vast</em>. From the outside it was obviously huge, but that was in a climbing sense. Inside, Rags couldn’t help but feel she was in an entirely different world. There was so much space! Goblins had taken what was apparently an abandoned Dwarf city and slowly chipped away at the rock walls and ceiling for decades, perhaps centuries, enlarging this place until it was larger than Esthelm or Celum. Perhaps larger than Liscor.</p>
<p>And like any city, there were places to sleep, places to eat, and places where going to the bathroom was acceptable and places where it was not, although it had to be said Goblins usually didn’t pay attention to that last part. Rags already knew where her and a lot of the new Goblin’s sleeping quarters were; they were higher up near the top.</p>
<p>She sensed this was another slight, or a sign of their weak position in Tremborag’s tribe. Of course, normally higher meant better, but all the really good things like the exits, the main eating halls and the cooking places and forges were further down, which meant Goblins living near the top had further to go. Plus, it was more dangerous high up where you could fall thousands of feet before you went <em>splat</em> on the ground.</p>
<p>Rags didn’t mind the height. She kept away from any place without railings or where she might slip. In short order she located another important place in the mountain, one that was again foreign to most Goblins.</p>
<p>The armory. Rags stared curiously at the four Hobs who stood guard around the doors. She understood vaguely what they were here for. But the presence of the armory herself baffled her.</p>
<p>She took a step towards the doors and the Hobs tensed. Rags raised her hands to show them she wasn’t trying to get in. They relaxed, and a smaller Goblin came scurrying out, waving his arms frantically.</p>
<p>“Can’t go in! Go away!”</p>
<p>He seemed to be in charge of managing the items inside. Rags pointed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why? Why needed?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He looked archly at her.</p>
<p>“For worthy Goblins.”</p>
<p>Rags frowned at his disdain. She’d spoken in Goblin and he’d refused to use it. It seemed almost every Goblin in this place spoke the common tongue, however broken. Speaking in the actual Goblin tongue was looked down upon, it seemed.</p>
<p>And worthy Goblins? Rags supposed that fed into the idea of factions too. Any Goblin with Tremborag’s favor—or a lot of influence—could get what they wanted. Anyone else had to fight for what was left over.</p>
<p>“What is in?”</p>
<p>The small Goblin—small compared to the Hobs, that was, he was still a bit taller than Rags—shrugged.</p>
<p>“Can look.”</p>
<p>The small Goblin meekly approached one of the Hobs. He snorted in irritation, but when he saw Rags and the two Hobs standing at her back he grudgingly opened the door for her to peek inside.</p>
<p>What Rags saw made her eyes widen. Racks of carefully placed swords hung in order of value, from high-quality steel to blades that looked like the metal had been forged by a true master of the craft.</p>
<p>Rags had never heard of Damascus steel, but if Ryoka had been here she would have recognized the superiority of some of the blades. Yet these were less important than the few arms that glowed or sparkled or shone in Rags’ vision as magical artifacts. There were few of these, but the swords were just one section of the armory.</p>
<p>Maces, axes, shields—a collection of bows and armor in all shapes and sizes! Rags saw a pile of books that had to be magical before the Hob shut the door. She stared at him, noting his superior armaments.</p>
<p>“Very good. Tremborag say, you take. Otherwise—not!”</p>
<p>The small Goblin ushered Rags back. She took a few steps and pointed towards the doors.</p>
<p>“Why not give to all Hobs?”</p>
<p>Why not distribute these weapons among all the warriors? Rags knew they could be of use; for every Hob she’d seen walking around with steel weaponry, she saw ten or twenty warriors with little more than sharpened sticks to fight with. If she equipped a force with what she’d seen inside they’d be many times more powerful.</p>
<p>“Only worthy Goblins. Only.”</p>
<p>“Makes no sense.”</p>
<p>Rags frowned at the Goblin, but he just shrugged and motioned her away. Reluctantly, she left. Did Tremborag fear Goblins would attack him if they had those weapons? Or was it just because he wanted to keep them fighting over such riches? Rags could understand that, but it still felt stupid to her. He was hurting his own tribe by keeping such treasures locked away!</p>
<p>No sense. Nonsense. It wasn’t the first time Rags had had that thought here. This mountain was so foreign, and Tremborag’s tribe so alien to her.</p>
<p>Some things made sense. Rags found the huge storage rooms filled with food, preserved by the cold temperatures, and magic runes in a few store rooms! She discovered areas devoted entirely to fletching, or where Goblins would hammer dents out of metal equipment, or clumsily craft things like the lanterns on poles. And of course the huge forge works and kitchens were equally impressive.</p>
<p>But always Rags was reminded that this place was not united. She saw some Goblins wearing ragged armbands, or tattooed with inks on certain parts of their body to differentiate themselves. All of the [Blacksmiths] seemed to be wearing a bracelet or necklace made of chain, for instance. Clearly they were in some faction that had a monopoly on manufactured arms.</p>
<p>And the divisions were clearer when Rags ate that night. She ate again with Tremborag and Garen at the head table—this time no one contested her seat, although she felt hostile glares which she easily ignored.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of eating, Rags glanced at Garen and Tremborag. Both had looked at her a few times, but neither had spoken to her directly. So she raised her voice above the din and spoke to both now.</p>
<p>“When fight Goblin Lord?”</p>
<p>Instantly, the length of the table—all those who had heard Rags—went still. All eyes turned to Tremborag. He looked down at Rags and grinned around a mouthful of bloody meat.</p>
<p>“Ah, you are impatient. Good. But foolish! I have told Garen Redfang this and I will tell you now: if the Goblin Lord comes here we will fight. Otherwise I will not move. It is easy to defend here.”</p>
<p>Rags saw other Goblins nodding at this, but she frowned. She understood the logic—this mountain was a natural stronghold that would take vast numbers of enemies to crack open. But Tremborag really intended to let the Goblin Lord gain strength while he hid here?</p>
<p>She looked at Garen. The Hob had shifted in his seat when Tremborag spoke, but he hadn’t openly opposed the Great Chieftain. Rags did, though. She grabbed some cheese and bit into it, chewing and speaking around her mouthful.</p>
<p>“Should go. Send army. I will go. As leader.”</p>
<p>It was a blatant challenge. Rags would gladly fight with an army against the Goblin Lord and level if Tremborag was too cowardly to. But he just laughed hugely, making his layers of fat vibrate and bounce.</p>
<p>“Ah, but who would follow you into battle? One or two Hobs? Your small tribe’s warriors?”</p>
<p>Tremborag pointed down the table at the Gold Stone Chieftain eating with the few Hobs and warriors loyal to Rags.</p>
<p>“The Goblin Lord would swat you like a bug, small Rags.”</p>
<p>He laughed and everyone at the table besides Garen laughed too. Rags bit her tongue. She had seen the bugs that lived around Liscor. Some were acid flies and they exploded when you swatted them. But she waited for Tremborag to finish laughing. He gestured at his hall full of Goblins.</p>
<p>“You can do nothing, not even with the legendary Garen Redfang. But I have an army as strong as the Goblin Lord’s. Stronger.”</p>
<p>She wasn’t sure if that was true. But Tremborag’s words had roused his warriors. They banged on the tables, shouting until he raised a hand. The Great Chieftain pointed at Rags, his voice booming.</p>
<p>“You want to fight the Goblin Lord? Well then. My warriors, my Hobs! Who would fight with Rags? Who would give her their warriors to command?”</p>
<p>Not a single one of the Goblins sitting at the high table moved. Rags didn’t blush; she just narrowed her eyes at Tremborag as he grinned toothily at her.</p>
<p>“You see? You have no power here.”</p>
<p>“I…<em>lead</em>. I am smart. I lead armies!”</p>
<p>She retorted. Tremborag laughed.</p>
<p>“You lead? Yes, you have [Tactician]. Garen said. Good. Then we shall see if you are as skilled as Redfang claims. Later.”</p>
<p>He waved a hand, and the conversation was done. Rags sat and pushed the rest of the cheese into her mouth, washing it down with some kind of pulpy juice, fuming. That was how it was, was it? Tremborag had just told her she had no power.</p>
<p>She was angry, but the rich food cheered Rags up. Clearly rank had its privileges here. Rags could look at the other Goblins in the huge throne room and see far less sumptuous food available to them. Indeed, some of the hungrier-looking Goblins glanced longingly at those eating at the high table. They had to make do with raw mushrooms, rats, and mass-produced soup that looked like the worst of the meals Rags had eaten when she was young.</p>
<p>Now that she was more able to take in her surroundings, Rags looked around and counted Hobs. Yes, a lot of them. Over a hundred. Perhaps hundreds of them walked Tremborag’s halls, given that not all Goblins ate at the same time. It was a huge force, but again, a fractured one.</p>
<p>And most of the Hobs were young. As were most of the Goblins, in truth. In this place which was relatively safe, Goblins still didn’t have long lifespans.</p>
<p>Then again…Rags had never seen an old Goblin, and she knew some, like the Gold Stone Chieftain, were over ten years old, which <em>was</em> old for a Goblin. But they looked like any other Hob—they didn’t really show their age.</p>
<p>Except for one. Rags’ attention was caught by a Goblin sitting in a corner of the room. He was seated not at a table but on the ground, a sign of his inferiority. But he—</p>
<p>He was <em>old</em>. Rags saw he actually had a beard. Some Goblins had hair, but she hadn’t known Goblins could grow <em>beards</em>. But it was white and scraggly and dirty, and it kept getting into the bowl of soup he was eating with his bare hands.</p>
<p>She wrinkled her nose as she watched the old Goblin eat. He was messy, even by Goblin standards. He had a few teeth, but many were missing. He ate the scraps served to him greedily, laughing and chattering away with the filthy Goblins around him. For some reason, they all looked female.</p>
<p>Another…faction. She supposed only a very weak one would want a Goblin like him. But it was a sign that some Goblins could live for a long time in this place. Outside, elderly Goblins would simply fall behind or die to monsters or in battle as a matter of course. Again, not that Rags had ever seen one remotely as old as him.</p>
<p>At the table, the feast was still going on, but Rags wasn’t hungry. She had a smaller belly than any of the other Goblins at the table. She was young. And small. And no one was paying attention to her. That was how she’d been relegated, Rags realized.</p>
<p>Tremborag and Garen kept their own council and talked to each other in private, and Rags apparently wasn’t important enough to be included in any other discussions. Not that there was anything important happening since they weren’t going to war yet.</p>
<p>The Great Chieftain and Garen seemed more interested in the little key he possessed. Rags could sense they had some pact of their own, although neither one of them said anything. They just laughed and ate hugely, boasting of their abilities and achievements as they ate.</p>
<p>She had to admit, she didn’t have the qualities to attract a following out of sheer might. Rags thought about this as she idly sipped more of her drink. She was smart and her tribe was strong, but that mattered little here it seemed. If only she was better with a sword or magic! She was learning both, but slowly. Meanwhile, the two sitting ahead of her were far more powerful than she was.</p>
<p>Garen was as strong as any Gold-rank adventurer, despite only possessing a magical sword and no armor or rings she could see. Mounted, he was a nightmare to fight thanks to his Skills, and it was clear that he was probably the most powerful Goblin in this place besides Tremborag himself.</p>
<p>As for the Great Goblin…he could probably just roll over and crush any adventurer he came across. Rags had no idea how strong he was, but she guessed that if she’d shot him with her black crossbow, the bolt wouldn’t have gone through all his layers of fat.</p>
<p>After dinner, Rags went back to her quarters and sat, dismissing the Gold Stone Chieftain and Hob. She had to think. Here she was in a new environment, and she needed to gain influence. It wasn’t about war and fighting any longer—it was about being respected.</p>
<p>She’d never had to worry about that in her tribe, even when she wasn’t Chieftain. Rags stared at the stone ceiling, feeling odd. When she was just a Goblin, even if things were bad she was still a Goblin like anyone else. If they were running they all had a chance. There was only the Chieftain and the other Goblins. Other warriors didn’t have more…<em>rights.</em> If they ate more food it was because they fought and needed the energy, not because they were special.</p>
<p>Rags had seen warriors eating scraps in that room along with normal laboring Goblins. It was all about power, here. Power, which divided a tribe against itself.</p>
<p>She didn’t like it. But she didn’t have to like it to use it to her advantage. Rags rolled over and slept, dreaming of ways she could gain influence in this mockery of a tribe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day, Rags met the chief [Shaman] of Tremborag’s tribe. Or rather, the [Shaman] found her. It was surprise visit, but when Rags saw the female Hob wearing paint on her mostly unclothed body and little else, she immediately made time for her.</p>
<p>She was very nearly naked. Rags had never met another Goblin shaman, so she had no idea if this was customary, but it didn’t seem practical unless they all stayed indoors in the winter. Paint—some kind of chalky colored substance—decorated the female Hob’s skin, creating exotic patterns that hypnotized the eye.</p>
<p>And other body parts, it seemed. For all the male Goblins the [Shaman] passed—and a good deal of the females—stared with acute interest at her, both at the parts seen and the parts hinted at.</p>
<p>Rags was young, so she didn’t care. But she was suddenly acutely aware of how other Goblins cared about looks. The Gold Stone Chieftain grunted approvingly as he stared at the [Shaman]’s backside. Rags didn’t see the point so she only scowled when the Goblins impeded their progress with appreciative ogling.</p>
<p>This was a type of power too, and the [Shaman] flaunted it. That made Rags a bit wary when the Shaman led her to her large and sumptuous quarters, making the two Hobs wait outside.</p>
<p><em>She</em> had pillows, lots of them. And part of her room was clearly devoted to her craft; Rags saw a lot of items that wouldn’t have looked unfamiliar on an [Alchemist]’s table. She gazed around in interest as the [Shaman] talked with her.</p>
<p>“You are Rags. A new Goblin and a Chieftain. So young!”</p>
<p>Rags nodded, meeting the other Goblin’s gaze calmly. She had power too, Rags sensed.</p>
<p>“You had no Shaman in any of your tribes. Have you never met a Shaman before?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>She was very fluent, while Rags had to struggle to make herself understood. The [Shaman] smiled sadly.</p>
<p>“It is not good. Shamans make a tribe strong. Without us, there is only Chieftains and all they can do is hit things.”</p>
<p>That made Rags smile. The [Shaman] whispered a word, and a ball of light floated from her hands, colors—red, white, green, black—blurring together in a light show. Rags stared at it appreciatively.</p>
<p>“We have power. We take it from the tribe. You know this?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Magic. Like this?”</p>
<p>Rags raised her hand and cast the [Light] spell. The [Shaman] gasped as an orb—perfectly mirroring the one she’d made—floated out of Rags’s palm. The Goblin smiled; she wasn’t so easily impressed by parlor tricks.</p>
<p>“You have magic. No one told me this.”</p>
<p>Which told Rags that she was being gossiped about. She shrugged.</p>
<p>“[Shaman] magic. Is like [Mage]?”</p>
<p>“Yes. And no. Different. My magics are basic, but strong with numbers. I can cast lightning and burn and create shields. And heal.”</p>
<p>“Heal?”</p>
<p>That attracted Rags’ interest. Pisces had taught her the fundamentals of magic and he had told her that healing spells were extremely advanced spells for mages.</p>
<p>The Shaman nodded.</p>
<p>“Close flesh. Restore blood. Not fix a missing arm, though. Still useful.”</p>
<p>“Very.”</p>
<p>Rags thought about how many healing potions she could save with a [Shaman]. She pointed to the female Hob.</p>
<p>“Only you? One Shaman?”</p>
<p>“I am Ulvama. Another five [Shamans] are in the tribe, but I am strongest by far. They can throw fire. I can scorch the earth.”</p>
<p>So you could have more than one if your tribe was big enough. Rags wondered if she could persuade a [Shaman] to join her tribe, or if Ulvama could teach someone. Could she learn?</p>
<p>“It is good that you think.”</p>
<p>Ulvama interrupted Rags’ thought. The [Shaman] leaned forwards and smiled at Rags, as if the two of them were sharing a secret.</p>
<p>“You are smart. And brave. I saw you challenging the Hob. But Tremborag does not think you are important.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Rags scowled. Ulvama smiled deeper.</p>
<p>“But I do. You need support. Allies. I can be your ally.”</p>
<p>Rags held still. She eyed Ulvama cautiously. A [Shaman], much less the chief [Shaman] of Tremborag’s tribe would be very useful. But why did Ulvama want to help Rags? Did she really see something in her, as she was hinting?</p>
<p>Or did she do this to all Chieftains? Was she just playing the odds or did she want something? Rags didn’t know, but she wasn’t one to spit on an offered hand.</p>
<p>Unless it was someone she hated, like Relc.</p>
<p>“Ally is good.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I can speak to other leaders for you. They are not certain if you should be followed or fought. But I can persuade them.”</p>
<p>Rags was under no illusions as to how Ulvama would do that. She frowned; she’d had the birds and bees explained to her by Erin of all people, although she had no idea why birds would mate with bees. But would the offer of sex really persuade so many?</p>
<p>“Will work?”</p>
<p>Ulvama laughed.</p>
<p>“You are young so you do not know. But it will work, especially since you have a name. That makes you special.”</p>
<p>Rags nodded proudly. A name was rare, even if the tribe had a [Shaman], she had learned. It was a mark of influence, and here, of power.</p>
<p>“One thing is strange, though. You have no Shaman but you have a name. Did you come from another tribe? Or did your Shaman die?”</p>
<p>Rags shook her head.</p>
<p>“No [Shaman]. Human gave it to me.”</p>
<p>Ulvama’s eyes widened. She stared at Rags, and then she shook her head sadly.</p>
<p>“Then it is not a proper name.”</p>
<p>Rags stared at Ulvama, shocked. She hadn’t <em>liked</em> the name Erin had given her, but it had stuck and she had long since taken it as her own. It was her name!</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“Only Shamans can give names. Not Humans.”</p>
<p>Ulvama said it as if it were obvious. Rags didn’t think this made sense and said so.</p>
<p>“My name.”</p>
<p>“I can give you a better one.”</p>
<p>“No. My name.”</p>
<p>The two stared at each other, the good mood in the room evaporating like dew. After a moment, Ulvama looked away. She spoke more directly and with less smiles.</p>
<p>“You will need to gain support from other warriors. Find strong ones; make them your allies or make them yours.”</p>
<p>“How? Give things?”</p>
<p>Rags had an idea of how to gain power. Bribing followers, rewarding the faithful, demonstrating ability in combat and elsewhere—but Ulvama shook her head dismissively.</p>
<p>“Use that.”</p>
<p>To Rag’s surprise and outrage she reached out and poked Rags between the legs. The Goblin closed her legs instantly and glared at Ulvama.</p>
<p>“That is mine.”</p>
<p>She had no interest in sex, especially the way Erin described it. Goblins knew about the link between sex and babies of course; it was hard to miss the connection. But while Rags would have been considered a fine age for giving birth, she didn’t want to. It seemed like a pain.</p>
<p>“It is the best way for females. Do not be stupid.”</p>
<p>The Shaman was waspish. She stared at Rags and the Goblin glared back.</p>
<p>“Sleep with others. Garen Redfang if you can. He will help you for that—all do. Do not be—”</p>
<p>She was reaching for Rag’s legs. Rags slapped Ulvama’s hand down. The Shaman gasped in outrage. She raised a hand to strike Rags.</p>
<p>And Rags kicked her.</p>
<p>Kicking was better than a punch, mainly because people often watched your hands. Rags’s foot slammed into Ulvama’s stomach and the Goblin doubled over, coughing in pain. Rags sneered as she stood over Ulvama. The other Goblin was soft, lazy for all her power.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>When the Shaman looked up there was murder in her eyes. Rags stared down at Ulvama coldly, ready for a fight. She did not want to sleep with anyone, and she had no intention of being told what to do. Ulvama’s eyes blazed. She gathered magic to her in a wave, hissing with anger, ready to blast this upstart Chieftain.</p>
<p>But Rags had a hand on her sword and the [Firefly] spell burning in her hand. The [Shaman] looked at Rags and the smaller Goblin knew she was wondering if she would be quick enough with her spells, or if Rags would stab her first.</p>
<p>“Get out.”</p>
<p>That was all Ulvama said. Rags nodded. She doubted the [Shaman] would be cowardly enough to strike her from behind. She walked towards the door. Then she turned at it.</p>
<p>“I need no name. I have one.”</p>
<p>The door slammed as Rags left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rags felt upset and annoyed for hours after meeting Ulvama. She’d been hoping so badly for help, and Ulvama had offered it! But not only had the Shaman denied her name, she’d tried to force Rags to do something she didn’t want to, as if she had no choice. She was no true ally, and Rags had been right to not join up with her.</p>
<p>But however good it had felt to kick Ulvama, the consequences of Rags’ actions were immediately obvious. When she received the summons to meet Tremborag with the other Goblins to plan a raid on a Human settlement, Rags found a room full of Goblin warriors standing around a map.</p>
<p>In this, Rags could find no fault. She stared appreciatively at the map of the local area and, of all things, crude figurines arranged around a town on the big stone table. It was a tool for planning attacks, and Rags saw Garen leaning over the table as Tremborag spoke with a Hob who was pushing pieces around.</p>
<p>When he saw Rags, though, Tremborag grinned at her. She saw other Goblins in the room turn to laugh at her as well and felt uneasy.</p>
<p>“Ah! Fake Name Goblin! Come.”</p>
<p>Rags froze mid-step towards the table. She stared at Tremborag. The Goblin laughed at her with his eyes and mouth. She glared at him.</p>
<p>“I am Rags.”</p>
<p>“That is not what Ulvama said. She said your name was given to you by a <em>Human.</em>”</p>
<p>So, this was the Shaman’s revenge. Rags gritted her teeth, but she knew arguing was pointless. She pushed her way towards the table and stared at the pieces.</p>
<p>“Attack?”</p>
<p>“A raid. A Human town has many supplies and much food for the winter. I want it. But it is defended by many soldiers and some adventurers. See.”</p>
<p>He pointed to the map. All business now, Rags listened as another Goblin explained the rough layout of the town. It wasn’t an easy place to attack by any means, she could tell. Stone walls, enchantments on the gates and even a tower spelled to hurl fire—add the Human defenders and she would have avoided it with her tribe.</p>
<p>But Tremborag had the forces to take the town, and he wanted what was within. He pointed towards the board where a self-satisfied Goblin had arranged the pieces in a rough circle around the city, their means of attack.</p>
<p>“What do you think, Fake Name Goblin? Garen says you are the best strategist. Can you come up with a better plan?”</p>
<p>In an instant she could. Rags took one look at the proposed formation and swept it aside. The Goblin made an outraged sound, but she knew his plan had been terrible. All he wanted to do was attack from every side, as if that would immediately overwhelm the stout defenses of the town.</p>
<p>In this, Tremborag’s Goblins were equal to any other Tribe. Rags sneered as she moved the pieces around. In short order she had a plan of attack that had Garen nodding approvingly. Feint a heavy assault on the gates while other forces surrounded the city. Then—feint a second attack with lots of Hobs on the west wall while the east side saw Goblins snipe the defenders there and rush ladders up with the main strike force.</p>
<p>There were all kinds of other details of course, and Rags went through each phase of the plan. She paused when she came to the defenders, though.</p>
<p>“Adventurers in city?”</p>
<p>“A few. Not nearly as many as the soldiers, though.”</p>
<p>Tremborag grinned at her. He’d been watching her work in silence. Rags carefully added a few groups of Goblins and Hobs to suppress the small group of adventurers and stood back.</p>
<p>The other Goblins in the room stared at her plan of attack with grudging approval. Garen grinned openly and nudged Tremborag.</p>
<p>“You see?”</p>
<p>“I do. Well then, small Goblin. It seems you are capable of being a Chieftain after all.”</p>
<p>Rags bared her teeth at the backhanded compliment. He wasn’t going to call her by her name ever again, was he?</p>
<p>Tremborag smiled as he stared around.</p>
<p>“Get ready for battle, my warriors! We will attack with many Goblins—and I will go as well.”</p>
<p>This caused a stir among the Goblins in the room, and in moments all were volunteering to go with Tremborag. He chose only enough for the force Rags had proposed and then looked directly at her.</p>
<p>“And you will come too. After all, it is your plan.”</p>
<p>She nodded. Rags felt a bit of excitement burning in her, along with guilt. She’d be killing Humans. But this was a chance to prove herself! She looked Tremborag in the eye and bared her teeth.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They mustered outside of the town just before evening. It wasn’t far to go, hence Tremborag’s desire to attack the town and the Goblins moved fast anyways. Rags found herself relegated to one of the side units, away from most of the fighting. She resented that, but comforted herself in the knowledge that this <em>was</em> her plan.</p>
<p>Rags stood in the snow, shivering a bit in the leather armor she was wearing—it was very cold—and staring around. A group of warriors, including Tremborag, had been gathered for the decisive actual attack on the eastern walls. They were hiding in a copse of trees. Garen Redfang would attack the western walls with some Hobs so he was not present.</p>
<p>In truth, neither Tremborag nor Garen were needed for this battle. Rags had gone over the plans; they had brought two Goblins for every one Human, and only some of the defenders could fight. It would be a slaughter either way; it only depended on how many Goblins their side lost in this battle.</p>
<p>To Rags’ mild surprise, the group she was leading—one of the groups that would go into the city and tie up the Human soldiers—contained a spellcaster like herself. Only, the drooling Goblin who had to be prodded along by one of Tremborag’s warriors was very unlike her.</p>
<p>For one thing, he had no ears. Someone had cut them off of him, leaving two earholes instead. Rags felt angry when she saw that; she knew some adventurers earned money from Goblin ears. Maybe one of them had done it to this Goblin.</p>
<p>The Goblin stumbled towards Rags and stared at her blankly. She looked at him in disgust and turned to one of the warriors in her group.</p>
<p>“Why bring?”</p>
<p>The warrior shrugged as he examined his chipped sword.</p>
<p>“Stupid. Head is bad. But can cast spell.”</p>
<p>Rags stared at the drooling Goblin in doubt. He turned his head blankly towards her and grunted.</p>
<p>“Ah. Ugn.”</p>
<p>She wrinkled her nose and turned away. Ahead of her, Tremborag gave the signal and wild horn calls suddenly rent the air around her. The attack had begun.</p>
<p>The Human town had been peacefully going about its daily routine, safe in the knowledge that so many soldiers and adventurers were gathered here to guard it. But in moments a savage Goblin attack shattered their bubble of complacency. The soldiers on the walls shot down at the masses of Goblins with shields, doing little damage. Goblins swarmed all around, but the Human commander, whoever he was, quickly realized the main push was coming from the western walls.</p>
<p>Horns blew, men and women shouted orders, and the Goblins in the trees saw the bulk of the defenders go to fight off the Hobs that were assaulting the west side. Now was the time.</p>
<p>Standing in the back of the ranks of Goblins, Rags only heard the cut off screams as Goblins with high [Archer] levels shot the Humans on the walls and more Goblins rushed forwards with ladders. Tremborag shouted, and suddenly everyone was running.</p>
<p>Rags raced with her group to a ladder and climbed it nimbly. Above her a warrior choked as an arrow caught him in the chest; he fell and nearly knocked the dimwitted Goblin down with him. Rags cursed and had to pull the stupidly grinning Goblin up.</p>
<p>Then they were on the walls and in the main town itself. Rags ran with the warriors and two archers down one of the streets; they would stop any of the soldiers trying to help the others.</p>
<p>In less than a minute Rags saw the first soldiers breaking away from fighting at the gates and walls to fight the Goblins in the city. But they were fragmented, caught off-guard. More of them rushed at the Goblins who’d braced themselves in the streets.</p>
<p>Goblin archers shot at the soldiers. So did Rags. She still had her black crossbow, and it killed one Human, sending him flying backwards and making the others raise their shields in alarm. But she didn’t have time to reload it so Rags drew her sword and shield instead.</p>
<p>Before the diminished Human force could clash with the Goblins, the dimwitted Goblin was thrust forwards by the others. They shouted at him and he smiled and pointed towards the Human advance. Rags saw his hands light up—</p>
<p>And then bolts of electricity shot across the street, striking the Humans, making them cry out in agony. Rags was surprised, but the other Goblins had waited for this moment. After the stupid Goblin lowered his hands they rushed forwards, shouting.</p>
<p>Sparks of electricity crawled over the Humans in armor, making their arms weak as their muscles spasmed from the shocks. Rags shouted as she ran, and threw a [Firefly] spell at the Human in front of her. He screamed as the flying fire burned him, and then Rags cut his leg and slashed his chest.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a clean kill. She cut him eight times, dodging backwards as he struck at her, screaming. But like the other Humans he was soon dead, overwhelmed by the Goblin’s knowledge and superior tactics.</p>
<p>Satisfied, Rags and the other Goblins stepped back, some of them retrieving better quality weapons from the dead. She looked around. Two Goblins had taken injuries, one fairly bad, but none of them had died despite fighting so many Humans. True, they were strong warriors for Goblins, but this was <em>easy.</em></p>
<p>Then Rags heard the shouts and felt the earth shaking. She turned and saw the adventurers.</p>
<p>There were only a handful of them, Tremborag had said. Only a handful. But when Rags saw the Goblins who went flying like leaves her heart caught in her chest. Somehow, in some way, the Goblins who had scouted this city had failed to mention one crucial fact, or perhaps Tremborag had failed to mention it to Rags.</p>
<p>These were <em>Gold</em>-rank adventurers, not Silver.</p>
<p>As Rags watched, a roaring man with a battleaxe swung, and the ranks of Goblins sent to hold him back went flying. They were like children before his strength, even the Hobs. At his side, a huge woman with a hammer crushed a Hob’s head, smashing right through the shield he’d held up to guard himself.</p>
<p>They were going to tear right through the Goblin forces in the city! Rags was paralyzed by indecision. They had to be slowed. But the Goblins with her couldn’t manage it! They had to get to Garen, get him into the city with as many Hobs as possible—</p>
<p>Then she heard a <em>roar</em> which made the two Gold-rank adventurers freeze in fear. Rags turned.</p>
<p>And saw Tremborag.</p>
<p>At first, Rags didn’t recognize the Goblin. That was because the Hob had changed entirely. A gargantuan creature, made of muscle and rage charged down the street. Eight feet tall, huge legs cracking the cobblestones as he ran at the adventurers—</p>
<p>It was the Great Chieftain of the Mountain. Yes, it was. Some of his features were the same. But all the fat had been changed to muscle, and he had become powerful, <em>quick—</em></p>
<p>The warrior with the hammer raised it with a shout, but she was too slow. Tremborag caught her as he charged and smashed <em>into</em> a house. Rags flinched as wood and stone exploded like hail, and the warrior rushed in after his friend. She and the other Goblins heard shouting, then a scream. A female one. Then a man’s choking voice—</p>
<p>In the localized sphere of silence, Tremborag walked out of the destroyed house. There was blood on his hands and around his mouth. The Goblins around Rags backed away as he walked towards her.</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>That was all she said to the Goblin who stared down at her. Not a Hobgoblin, not a normal Goblin—something else. Some aspect of Goblin she had never heard of before. Tremborag smiled at Rags, and she saw the flesh caught in his teeth. His voice hadn’t changed much, but it was rougher, harsher, as if speaking came harder to him in this form.</p>
<p>“There are more things in this world that you do not know than know, little Goblin. I am one of them.”</p>
<p>Then he turned and ran towards where the sound of battle was thickest. Rags stared at his back. She said not a word as the slow Goblin laughed and pointed at something.</p>
<p>Her knees were shaking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When she saw Tremborag again, he was fat and normal, as if what she’d seen was an illusion. He stood, laughing and eating something amid his cheering warriors. They’d killed the last of the Humans and the rest had either fled or—</p>
<p>Rags still heard screaming, from female voices. She knew what was happening and it bothered her although she felt it shouldn’t. But she was more concerned with Tremborag right now. She approached hesitantly.</p>
<p>“Ah! There you are.”</p>
<p>He turned to her almost jovially as Garen Redfang joined them, covered in blood and lightly wounded, but steaming in the cold air with battle lust. Tremborag greeted Garen and then turned to Rags, smiling condescendingly down at her.</p>
<p>“Not bad, little Goblin. Not good either, though; you underestimated the adventurers. They are stronger than the ones you know.”</p>
<p>She hadn’t been <em>told</em> about them being Gold-rank! She should have assumed, but this had been a setup. Rags bit her tongue; she didn’t feel able to talk back to Tremborag after what she’d witnessed.</p>
<p>The Great Goblin Chieftain stared down at her, musingly. He was in a good mood from the easy victory, and so he was magnanimous towards her.</p>
<p>“You are useful, as Garen said. You have my respect. Pick first and claim whatever you want before the others.”</p>
<p>He waved his hand to indicate the city. Rags just nodded and turned away. She avoided the places where she heard Humans screaming and Goblins shouting in delight and searched among the dead, feeling wrong on different levels.</p>
<p>To her annoyance, anything remotely magical had already been claimed by Tremborag or one of his Hobs. Rags hunted about and found a wicked axe made of steel, a valuable weapon. But she didn’t keep it for herself.</p>
<p>Instead, upon returning to the mountain with all their spoils, Rags searched for the Gold Stone Chieftain. He hadn’t been included on the raid. But she gave the steel axe to the Gold Stone Chieftain, who immediately discarded the somewhat blunted iron axe he’d been using in favor of this one.</p>
<p>It was a good move, Rags knew. It showed the other Goblins she rewarded her followers, and that she wasn’t greedy like others. She felt proud of her decision—and immediately angry that she had to make it to fight for influence here. And she still felt a bit wrong.</p>
<p>Because of the Human women.</p>
<p>They’d been captured, over a hundred of them. Many civilians had fled or been killed, but some had been captured. The men had been killed, or so Rags believed. But the women—</p>
<p>They were somewhere in the mountain. Somewhere, being raped. That was what Rags knew, and she tried to not think about it too hard.</p>
<p>It wasn’t her business. Some goblins did that. Garen’s tribe didn’t and she hadn’t had to face the issue with her tribes yet, but—</p>
<p>She was too busy fighting for influence here to worry about Humans! Rags considered her new state of affairs as she grumpily ate food by herself. She had declined to go to the throne hall to feast; she was instead eating in a smaller room where Goblins could choose to take their meals.</p>
<p>The battle had been a victory, a huge success, it was true. But somehow, it wasn’t <em>her</em> victory. Rags had planned the battle and it had gone well, and for that she sensed her value as a strategist had been established.</p>
<p>But Tremborag had altered perceptions by tricking her! Instead of a flawless battle, she’d been portrayed as stupid to forget the Gold-rank adventurers, lessening her worth. She had still gained from this, but—</p>
<p>Rags looked up as a Goblin stumbled into the room she was sitting in. No Goblin had chosen to eat here but her; they were all gorging themselves in the throne room with Tremborag. But someone had decided to eat here.</p>
<p>The dimwitted Goblin. He looked around vacantly, holding a bowl of soup in his hands. He spotted Rags and lurched towards her, smiling stupidly. Rags gritted her teeth, but she didn’t kick him away as he sat near to her. He gulped his soup greedily, his eyes unfocused.</p>
<p>She tried to ignore him. Rags was still thinking about the Human women. She’d seen them, although she hadn’t intended to, forced along at sword-point, some naked. A few had tried to kill themselves fighting rather than be taken, but they’d been overwhelmed and—</p>
<p>Not her business. Rags gritted her teeth. She stabbed angrily at the bloody meat on her plate. It was from a sheep and it was hot. She should eat it and find Ulvama. Maybe she could beat the stupid Shaman into—</p>
<p>“Flowing Water Chieftain. Will you speak with me?”</p>
<p>Rags <em>jerked</em> in surprise. She twisted, and saw the dimwitted Goblin without ears looking at her. Straight <em>at </em>her. And his eyes were no longer unfocused. Her hand went to her sword, but the other Goblin hadn’t moved to hurt her. She stared as the mindless, gibbering wreck suddenly sat up and stared at her with keen, piercing intelligence.</p>
<p>“You.”</p>
<p>“I.”</p>
<p>He agreed, smiling at her. Rags stared at him warily and slowly let go of her sword.</p>
<p>“Act.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>They stared at each other. Rags’ mind worked at the speed of light.</p>
<p>“Why pretend?”</p>
<p>“Hiding. I am [Spellcaster] to them. Weak. Stupid. But I am [Mage] to you. Stronger than I seem.”</p>
<p>“Why speak to me?”</p>
<p>“Because you are different. I am taking risk. Would like to give you advice.”</p>
<p>Rags paused. She stared at him and thought of the difference between his approach and Ulvama’s. She nodded slowly.</p>
<p>“Tell.”</p>
<p>“Do not sit with Tremborag tonight. Do not be proud. Be humble. Small.”</p>
<p>Her eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>He smiled at her, exposing missing teeth.</p>
<p>“Is better that way. You are <em>too</em> smart, too quick. You may be threat, you foreign Chieftain. And if you are…Tremborag will crush his enemies with more than fists.”</p>
<p>Rags considered this. It made sense. Tremborag was deliberately testing her, diminishing her worth. It might be a better move to pretend to be cowed by his displays of strength, although she hadn’t considered it before. She narrowed her eyes at the other Goblin. And yet…</p>
<p>He was strong. If he was a better spellcaster than he pretended to be, he was on the level of any Hob in terms of value, perhaps more. He could be powerful. She pointed at him accusingly.</p>
<p>“Why you not fight? Why not stand proud? Why…<em>coward?</em>”</p>
<p>“I tried.”</p>
<p>He tapped his ragged earholes and grinned at her. Rags paused. She stared at his ears.</p>
<p>Adventurers cut off Goblin ears. For that, <em>they</em> were monsters. But she had never heard of Goblins doing it to each other. Goblins killed one another as necessary. They did not mutilate. They did not torture.</p>
<p><em>But they did rape Humans.</em></p>
<p>She banished the thought. Rags stared at the Goblin [Mage] and nodded slowly.</p>
<p>“I will think. And not tell.”</p>
<p>“Good. Think hard, strange Chieftain.”</p>
<p>That was all he said. She and he went back to their meals. When they were done, Rags stood up.</p>
<p>The Goblin stared at her. His eyes were unfocused again and he grunted seemingly in surprise when she moved past him.</p>
<p>“Ugn.”</p>
<p>He stared at her vacantly. This time Rags was not fooled. She nodded to him and strode off, thinking hard.</p>
<p>That night, Rags didn’t go to the high table. She instead ate with the Gold Stone Chieftain in a far more crowded part of the hall, as if she was cowed and humbled by her mistakes. She sensed countless eyes on her, but did and said little. She was thinking and watching instead.</p>
<p>Next to her, the Gold Stone Chieftain ate his food as stolidly as ever. He didn’t react to Rags’ presence; he’d just scooted over when she’d walked over without a word. Only one thing he’d done had surprised her that night.</p>
<p>When they’d been eating the Gold Stone Chieftain had stopped a passing Goblin. The old one. He was…or had been…a Hob, but he looked pathetic compared to all the others. But the Gold Stone Chieftain had called out to him nevertheless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Old one. Sit.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so Rags found herself sitting across from the old Goblin. He ate messily, burped loudly, and said little; he annoyed Rags more than anything else because he kept staring at her. So did all the other Goblins, to be fair.</p>
<p>She could tell that her absence from the high table had been noted. By everyone. Rags hoped the other Goblins just interpreted it as her being ashamed and going to her actual position in the hierarchy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the ranks of the Goblins were stabilizing as the new additions to Tremborag’s tribe were assimilated. And it was his tribe, Rags realized. They were becoming his.</p>
<p>Already the Redfang warriors sat at the high table. A good number of them sat high up, bearing new scars from quick duels to assert their superiority. But as always Garen sat right next to Tremborag, clearly displaying his dominance.</p>
<p>She’d heard what had happened. Garen had killed another Hob, one of Tremborag’s stronger followers in a quick fight. He already had his own band of followers, and Rags wondered if he’d picked a fight with the unfortunate Hob on purpose.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the only big news of the day. As Rags slept and woke, she heard the second big impact of yesterday’s battle circulating through the mountain. Namely, the Human women who’d been captured.</p>
<p>They had been taken to a part of the mountain Rags had never visited. A dungeon-like place, where Goblins could come and go. Here too, access was restricted to those with favor. Normal Goblins couldn’t enter, but more influential Goblins could access the women.</p>
<p>It bothered Rags more than she could say. But to her delight, it didn’t bother just her.</p>
<p>While her tribe was somewhat ambivalent if not confused about taking Human women to have sex with, the reaction of Garen’s tribe had been far stronger. They were <em>upset</em> about it, and Rags heard through the grapevine of Goblin rumors that a group of Hobs and warriors had gone to Garen to complain. Apparently, their tribe took pride in not ‘sinking to that level’, and they wanted Garen to stop it.</p>
<p>Perhaps he could have, but Garen was disinclined to go against Tremborag on this, especially because Rags knew some of the Human women had gone to the Great Goblin. So the message had come back to his tribe from Garen:</p>
<p><em>Deal with it.</em></p>
<p>The next night Rags didn’t eat with the main host of Goblins. Instead, she waited until later. The Redfang Goblins had been given the important duty of guarding the mountain due to their combat prowess, but that meant they ate and slept at different times.</p>
<p>They were not happy that night and ate in sullen silence, or started fights among each other. Rags didn’t say much—she just ate with some Hobs and elite warriors who stared at her silently. She knew they were wondering why she was here, but she didn’t do anything else. She just ate until one of them poked her softly in the side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Redfang would not listen.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>She looked at the one who’d spoken, a Goblin with a scar across his face.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>He bared his teeth angrily and struck the table. The Hob sitting next to the warrior stared at Rags. He was a powerful warrior; they all were. Garen’s tribe might not have been individually as mighty as he was, not close, but they were elites among Goblins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is not right.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another Goblin said that. Rags nodded her head fractionally, and knew they were looking at her, gauging her reaction. But then the Hob who stared at Rags spoke.</p>
<p>“Gold Stone Chieftain. He goes to visit Humans often.”</p>
<p>She paused. Rags’ mind went blank. Often? Did that mean—had the Gold Stone Chieftain known about the Human women before now? They hadn’t all been captured in the town. More were there from other villages, caravans raided, travelers abducted.</p>
<p>Often?</p>
<p>She stared at the Redfang warrior, and didn’t know what to say in reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the fourth day, Rags decided to join one of the raiding parties. Like the Goblin Lord—like any large tribe, really, Tremborag’s tribe had to constantly scavenge and hunt for new food or risk starvation, especially with so many mouths to feed. Rags knew the Goblins grew mushrooms and harvested the native rat, bat, and bug populations, but that was hardly enough.</p>
<p>These raiding groups had the hardest jobs of any of the Goblins in Tremborag’s tribe. They had to abandon the safety of the mountain to go out and hunt monsters, animals, or raid Human settlements. It was…well, frankly, it was being a Goblin and Rags relished it.</p>
<p>She fell in with one of the lesser factions in the mountain. Curiously, it was a group of mostly female Goblins. They resented being seen as mates by every male Goblin who came along, and they were of the opinion they fought just as well as male warriors.</p>
<p>They did. If not with as much strength, then with a good deal of savage cunning. Rags participated in an attack on a Human village—no capturing women, just taking animals and food while the Goblins scared away the Humans. She had a chance to talk with one of their leaders, a Goblin who used two daggers dipped in a concoction made from poisonous plants.</p>
<p>“Faction is weak.”</p>
<p>The other Goblin looked at Rags angrily, but relented when she saw Rags was just stating the truth.</p>
<p>“Weak, but we are united.”</p>
<p>“Other Goblins do not treat females well?”</p>
<p>“Not as warriors.”</p>
<p>The female Goblin bared her teeth.</p>
<p>“We are strong as males. When we fight, we prove we are equal.”</p>
<p>Rags frowned. She didn’t think that was true. It seemed like this band of female warriors was being exploited by Tremborag and the other goblins to do dirty work with no real reward.</p>
<p>She said so. The female Goblin nearly drew a blade on Rags, but Rags had demonstrated that she knew how to fight, and so it didn’t come to that. The female Goblin wiped her daggers clean as she spoke harshly.</p>
<p>“Someday, many Hobs like us. Many.”</p>
<p>They wanted to become Hobs. Rags understood that. Being a Hob was power in itself, and if they had many in their faction they would be respected. But until then, they would live on scraps and fight the hardest battles. Rags shook her head.</p>
<p>Interestingly, she saw that the old Goblin was part of this band of female warriors. Rather, it was more like they tolerated him and gave him their protection. He actually fought, with a rusty greatsword that looked like it was more rust than sword. Rags wondered if he could keep up with the younger warriors.</p>
<p>But he had a lot of fighting prowess to make up for being older. Rags had seen him step on a Human’s foot, shove him down, and then kick the Human unconscious without lifting his weapon. She supposed with age came experience. He grinned at her a few times as they returned to the mountain. She just stared at him and wondered what she was doing wrong.</p>
<p>She had to gain influence. Power. Rags became obsessed with it. On the night of the fourth day she paced back and forth in her room, wondering how to get a lead on all the other Goblins. Because, obviously she could do it.</p>
<p>She was smart, cunning, and Rags knew she was twice as competent as any of the other Hobs with their own faction. In a few weeks—a month perhaps—she would be able to amass as much power as the rest. And then…</p>
<p>It was all about finding the right allies. Rags had already decided who to approach first. So she summoned the Gold Stone Chieftain to her room after they had eaten dinner.</p>
<p>“Redfang Hob. One with mace.”</p>
<p>He nodded as Rags spoke to him in the privacy of her room. That was one of the most influential Hobs in Garen’s tribe, by far the strongest. The Gold Stone Chieftain stared at Rags impassively. She looked at him and remembered he visited the Human women. Often.</p>
<p>“Go. Be…nice to him. Gain trust.”</p>
<p>She would gain his trust and then take Garen’s tribe from him. Then she would attack more villages, gain more victories using only their force. With that influence she could—</p>
<p>“No, Chieftain.”</p>
<p>Rags halted, mid-thought. She turned and stared at the Gold Stone Chieftain.</p>
<p>“<em>What?</em>”</p>
<p>“No, Chieftain.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>She demanded it of him. The Gold Stone Chieftain pondered and then replied, looking at the ceiling.</p>
<p>“Not Goblin.”</p>
<p>That was an insult, one of the worst among Goblin kind. Rags recoiled and then became outraged.</p>
<p>“Obey! I am Chieftain!”</p>
<p>“Not if this is order.”</p>
<p>The Gold Stone Chieftain stared back at Rags, quietly defiant. It was too much. She could not lose him, her one supporter. Rags grabbed for her crossbow in fury.</p>
<p>“If you challenge—”</p>
<p>He moved <em>fast</em>. Rags had only been meaning to threaten, but the Gold Stone Chieftain moved towards her before she could raise the crossbow. She pulled the trigger and the crossbow bolt loosed—and missed. It shattered, against the stone next to his feet. The Gold Stone Chieftain grabbed the crossbow and tore it away from Rags, hurling it onto her bed.</p>
<p>Her sword. Rags had it but then it too was pulled away. The Gold Stone Chieftain hurled it aside and Rags stumbled back, suddenly afraid.</p>
<p>He loomed over her, huge. Rags suddenly realized how fragile she was, how weak. Without her weapons she was practically helpless. Her [Firefly] spell would only enrage him.</p>
<p><em>He visited Human women often.</em></p>
<p>But the Gold Stone Chieftain did not reach for her. Instead, he took one look at Rags and sat back down on the floor. He popped some rat jerky into his mouth and began to eat.</p>
<p>Stunned, Rags stared at him. The Gold Stone Chieftain spoke slowly to her.</p>
<p>“It is not Goblin. What you ask. Staying here is bad. If you stay, I will go. I will become Chieftain and leave. With my tribe.”</p>
<p>It was the most she’d ever heard him say. Rags stared at the Gold Stone Chieftain, stunned, and then absorbed what he’d said.</p>
<p>“<em>Leave?</em>”</p>
<p>He wanted her to leave? But this was the one place safe from the Goblin Lord! The Gold Stone Chieftain nodded, though.</p>
<p>“Bad place. Not Goblin. You said.”</p>
<p>He hurled the words back at Rags and she couldn’t respond to that. She could only come up with feeble excuses.</p>
<p>“Not strong enough. Need support. If wait…gain power. Influence—”</p>
<p>The words sounded hollow to her, weak. They didn’t sound like what a Goblin should say. She wasn’t speaking in Goblin. Rags met the Gold Stone Chieftain’s eyes and looked away, ashamed.</p>
<p>He stared down at her, disapprovingly. It didn’t look much different from his normal blank expression. But Rags realized—it was on purpose.</p>
<p>And slowly, sitting in that room, unable to meet the gaze of one of her subordinates, Rags understood. She put together the old Goblin, the Gold Stone Chieftain’s knowledge of this place, and everything else together in a sudden conclusion.</p>
<p>“You. Lived here, in past?”</p>
<p>She stared at him. The Gold Stone Chieftain nodded. Sighed.</p>
<p>“Once. Long ago.”</p>
<p><em>That</em> was why he could speak the common language! But why had he left? And why did he want to leave now?</p>
<p>Rags could understand. She could understand the way this place made you do un-Goblin things and fight amongst yourselves, and how it took away tribes and the meaning of loyalty to the Chieftain. But was that enough to risk death fighting the Goblin Lord?</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>It was all she asked. And the Gold Stone Chieftain stared at Rags, weighing, judging. And then he stood up.</p>
<p>Follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a dark place where the Goblins held the Human women. A dark place, a former building in the Dwarven city. Dark.</p>
<p>And made darker by the crying. Rags thought there would be screams, but too many were broken by this place. She looked into rooms—for some reason the Goblins gave the Humans rooms, as if privacy mattered. She could hear well enough.</p>
<p>There were over two hundred women there. A large number. But for thousands, tens of thousands of Goblins—</p>
<p>Too many. And part of Rags stared at what went on here, at Goblins biting, grabbing, forcing—part of her tried to forget as she saw.</p>
<p>But she focused on one thing. She focused on the Gold Stone Chieftain. Because he visited the Human women often. He took one into a closed room with him, she flinching, afraid. Him impassive as always.</p>
<p>And so. This is what Rags saw. She saw the Gold Stone Chieftain let go of the Human woman. He walked over to one wall and sat down. And he pulled a carrot out and began to eat it.</p>
<p>He sat with his back to one wall. Just sat. The Gold Stone Chieftain chewed slowly as the Human woman stared at him. She stood far across the room, shaking. Then—slowly—she realized he was not going to do anything. While he sat here, she was safe.</p>
<p>Standing at the door, Rags saw how the woman lost her fear. She screamed at the Goblin, let out the rage and hurt. Then she retreated to a corner, wept. He sat and ate.</p>
<p>Visited often. He had fought for the privilege to be here, Rags had heard. Smashed another Hob into a wall. He had known this place existed because he had been here once.</p>
<p>And he had left.</p>
<p>Sitting with the Human woman weeping in the background, the Gold Stone Chieftain looked up at Rags.</p>
<p>“Too weak, Chieftain. Too weak. Too small. Still too small.”</p>
<p>He nodded to her once. Rags stared at him, and then the woman.</p>
<p>Then she went outside. Rags stared around. Her ears were keen and she heard every sound that went on in this place. Heard the begging, the cries—</p>
<p>And she wondered what she would have done if one of the captured women or girls was Erin. What if it was her?</p>
<p>And once that thought was had, Rags couldn’t unthink it. She stared at a girl who stumbled back into her cell and saw Erin’s face on hers. Rags turned away.</p>
<p>She covered her ears. She tried not to imagine how many women would have come here over the years, how long they would have lived. Rags told herself Humans did it to each other. She told herself that Goblins did it to survive, that it wasn’t different than killing Humans.</p>
<p>But they all looked like Erin to her. The young, the old—they all had the girl’s face. They were all—</p>
<p>She ran.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Factions. Infighting. Power struggles and politics, all hidden in the depths of this mountain. A place where Goblins were safe from all but each other. That was what Rags had found here.</p>
<p>But it was not her place. This was not a world meant for her. It was wrong. And she feared she was losing herself the longer she stayed here.</p>
<p>So Rags sat in her room and thought. She was a genius. She knew it, in the same way she knew the sun was hot and the snow was cold. There were things only she could do, only she could think of and dare to achieve.</p>
<p>So Rags thought about what she could do if she could not stay here. She thought, and the answer seemed so obvious. How had she missed it before? She had been trapped, that was why. If not physically, then in her mind. It had taken the Gold Stone Chieftain, taken memory and guilt and seeing this place for what it was to break its hold on her.</p>
<p>There was only one course. Only one thing to do. So when the Gold Stone Chieftain had finished sitting and eating, she summoned him back to her room.</p>
<p>It was late. In a few hours it would be dawn. Perhaps now was not the time—but Rags knew it had to be now. She told the Gold Stone Chieftain what she wanted and saw him smile. Just once, but she knew she was right.</p>
<p>“Can you—”</p>
<p>Rags paused. That was not what a Chieftain should say. She looked at the Gold Stone Chieftain and thought of the risks. That was her job. So when she looked him in the eye, Rags was certain.</p>
<p>“Do it.”</p>
<p>He nodded and smiled again, briefly. Rags let him go to find all the Hobs he knew that would listen to him, and walked out into the mountain.</p>
<p>She kicked awake Goblins she knew, and had some of them find the Goblin with no ears. Then she found the female Goblin and her band and kicked them too. Some she sent to find the Gold Stone Chieftain. The others she told to go eat with the Redfang Warriors who were having what was lunch for them in a smaller mess hall.</p>
<p>When she was done, she found the Gold Stone Chieftain again. She looked at him as he pulled out an onion and bit into it. The smell made her eyes water, but she was surprised when he broke some off and offered it to her.</p>
<p>“Ready?”</p>
<p>She asked him quietly as she chewed. He nodded. Grunted.</p>
<p>“Four Hobs. Not many.”</p>
<p>“And the other?”</p>
<p>“More Goblins. But all busy. Very easy. I can do myself.”</p>
<p>If he said so, she believed him. There was nothing more to do before the moment, then. Rags stared at him and asked a question that she’d always wanted to know.</p>
<p>“Why name tribe Gold Stone?”</p>
<p>He shrugged, still chewing.</p>
<p>“I like gold. Gold that is not gold. I like it too.”</p>
<p>Rags knew what he was talking about. There were pretty stones that looked like gold you could find in caves with other minerals. It was valuable to Goblins, not just because it sparkled, but because it was a good alternative to flint and steel.</p>
<p>She looked at him, a silent giant. A Hobgoblin, a Chieftain who said little and sometimes did little, or so it seemed. But one with depth. One with a heart, who looked at what was and decided that it was wrong. Someone who wanted to be stronger but could do nothing.</p>
<p>“Why not you? Why not you…Chieftain?”</p>
<p>He looked at her, calmly.</p>
<p>“Not smart. Strong, but not smart. A good Chieftain is smart. Strong is easier, but not all are strong. Smart knows that. I am not smart.”</p>
<p>“You are.”</p>
<p>“Not enough. And cannot be Lord. Do not want to be. Like Tremborag. Too small.”</p>
<p>With that, he answered all of her questions and went back to eating. Rags stood beside him and then turned with a sudden impulse.</p>
<p>“Pyrite. I name you Pyrite.”</p>
<p>He stopped chewing and looked at her. Rags stared back. Pyrite was the name of such stones. It was a Human name.</p>
<p>“Not Shaman.”</p>
<p>“Do you care?”</p>
<p>She challenged him. The Hobgoblin thought about that for a second. And then he laughed. Pyrite smiled at Rags and nodded to her.</p>
<p>“See you later, Chieftain. Do not die.”</p>
<p>“I will meet you outside. You do not die. Chieftain’s orders.”</p>
<p>She left him behind. Rags made one trip to her room. She slung the black crossbow on her back, took her sword and shield, the buckler badly dented, but still hers. She had been given it by Erin. A Human.</p>
<p>And when Rags left her room, she was smiling. Because at last, she knew exactly what to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Redfang warriors were disgruntled by the sudden influx of Goblins during their lunch shift. But they grumbled only a bit; they were more sullen than anything else. And they recognized a good deal of the Goblins who’d entered. They were part of the Flooded Water tribe and some of the other tribes the Redfang warriors had journeyed north with, so they were allies in a sense.</p>
<p>Still, the Redfang warriors were angry. Some of the Hobs in here were Tremborag’s warriors and they longed to pick a fight with them. But they couldn’t. They felt muzzled here, like the Carn Wolves who they had to tether in pens in the city and not allow to roam free. Their mounts howled in distress and the Redfang warriors were angry.</p>
<p>And then the double doors leading in to the mess hall opened and a Goblin strode in, wearing leather armor. The Redfang tribe recognized her at once. She was Rags, and she…had…been their Chieftain. Not anymore, somehow.</p>
<p>But she was dressed for war. And it made all the Goblins who saw her sit up. Was something wrong?</p>
<p>Rags strode into the center of the room. Slowly, the eating around her stopped. She gazed around the room and saw Tremborag’s Goblins, some of them. The ones she thought might respect her. She saw the Redfang tribe, sullen, angry, but wondering. She saw the Goblin with no ears sitting next to a group of Goblins who glowed with bits of magic. And the female unit of Goblins and the grinning old Goblin still eating happily in the silence.</p>
<p>The small Chieftain of the Flooded Water Tribe took a deep breath and then shouted. Not in the common language, but in the tongue that was hers. Goblin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I am Rags! Chieftain!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every Goblin paused when they heard this. They stared at Rags, thousands of eyes watching her. She stood proud. She stood taller than she ever had walking this place. As if she was ten feet tall. So she looked down at the other Goblins as she spoke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I am Goblin. This place is not. If you are Goblin, follow me!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a declaration of war. Rags heard the susurration go through the assembled Goblins as the damning accusation left her tongue. It could not be unsaid. Even now she knew the Gold Stone Chieftain was attacking, cutting down Goblins of Tremborag’s tribe with the others she had sent him.</p>
<p>It was war.</p>
<p>“Traitor!”</p>
<p>A Goblin, one of Tremborag’s, shouted that. He leapt to his feet, drawing his sword. But a bolt of lightning caught the Hob as he leapt for Rags. He fell, and Noears grinned as the Goblins seated around him drew their weapons.</p>
<p>And then the hall erupted into violence. Rags lifted her sword and fought. If she died here, she would die as she had lived.</p>
<p>A true Goblin.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The mountain was silent when Garen found Tremborag. The Hobgoblin had to pass by patrols of warriors who moved in grim silence, weapons drawn and ready for a fight. But their attentiveness was in vain.</p>
<p>The battle was long over. It had been over before Garen had been awoken, and what he was seeing now was the aftermath.</p>
<p>Surprisingly few Goblin bodies lay in his path. Garen noted a few cut down here and there, usually in clumps—the losers of the rapid pitched battles in the night—but not many. True, some were being hauled away to be used as food even now, but it had been bloodless for what had occurred.</p>
<p>Rebellion. Or perhaps it was a choice, paid for in blood. When Garen saw Tremborag’s face, he knew what the Great Goblin of the North would have called it.</p>
<p>Tremborag stood in front of two double doors, staring into a room Garen recognized. The armory. Approaching carefully, Garen saw the four Hobs at the doors were all dead. Two had been felled by blows with amazing strength. He suspected an axe. The other two were cut to death, probably from multiple blades all at once.</p>
<p>“They took everything of value.”</p>
<p>That was what Tremborag said when Garen joined him. The Hobgoblin stared into the empty armory and nodded.</p>
<p>It was empty.</p>
<p>Oh, a few of the racks still held arms in them, but they weren’t magical, only steel. Everything else had been looted, stripped away by the Goblins who’d fled the mountain.</p>
<p>Rags’ tribe. And not just her tribe—</p>
<p>“How many?”</p>
<p>Tremborag shrugged, face blank as he stared into the armory. He kept looking at the empty racks, and Garen wondered how powerful some of the enchanted blades had been. Probably very.</p>
<p>“Two thousand. Four thousand? Six thousand? I did not count the non-warriors. But her tribe followed her, and much of yours, Redfang. And she took several hundred of my warriors and some of my Hobs with her.”</p>
<p>“Mm. Bad.”</p>
<p>Garen was no linguist, even though he spoke the common language. He saw Tremborag turn towards him.</p>
<p>“Is that all you have to say?”</p>
<p>The Hob nodded towards the armory.</p>
<p>“Took weapons. Anything else?”</p>
<p>“Food. Supplies. Most of your wolves—the ones who belonged to the warriors who left—and the women.”</p>
<p>That made Garen smile. Tremborag stared at him.</p>
<p>“You think it is funny? They are all <em>gone</em>, Redfang. One of the Hobs—one of the ones <em>you</em> brought here—killed all the Goblins there and let the women free.”</p>
<p>Garen Redfang just shrugged.</p>
<p>“Human females are not important. Less important than the arms.”</p>
<p>“Oh, but they’ve taken arms! And killed my Goblins! They have <em>rebelled</em> against me, Garen Redfang! For that they will die.”</p>
<p>Garen held back from pointing out that only a few had rebelled against Tremborag. Most had just followed Rags as she was their Chieftain. But Tremborag was looking back into his precious armory. His body was quivering with rage, and Garen watched with interest the way it made his fat wobble.</p>
<p>“Tell me, Redfang—”</p>
<p>And here Tremborag turned. Garen tensed as he saw the depths of fury that spilled from the Goblin’s crimson eyes. The Great Goblin seemed to grow larger in front of Garen. No—not seemed—his appearance took on the other form Rags had seen in the Human town. He stared down at Garen.</p>
<p>“Tell me. Give me one reason why I should not kill you now. You brought that little Goblin here, that <em>Rags.</em> Why shouldn’t I kill you since she has taken more than you have given me?”</p>
<p>It was a question that would lead to one of the two’s deaths if answered incorrectly. Garen grinned fiercely, grasping tightly the hilt of his sword.</p>
<p>“If you could. I have my fang.”</p>
<p>“Your magic sword does not scare me. Without your wolf to ride, you are slow. And your warriors have left you. Why should I not <em>kill</em> you?”</p>
<p>“Because I have the key. And I know where the other is.”</p>
<p>Tremborag paused. He stared down at Garen and the two locked eyes. Then Tremborag stood on his two feet, fat, angry, no longer the being he had been before. Garen was disappointed to see that, but it was better than dying.</p>
<p>“You knew? Then why have you waited, Redfang? Tell me, and I will take it, no matter if it lies in the heart of Invrisil, behind one of the Walled Cities, or at the bottom of the sea.”</p>
<p>“It is in a worse place than that.”</p>
<p>Garen told Tremborag where the key was. He saw the Great Chieftain sigh.</p>
<p>“That <em>is</em> worse. Far worse. But I will take it all the same. As soon as I hunt down the small Goblin and eat her alive.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a threat. It was a quiet promise, and Garen knew that Tremborag meant every word. He said nothing. But he hoped that wherever Rags was, she was running far and fast. She could still be useful.</p>
<p>But what a waste. That was what Garen thought, and it was why he remained in the mountain. One kind of Goblin had left, the other stayed. Which group was right? Who was truly Goblin?</p>
<p>There was no one to care. The Goblins lived and died. The other races paid little attention to them, save for when the Goblins became a threat. No one remembered who the Goblins had once been.</p>
<p>Not even them. But some dreamed. Some looked back as the past called to them. But only the Kings knew the truth of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Death. Death and blood and sometimes fire. It was what followed her wherever she went. Rags accepted that fact. It was her nature, the nature of Goblins. She led the Goblins following her through the mountain, fighting any groups of warriors they came across. But the Goblins of Tremborag’s tribe were lazy, secure in this place. The alarm hadn’t even begun to spread as she met with Pyrite and the Goblins she’d sent to them.</em></p>
<p><em>Some carried magical weapons. Others, bundles of supplies. But the largest group was leading hundreds of Human women, most naked or wearing practically nothing. Rags shouted at Pyrite to find clothes </em>now—<em>not for decency’s sake but because it was cold outside. </em></p>
<p><em>She began ordering the Goblins around her, taking command and organizing her Goblins, fighting for each second so they could flee before Tremborag’s forces awoke and overwhelmed them. Then they were running, dashing out into the snow as the Redfang warriors whooped and shouted, and their wolves howled, breaking a path through the snow—</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>When Rags woke up, her tribe was still on the move. This did not surprise her.</p>
<p>Goblins were perhaps unique among all the races of the world in that when they wanted to move, they could cover distances most armies could only dream of. Every Goblin learned to run away quick, and even if they weren’t as fast as a horse or Human in the short term, they easily outdistanced everything in the long term.</p>
<p>How it worked was like this: if a tribe had a wagon and animals to ride or pull it, some would sleep on such vehicles, waking up to give other Goblins a turn. The animals had to rest occasionally of course; when they did they were normally eaten if the Goblins were in a real hurry. Otherwise, other Goblins would just push the wagons, sometimes with the horses crammed on top of it.</p>
<p>On foot it was different. Goblins would just collapse where they were and sleep, before waking and running to rejoin the tribe. That way they slowed their pursuers by offering free targets and a snack if the pursuers were monsters or other Goblins. Either way, the tribe would keep moving. They could cook, eat, pee, and do whatever they needed to do while marching.</p>
<p>And it worked well when it came to outrunning pursuers. So well that as Rags sat up in the crowded wagon, digging herself out from a pile of Goblin bodies, she saw the mountain was a good distance behind them.</p>
<p>How long had she slept? Probably at least six hours, Rags guessed. One of the benefits of being a Chieftain was that no one poked you awake and made you keep walking. It didn’t stop other Goblins from lying on top of you and farting in your face, but no Chieftain could prevent that.</p>
<p>Stretching on top of the piled up Goblins, Rags yawned and ignored the grumbling under her. Someone tried to shove her leg off their face—she stomped and then climbed off the wagon.</p>
<p>The instant her feet touched snow, Rags realized it had snowed <em>again.</em> How annoying! But when she looked up she had to smile. Because it was a wonderful day.</p>
<p>The sky was very blue. Rags stared up into the winter morning, breathing in and smiling faintly as the sun rose overhead, warming her from head to toe. It felt like it had been a very long season, full of cold and wet. But in a month or two it would be the shortest day of winter. And then the frost would end.</p>
<p>And a good thing too, because Rags had a tribe to lead. An even bigger one than before. Rags stared around. Goblins shambled past her, moving quick but all clearly on autopilot. She remembered what it was like, and considerately didn’t disturb them except to get pointed towards food.</p>
<p>The Goblin approach to ingenuity was always effective, if not entirely sane. That was how Rags found a cooking pot bouncing along on top of a wagon, over a burning pile of wood <em>on top of the wagon. </em>In fairness, the Goblins hadn’t set the actual wagon on fire, preferring to spread a layer of dirt to build a cooking fire on top of, but every now and then they had to put out fires caused by errant sparks.</p>
<p>All that meant was that Rags got a hot bowl of porridge seasoned with cinnamon, butter, and sugar of all things. She frowned, but ate three bowls greedily as befitted any Chieftain. Apparently, her Goblins had seized a lot of strange foods from Tremborag’s stores in their mad bid to escape the mountain.</p>
<p>Sugar was a delicacy. One Rags had only really tried at Erin’s inn. But it was also fairly useless to keep since it wasn’t filling like grain or meat. Thus, Rags wholeheartedly approved of using it now.</p>
<p>Belly full, Rags turned to the next important thing on her agenda: finding out where the heck they were. She walked towards the head of the tribe of sleepy Goblins and soon found the Hob who’d taken charge while she was asleep.</p>
<p>Pyrite looked pretty much like he always did, albeit wounded. Several deep slashes had cut into his flesh—two around his belly, one on his arm. But none were too bad, and his fat had shielded his internal organs from harm. Even so, Rags resolved to find Pyrite a healing potion once they had sorted out their supplies. She’d always had an emergency stash in her old tribe’s setup.</p>
<p>“Trouble?”</p>
<p>She asked Pyrite as she fell into step behind him. The Hob glanced at her and shook his head. He wasn’t eating anything for once. Rather, he had a stick in his mouth. He was chewing on that and spitting out pieces of wood now and then. Rags supposed he liked to feel like he was eating even when he wasn’t.</p>
<p>“No one follows yet.”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>They still spoke in the common tongue. It was just…easier. Some ideas were expressible in that language whereas the Goblin’s tongue always felt like it had holes in its vocabulary. But even in this language, body language, facial expressions, and context made up a lot of the conversation.</p>
<p>Rags turned to stare at the winding trail of Goblins following in their wake.</p>
<p>“Spread out.”</p>
<p>The Gold Stone Ch—Pyrite just shrugged. He took the stick out of his mouth and pointed with it to each side. Rags saw riders on the infamous rust-red wolves pacing alongside the Goblins. Scouts. She nodded, feeling reassured.</p>
<p>“Humans?”</p>
<p>That was the next issue on her mind. Rags assumed they were around somewhere. Again Pyrite pointed and she saw they were marching separately from the Goblins. She frowned; most were riding in wagons pulled by the animals the Goblins had liberated.</p>
<p>“Slow.”</p>
<p>They were keeping pace, but what she meant was that they were taking away resources her tribe could use. It was a criticism as well, but Pyrite just shrugged.</p>
<p>“Cannot survive alone. Must take. Too hurt to move, many.”</p>
<p>Rags glanced again at the Human women. She couldn’t see much, bundled up as they were with whatever the Goblins had managed to take but—she believed him. She scowled, but made no further objections. She glanced at Pyrite. There was a lot she could have said. Thank you, for one thing. But Goblins didn’t really do that. So she just nodded at him.</p>
<p>“Tired?”</p>
<p>He shrugged.</p>
<p>“Walking.”</p>
<p>She nodded. Hobs were tough, and he was fairly tough even for a Hob. She could respect that.</p>
<p>“You keep walking. I…think.”</p>
<p>He smiled, once.</p>
<p>“Yes, Chieftain.”</p>
<p>Rags grinned as he put the stick back in his mouth. He always knew what to say, even if it was nothing. She walked next to Pyrite, the two moving in silence. It was easy. Rags just let her feet take her forwards while her mind wandered.</p>
<p>What did she have to do now? Well, she’d established that there was no immediate danger, so she had to start planning for the non-immediate danger. That meant Tremborag’s fury, the issue of them being exposed and in the wilderness where they might run into Humans, monsters, or something else, finding a new food source, a base, managing her new Goblin recruits, figuring out what to do with her tribe next…</p>
<p>Ah, it was good to be a Chieftain again! Rags smiled, even as she thought of all the things she had to do. It was hard work, yes, but she was certain that she could handle it. And if she couldn’t, probably no other Goblin could. She was Chieftain, and part of being Chieftain was believing you were the best.</p>
<p>By her calculations, they had only one or two more hours at most before Tremborag’s forces would be in hot pursuit of them, if they weren’t already. The Great Chieftain might have a vast following, but it was slow to mobilize for the same reason. Getting together enough supplies and warriors would be tough, and they wouldn’t be much faster than her tribe.</p>
<p>Then again, they didn’t have to be. They would easily be able to follow Rags’ tribe from the wake they’d left in the snow, and Goblin warriors could march longer than normal Goblins. It would come down to a battle sooner or later, and she had to find the best place for it.</p>
<p>Or did she? Rags frowned. What she really needed was a place to rest her tribe. Just for a little while. Her Goblins were used to rough travel, but the Human women were not. Plus, some of her warriors were injured and had to be exhausted after last night.</p>
<p>Last night. Rags remembered it clearly. She’d walked into the hall, afraid she’d be cut to pieces, that no one would follow her. She’d raised her sword and called for Goblins to follow her—</p>
<p>And they had. Oh, they had. Some had fought, but the majority had seen what Rags had. They had made a choice and chosen to be a tribe that lived and died free. They had chosen a Chieftain, rather than a faction under a Goblin who didn’t care for their lives.</p>
<p>They had fought.</p>
<p>And they had won. From the mess hall, Rags had taken her Goblins, now a sizeable force and rampaged through the unguarded halls of Tremborag’s mountain. That late at night they had been able to overwhelm what few soldiers were up. And such was the clamor of a Goblin mountain that the fighting hadn’t actually woken that many. They’d grabbed food, tools, even fought their way to the place where the animals had been kept.</p>
<p>It had been a nightmare trying to get the Redfang warriors to control their wolves and prevent them from going on a rampage or eating the other animals. For that matter, trying to get a horse in the presence of wolves to behave was a bad idea. But Rags had done it. And then she’d linked up with Pyrite, who’d met her with hundreds of Human women and the loot from Tremborag’s armory.</p>
<p>Rags had planned the entire thing. If she was going to break away from Tremborag, then she was going to do it in the most Goblin style possible. And that meant a raid. She’d sent Pyrite many of the warriors she was sure of, to help him free the captives and take weapons out of the armory. That was a prize too good to pass up.</p>
<p>Then they’d fled. They’d run into the snow, the mountain only now coming alive behind them. Some Goblins had tried to pursue them, but the Redfang warriors had covered their retreat. Out in the open they were ideally suited to engaging the enemy and retreating to join the others.</p>
<p>A victory. It was a great one, and now Rags just had to make it stick. And to that end…</p>
<p>She glanced at Pyrite. He was nearly down to the end of his stick. She watched, wondering what he would do when he’d chewed it to bits. Sure enough, the Hob spat the pieces into the snow as he passed. Then he reached into a bag at his side…</p>
<p>And pulled out another stick to chew. Rags gave up. She poked him and he looked down.</p>
<p>“Chieftain?”</p>
<p>“Who is…local? Who lives here?”</p>
<p>The language Humans and other species used was so much more precise, even if it wasn’t theirs. Pyrite considered this and found a Goblin to poke. That Goblin wandered off and poked some other Goblins who all did the same…in a few minutes Rags had a Hob and two yawning Goblins in front of her.</p>
<p>She recognized them. One was the Goblin with no ears. Another was the leader of the female Goblin raiding party who’d joined Rags. And the last was the old Hobgoblin who grinned at Rags and the others, looking not the least bothered by their forced march.</p>
<p>“Chieftain.”</p>
<p>The old Goblin said it first, bowing his head deeply to Rags. She saw Noears hesitate, then nod deferentially to her. The female Goblin hesitated, then copied Noears.</p>
<p>“Stop that. No bow.”</p>
<p>She pointed to the old Goblin. She was not Tremborag, to demand such things. But a nod was appropriate. He straightened and grinned at her.</p>
<p>“Where place to rest?”</p>
<p>She looked at the three. The female Goblin was first to answer. She knew the landscape and told Rags of a nearby place that might be good. Rags nodded. She called out to Pyrite. He listened to the female Goblin’s directions, found a messenger to poke, and in minutes the entire Goblin convoy was changing course.</p>
<p>It was easy. One Goblin poked another, both Goblins poked another, and so on and so forth. Within twelve pokes you generally had all the tribe’s attention. And the Goblins at the front were the only ones who had to know which way to go, so if you had a halfway intelligent Hob up there, things ran smoothly.</p>
<p>Only the Human women failed to get the message. Some of them who were awake looked alarmed as the Goblins seemed to turn right as one. They stopped in their wagons, some pulling at the horse’s reins to wake the others up. That was pointless in Rags’ opinion, but then she saw some of the ones who looked like warriors were holding weapons under their blankets and clothing.</p>
<p>She frowned. Humans could be a problem. But to her surprise she saw Pyrite stump over to the Humans in the snow. They let him approach—some of the women clearly recognized him and others knew he’d freed them. It took Pyrite a few minutes, but the Humans followed the Goblins quickly enough when they realized what was going on.</p>
<p>And where had the Goblins gone? Their destination was already in sight, albeit camouflaged against the horizon. They were walking towards a hill.</p>
<p>The hill was just a hill. It was a nice workout for the legs to climb to the top, and it afforded a good view of the surrounding landscape, but that was all. The Goblins being Goblins, declined to bother to summit the hill and instead camped in the lee of it, sheltered from the wind. Rags still made a few Goblins go to the top to keep a lookout, but she was more interested in just letting everyone get a few hour’s rest while she planned things out.</p>
<p>She had to figure out a way to deal with Tremborag’s forces. This wasn’t a good place for a stand, but Rags still wondered if she <em>had</em> to fight. She might lose a pitched battle even with the new weapons from his armory—especially since she had no idea how any of the magical ones worked. Obviously you could just use one as a weapon, but what if its magical effect was emitting an aura of flame, or creating some kind of special effect? One wrong swing and you’d fry your side.</p>
<p>How could she get rid of Tremborag’s retaliation force? Rags went through all the Goblin fallbacks. Fighting was no good, she couldn’t outrun them, she doubted she could hide their tracks or her tribe…bribing wasn’t going to work. Surrender meant death. But what if she—</p>
<p>“Chieftain.”</p>
<p>Rags looked up with a scowl as she sat in a patch of cleared dirt. Who was bothering her? She saw six Goblins waiting for her and immediately sat straighter.</p>
<p>These weren’t any ordinary Goblins. If the tribe Rags had led out of the mountain had factions—and if it did she’d get rid of them soon enough—these were it. More accurately, they were the factions from the mountain.</p>
<p>Six Goblins. Rags saw Pyrite, looking impassive as ever, Noears, the female Goblin leader, and the old Goblin. But two other Goblins had joined them.</p>
<p>One was a Hob that Rags recognized. He was – had been one of Tremborag’s warriors who sat at the high table. He was a good warrior as far as she knew, but not outstanding. He was at the bottom of the rung since he didn’t have a huge faction behind him, and she suspected he had joined her simply because he didn’t want to have to fight for influence with the others Hobs. He probably represented the Hobs who’d lived in the mountain.</p>
<p>The other warrior was a normal-sized Goblin with a scar over his face. He was one of the elite Redfang warriors and Rags had already privately dubbed him Redscar. Of all the Goblins present, she was only really concerned about his faction. The others were smaller or behind her all the way like Pyrite. But the Redfang warriors were an independent lot and she didn’t know if they trusted her or she could trust them.</p>
<p>Rags stood. The Goblins waited for her to speak. She nodded, and then spoke in their tongue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I am Chieftain.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It needed to be said. The other Goblins nodded, the mountain Hob and Redscar slowest of the lot. Rags noted this, and went on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This tribe is Goblin.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Another easy statement, and all the nods were quick this time. This tribe was Goblin. They’d fought for it. Only Rags’ leadership was disputed. She thought about this, and then pointed in a random direction.</p>
<p>“If you not like…go over there.”</p>
<p>All the Goblins turned and looked. Rags shook her head.</p>
<p>“Not there. Go away.”</p>
<p>It was an unusual statement. Normally Goblins didn’t abandon their tribes no matter what. If they had an issue they challenged the Chieftain or left with as many Goblins as they could gather to form a new tribe. However, since this was in itself a challenge the breakaway Goblins usually had to fight to leave their tribe. But Rags was telling the others to just go if they had their differences.</p>
<p>All the Goblins present considered this. Rags looked from face to face, frowning when she saw the old Goblin. Why was he even here? But maybe Pyrite had brought him. He seemed to know the old one. And after meeting Noears, Rags realized some Goblins were hiding their true natures.</p>
<p>Noears. There was another thing to think about. Rags knew nothing about him other than that he could cast powerful spells and he had once been targeted by Tremborag. Was he loyal?</p>
<p>Time would tell. Rags pointed to Pyrite.</p>
<p>“He is big Hob. He tell my orders.”</p>
<p>Pyrite looked vaguely surprised, but the other Goblins looked willing to accept this, even Redscar. Every Chieftain needed a few Hobs who were competent enough to follow orders. Pyrite was the best choice.</p>
<p>That done, Rags waited for the other Goblins to speak. Something had brought them here. At last, the mountain Hob spoke.</p>
<p>“Chieftain. Will we fight Tremborag’s forces?”</p>
<p>He had the same clear diction of the other Goblins from Tremborag’s tribe. It was too Human-sounding for Rags’ taste. She scowled.</p>
<p>“Hope not.”</p>
<p>“Chieftain. Where are we going?”</p>
<p>“Away.”</p>
<p>“What will we be doing?”</p>
<p>“Goblin thing.”</p>
<p>This answer clearly didn’t please the Goblins who’d lived in Tremborag’s tribe. But what did he expect? Pyrite just smiled and the old Goblin cackled. Even Redscar grinned.</p>
<p>“This is how Goblins act. She is true Goblin, Goblin Chieftain Rags!”</p>
<p>The old Goblin slapped the younger Hob on the back. He turned and glared, but Rags just nodded.</p>
<p>“I am Chieftain. I decide. You go. I think!”</p>
<p>This was how Goblins worked. The Chieftain made decisions—sometimes at random, and the tribe adapted. Some Chieftains were better than others—Rags knew Garen was famous for his split-second decisions which forced his Hobs to scramble to keep up. But she would have a plan. A good one.</p>
<p>If only she could figure out what it was.</p>
<p>While she waited for one to appear, Rags took a circuit of the camp. The stolen weapons were piled in a wagon, not touched by any Goblins yet although she saw some warriors eying them. But they were smart enough to realize that they would probably get weapons in the end and that stealing them would earn a thumping from one of the Hobs who had an eye on the wagon.</p>
<p>Next? Cooking. Rags found a brunch being cooked up from one of the horses who’d broken an ankle in the snow. She regretted losing such a valuable animal, but it did taste good.</p>
<p>And last? Rags went to see the Human women.</p>
<p>They’d entrenched themselves a ways away from the Goblins. They were a bit pathetic, in Rags’ opinion. They huddled together, sitting at one of the fires that the Goblins had had to build for them. And they didn’t want any Goblins coming near them, especially not any males. The only ones who could approach were female Goblins with food…or Pyrite.</p>
<p>Rags approached them now. She saw one of them—a Human adventurer by the looks of her—holding her sword, but she didn’t flinch. She walked up to her, as she seemed to be the one in charge.</p>
<p>She was battered. She must have been captured in the attack on the town. Rags had no idea if the woman was a Gold-rank adventurer, but she’d been attacked by the Goblin warriors who’d hit her repeatedly. She was still recovering, although Rags thought some Hob might have given her a potion for her injuries.</p>
<p>The woman stared at her warily with the rest of the women. Rags stopped in front of the adventurer and held out her bare hands. The woman saw Rags was unarmed and released the grip on her sword hilt.</p>
<p>“Mm. Understand me?”</p>
<p>All the Humans jumped. Rags rolled her eyes. How could they not know Goblins could speak? The adventurer stared at her.</p>
<p>“I…do. Who are you?”</p>
<p>Her voice was hoarse and she had to cough as she spoke. Rags pointed at her chest.</p>
<p>“Chieftain.”</p>
<p>Another incredulous look. They stared at Rags, and then at Pyrite, sitting and eating fried horse meat by a fire. The Goblin sighed again. Humans. Did they think biggest was always best?</p>
<p>She gestured to the camp, speaking slowly so they could understand.</p>
<p>“Not harm. No harm. Follow. Eat. Live.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>The adventurer stared at Rags, wanting to hope, but not quite daring to. Rags smiled. She tapped her chest.</p>
<p>“I am Goblin. True Goblin.”</p>
<p>They stared at her as if they didn’t understand, but Rags was used to that. She’d dealt with Erin more than enough times. She stood up and left. So long as they didn’t cause trouble, that was fine.</p>
<p>Human women. After meeting them Rags was decided. She had to ditch them as soon as possible. She was aware of what they’d gone through and even sympathetic—saving them had been the right move. But they were slow, suspicious, and they ate food Rags’ tribe would need. In short, they were fairly useless to Goblins.</p>
<p>But they would be useful because they were Humans. And Rags’ tribe hadn’t harmed them. In fact, they’d rescued them. The beginnings of an idea stole into the young Goblin’s mind and she smiled.</p>
<p>It was time for a daring plan. She went to Pyrite. He was sleeping. So Rags found Noears instead. He was busy eating and chattering to another Goblin with a band of feathers tied to a staff. Another magic-user? Rags would investigate later. She pointed at Noears.</p>
<p>“Where Human cities?”</p>
<p>He stood up and showed her. It turned out that Noears had taken a detour from the others when fleeing the mountain. He hadn’t gone for supplies or anything else—instead, he’d gone to the war room where the Goblins planned their attacks and stolen all the maps. Rags cackled with glee as he spread them out on a wagon.</p>
<p>“Here, here, and here, Chieftain.”</p>
<p>The map was the first real picture Rags had ever seen of the continent. She stared avidly at it, noting how the Human cities were all dispersed a good distance away from each other—except in the north, where they were quite clustered in some places. There were far less cities the closer they came to the High Passes, indicative no doubt of how far the Humans had settled.</p>
<p>There were several cities close to them. Rags looked at Noears. He was watching her intently, gauging her, she guessed.</p>
<p>“Most dangerous?”</p>
<p>He thought and pointed. Rags looked at the cities nearest to their position, shaking her head at some, nodding at others.</p>
<p>“What kind of death?”</p>
<p>That was a very Goblin question. Noears answered it in a very Human way.</p>
<p>“[Knights] and [Riders], Chieftain. Very fast. They run down Goblins with lances. Strong mages, but not many leave walls. Cities have armies. Riding patrols are common.”</p>
<p>Rags frowned. That was a lot more than she’d grown accustomed to around Liscor. Patrols were regularly sent from the city, but only to weed out monsters. They didn’t have mobile forces.</p>
<p>Still, if her idea worked they wouldn’t need to fight any Humans. And if they did…Rags patted at her pouch. She still had the gem of [Terror]. She hadn’t had much call to use it against Goblins—it was ineffective—but it could give the Humans a good scare.</p>
<p>“Good. We move soon! Go tell others!”</p>
<p>She gave Noears the task of poking the others awake and getting the tribe moving. It was time to put her idea into action. They headed straight for the nearest Human city, a few hour’s march away. It was going to be a dangerous plan, but almost all Goblin plans were dangerous.</p>
<p>Behind her, a vast army of Goblins was no doubt on its way to kill Rags and her tribe. Well, so what? She sneered at Tremborag’s might. He could kill Gold-rank adventurers in seconds…which was really scary and impressive. But she didn’t need lots of muscles. She was going to beat all his elite warriors with her head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Human city was named Merendia, or perhaps Balum. Or was it Ostegrast? Rags didn’t know, and she was annoyed by the way the other Goblins from Tremborag’s tribe argued about it. Who cared what it was called? It was a Human city. That was all the context you needed.</p>
<p>And it had a lot of Humans in it. And high walls. And as Rags stared up at it, she couldn’t help but notice all the Humans with bows who shouted and raised the alarm as they saw the Goblin tribe appearing out of the plains and marching towards them.</p>
<p>They thought it was an attack. And even as Rags watched, a mounted force rode out of the gates. Men and women in armor, armed with the long lances she’d heard of but never seen in person. A mobile force, quite unlike the forces Drakes employed. They didn’t get along as well with horses.</p>
<p>It was a formidable force, even without the adventurers Rags spotted on the walls, practically aglow with magic. More than one Goblin in Rags’ tribe gulped, especially the ones who weren’t actually warriors. But Rags ordered them to move forwards without fear.</p>
<p>In the ordinary way of things Rags guessed the Humans would have let them approach while they blasted them with spells and rained arrows on their heads. The cavalry would hit the tribe from the flanks and the adventurers would kill scores of Goblins and all the Hobs themselves.</p>
<p>It would be a massacre. If Rags were stupid enough to attack the city. Which she wasn’t.</p>
<p>She laughed with delight as the Humans stared at her tribe crossing the main road leading out of the city. Why did the Goblin army cross the road? Quite literally to get to the other side. But why hadn’t they done that away from the city? Already the Humans were reconsidering their approach. The mounted force was circling Rags’ tribe at a distance. They weren’t about to let this many Goblins get away where they could attack smaller villages or settlements.</p>
<p>A [Mage] on the walls was getting ready for a big spell, Rags could tell. She tensed, wondering if the Humans hadn’t seen yet. She didn’t want her tribe to lose any Goblins today—</p>
<p>A cry went up from the mounted force as they circled Rags’ marching Goblins. A cluster of them raced towards the town, their riders standing up in their stirrups and shouting at the Humans on the walls. In Rags’ vision the [Mage] stopped casting the spell and she sighed in relief.</p>
<p>Why did the Humans not attack this tribe? The answer was simple. From their perspective, the Goblins had hostages.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Human women, no doubt captives of the Goblins, made to do unspeakable things. That was broadly true, and Rags did consider the Humans as valuable shields. But not a shield in the sense of having hostages.</p>
<p>The Humans had stirred when seeing the city. They’d begun to look hopeful, but as they’d seen the army pouring out of the gates, they’d begun staring at the Goblins, wondering if they were going to be held captive. Rags saw the female adventurer leading them looking at the Goblins and at the cavalry, clearly wondering if she and her friends could make a break for it.</p>
<p>That was why Rags had positioned her tribe so they were in front of the Humans in the city. She rode towards the women on her Carn Wolf as they halted in place. They stared at her in fear and the adventurer gripped her sword.</p>
<p>“Goblin. We wish to go to that city. Do you understand? If you let us go, we will promise not to attack your tribe.”</p>
<p>The woman called out to Rags, looking from her to the walls again. Rags stared down at her, and then nodded genially.</p>
<p>“Good. Do.”</p>
<p>The adventurer’s head turned back towards Rags and her face went slack as if she couldn’t quite believe what she’d heard. She clearly hadn’t expected Rags to agree that easily. She looked at Rags.</p>
<p>“Do you want…money? Food? A ransom?”</p>
<p>“No. Go. But off wagons.”</p>
<p>Rags had no intention of letting the Human women keep the horses or the wagons. She made gentle shooing gestures even as the adventurer stared at her.</p>
<p>“Go, go. No need for Humans. Too slow. Eat too much. Also ugly. Go, go.”</p>
<p>Half the women stirred at that, but Rags just kept waving her hands, repeating her gestures. The adventurer stared at Rags, but after a moment she seemed to realize that the Goblin was being genuine, even if the reasons escaped her.</p>
<p>What must the Humans on the walls of the city think, to see the Human captives dismounting and slowly forming a group which marched towards them, away from the evil Goblin tribe? Rags had no idea. But she had her tribe march double-time, crossing the road and moving further into the wilderness.</p>
<p>It was purely a diversionary tactic. Distracted by the Humans, the city was only too willing to avoid a fight. As soon as a good bit of distance had been put between the tribe and the women, the cavalry immediately closed in. They formed a wall between the tribe and the captives, which handily let Rags’ tribe go on its merry way. The Humans on the walls were shouting, rushing about, no doubt preparing to receive these women.</p>
<p>But another cry went up when they saw the lone Goblin turn from the already distant tribe of Goblins and ride towards the women. Humans gripped their bows, but they didn’t fire. Because, of course, this was one lone Goblin, hardly a threat even if she was riding a Carn Wolf. And the Humans were gripped by a trait of their species, which was curiosity.</p>
<p>Rags rode back towards the Human women, ignoring the mounted warriors who spread out, encircling her. They might have tried to pull her off her mount—in which case Rags had the gem of [Terror] clutched in one sweaty hand ready to use—but the adventurer called out and stopped them.</p>
<p>“See? Humans go.”</p>
<p>That was what the Goblin said as she pulled her Carn Wolf to a stop a few paces away from the Human woman. The wolf <em>huffed</em> and sniffed at the adventurer, but she looked up at Rags without fear.</p>
<p>“You let us go. And the other Goblin—he liberated us in that mountain. Why?”</p>
<p>“True Goblins.”</p>
<p>Rags said it again and this time the adventurer seemed to understand. She hesitated, and then bowed her head.</p>
<p>“We owe you a debt. But you are Goblins…”</p>
<p>In short, still scum to be exterminated from the face of the earth. Rags nodded, still genial. Then she pointed at the Human adventurer, at her bruised face.</p>
<p>“Bad Goblin did this. Bad Goblin.”</p>
<p>The woman stiffened. Then she nodded. Hatred burned in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Yes. He lives in the mountain. I will remember his face.”</p>
<p>Rags pointed the way they’d come.</p>
<p>“Mountain Goblins. Yes. Big tribe. Big leader. Great Chieftain. Tremborag.”</p>
<p>The woman started.</p>
<p>“<em>Tremborag?</em> A Goblin with a name?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Rags nodded energetically. She waved her arms to show the other Humans—warrior types who’d drawn closer out of curiosity and their squad’s leader, who looked fiercely interested in what she was saying.</p>
<p>“Tremborag. Very scary. Strong. Fought in Goblin war. With Goblin King.”</p>
<p>A susurration went through the Humans. Rags liked that word. Susurration. It was a word that meant gasping and muttering and meaningful looks to one another. The adventurer looked pale.</p>
<p>“Thank you for telling me this. He will be…we will do what is necessary.”</p>
<p>They’d make a big army and attack him. But Rags wasn’t done. She pointed in the direction of the mountain, visible in the distance.</p>
<p>“Mountain. Great Chieftain.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>The woman frowned, clearly wondering why Rags was repeating herself. Rags grinned and pointed south.</p>
<p>“Goblin Lord.”</p>
<p>Another gasp, but this time there was less surprise. Rags saw the Human woman frowning, and then reaching a conclusion.</p>
<p>“They’re…going to join forces?”</p>
<p>Close enough. The look on the other Human’s faces was priceless. Rags nodded, pretending to look concerned. Then she waved at Human.</p>
<p>“Goodbye.”</p>
<p>“What? Oh—you’re going?”</p>
<p>Rags nodded. She eyed the riders. They clearly weren’t sure if they should let her go. Honor was one thing, but she was a Goblin after all. The adventurer looked from Rags to the mounted warriors and called out.</p>
<p>“Please, let her go. She rescued us. I don’t think she’s…hostile.”</p>
<p>“But Miss—”</p>
<p>“You heard her. I’ll make an exception. I take full responsibility for this decision. Part ranks!”</p>
<p>Their leader called out. The riders moved aside and Rags nodded to the adventurer. The woman stared at Rags, searching her eyes.</p>
<p>“Before you go—who are you? Do you have a name?”</p>
<p>Rags paused. She turned as she guided her Carn Wolf around and grinned at the woman. She pointed at herself.</p>
<p>“Rags. Chieftain of the Flooded Waters tribe.”</p>
<p>Then she kicked her wolf and after he glared at her, he shot away. She left the city behind as the gates opened and the Humans rushed out, demanding to know what had happened. Much was happening back there, much drama and crying and confused explanations no doubt. But that was the Human’s problem. Rags had done what she came for.</p>
<p>She caught up to her tribe a few miles past the city. They were still marching, headed towards a forest on the map. It looked like it had a lake nearby, which would be good for water and fish. There might be monsters, but it was a good place to set up for a few days.</p>
<p>And they had a few days! Rags rode her wolf through the ranks of Goblins. As she did, a huge cheer went up that made the wolf snort in surprise. But the Goblins understood.</p>
<p>Rags had done it! Without a single shot loosed, without a single Goblin dead, she’d managed to lose whatever force Tremborag had sent after them. Tremborag’s Goblins might be fierce, but even they’d hesitate to go right past a city. A battle would be inevitable, and even if they overcame the city’s walls and defenders—and they might—it would be costly and attract too much attention from the Humans.</p>
<p>For that matter, now that Rags had let the Human women go, there would be serious repercussion for Tremborag anyways. His mountain was exposed; the Humans had seen the inside, seen how many Goblins there were. And if they thought he was going to help the Goblin Lord—a Great Chieftain of the Goblins who’d fought with the Goblin King? What could be more dangerous? They’d send out a force to attack him right away.</p>
<p>He’d probably survive. But in the meantime Rags would be free. So she sat on her wolf’s back and laughed and laughed in the cold air. If there was anything Goblins liked to do, it was gloat since they seldom had a chance to try it.</p>
<p>“Time to make tribe better.”</p>
<p>That was what she said to Pyrite as she rode up beside him and hopped off to walk. Her crotch and butt hurt when she rode the wolf for too long. He nodded at her, smiling faintly as he crunched on something. Rags stared at him.</p>
<p>“Rocks?”</p>
<p>Pyrite spat the bits of stone out and shrugged.</p>
<p>“Tastes like rock.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Keeps teeth sharp.”</p>
<p>That was true enough. And it wasn’t like he was in danger of losing any; Goblin teeth fell out and regrew anyways. Rags shrugged.</p>
<p>“Forest. We organize properly.”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>“And get healing potion. For you.”</p>
<p>He shrugged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a reason why Rags was a Chieftain so young. There was a reason why even Garen Redfang needed her. True, part of that reason was very confusing and involved a girl named Erin Solstice, but mostly it was due to Rags being smart.</p>
<p>Everyone knew this was true. Rags was a genius. If they knew the word for prodigy, the Goblins might have referred to her as one. But they didn’t, so she was just smart.</p>
<p>Very smart, as it turned out. As soon as the Flooded Waters tribe arrived at their destination, Rags began organizing the tribe, much to the surprise of Tremborag’s former Goblins.</p>
<p>Normally a tribe just let any Goblin do what needed doing. Hobs rounded up Goblins who were close to them for tasks, without any particular rhyme or reason unless the Goblin was known to be good at that particular task. But Rags disapproved of such inefficiencies. She craved order, so she created it.</p>
<p>Division of labor. Rags already had the practice of dividing Goblins by skills, but now she formed multiple groups that would work in the day and night. Like the warriors. They were by nature fairly lazy when not fighting in order to conserve strength, but Rags put them on rotating patrols, day and night shifts, and assigned them to groups she could call upon on demand.</p>
<p>It was very complicated, but only for the one in charge. The individual Goblins only had to look up to one particular leader and hang out with one group, so it was simple and easy for them. Rags immediately set about fortifying this location, spreading out her camp so that the warriors had places around the outside while the largest camp was in the inside. She ordered the Redfang warriors to scout the area while she had another group of Goblins check out the lake.</p>
<p>When the warriors reported that the most dangerous creatures living nearby was a few Mothbears, quite able to kill any other intruders into their domain, Rags sent a group of warriors to hunt the bears while she sent foraging teams in every direction. While she did that, she pondered what to do with the mages.</p>
<p>There were four of them, including Noears. They weren’t really warriors in the sense that Rags wanted them on patrol, but they had useful abilities. Some could start fires. Noears was good at shooting lightning, but all the [Mages] wanted was to practice magic and eat. Rags eventually decided to attach them to warrior groups, which went over pretty well.</p>
<p>The Redfang warriors were delighted to have something to fight. They came back with only a few wounds and six Mothbears ready to be skinned and eaten. Rags had already decided they were going to be a core of her fighting force…</p>
<p>If she could figure out what that fighting force would be.</p>
<p>Here was the problem. Rags sat in the middle of her camp where all her Goblins were busily cooking, eating, sleeping, or doing all the important tasks she’d set them to. The only issue was that there wasn’t actually that much to do. She hadn’t sent out raiding parties and cooking and scavenging only took a small part of the tribe.</p>
<p>The rest needed direction, and Rags needed better warriors. She knew it. She’d left Tremborag’s mountain with essentially her same tribe plus Garen’s warriors. Well, they were certainly stronger for the inclusion of all the Redfang warriors, but the rest of her forces were just…Goblins. That was to say, they could probably overwhelm a small village, but without the Redfang warriors they had all the fighting ability of a squishy sponge.</p>
<p>And that was bad, especially up north. Rags had already seen that Gold-rank adventurers were far more common here, and the Human forces were nasty and well-armed and trained. She needed to give her Goblins an edge.</p>
<p>Thus, her dilemma. What Rags had were a lot of resources, a lot of Goblins, and a lot of enemies. All of that theoretically translated into a strong tribe to fight said enemies, but Rags had to work out how to get to that point.</p>
<p>What could she give her warriors? Rags already had some warriors testing out the weapons they’d stolen from Tremborag, which mainly involved one Goblin hitting things while the other Goblins stood far away and ducked whenever something happened. But magical arms did not make instant warriors, Rags knew.</p>
<p>Something else. What did Rags have? Well…she had crossbows.</p>
<p>Rags stared around at her Goblins. Many of them still had the crossbows she’d constructed with the goods taken from the Human city. Yes, that was a good thing.</p>
<p>She’d come up with the stone crossbow to provide her Goblins with an easy weapon to use both for hunting and fighting. It was the perfect tool for a weak Goblin tribe with limited resources, and she still kept the crossbows around for her foragers.</p>
<p>But what Rags needed were good weapons now, something to add to the regular force of Goblins. She could…build more crossbows?</p>
<p>They certainly had the parts. Right now they had around a hundred crossbows, but Rags grew excited as she thought about what would happen if they had five hundred, or a thousand. She didn’t need to give them to her warriors either—the best idea would be to give them to all her Goblins who didn’t normally fight! Crossbows were easy to use and aim. Why, she could have a thousand bolts raining down on her enemies before the battle had even begun!</p>
<p>The idea burned bright in Rags’ mind. She immediately ordered Goblins to start chopping down the tall fir and pine trees of the forest so she could make more crossbows. They’d have to get a lot of metal parts and things like screws of course, but she had a lot of tools already. Rags went to Pyrite excitedly and told him her idea.</p>
<p>He was sitting with Redscar and the old Goblin, overseeing the work while they ate from a small pot. Rags stared into it. It looked like they’d found a few squirrels. She took a bowl and chattered to them, explaining what she wanted.</p>
<p>Redscar looked intrigued by the possibilities, but the old Goblin—Rags was going to call him Whitebeard since that was what he had—scratched his chin, looking amused. And Pyrite just frowned.</p>
<p>“Arrows.”</p>
<p>That was all he said. But it immediately shattered Rags’ grand plans.</p>
<p>Arrows. Or more accurately, bolts. Crossbows used a different sort of ammunition than regular bows, that was fair enough. But making said ammunition wasn’t exactly easy, especially since you needed a good fletcher and glue.</p>
<p>Rags knew her Goblins could make a lot of bolts, especially with all these trees around. But they’d be wooden ones, not as powerful and would probably break after the first shot. Plus, what about fletching? A couple of thousand of birds didn’t just sit around waiting for you to pluck them. And there was the issue of glue…</p>
<p>And the bigger issue, the one that made Rags grind her teeth as she bit into the hot meat in her stew, was carrying all the ammunition everywhere. It would be cumbersome, and they’d run out fast if they had to keep resupplying a thousand crossbows at once.</p>
<p>A few hundred? Very doable. Smart. But a thousand? It might work for a Human army, but Goblins didn’t have an industry capable of supporting them. Rags scowled at Pyrite, but knew he was right.</p>
<p>“Less crossbows.”</p>
<p>But enough to pound her enemy. Rags wanted at least a few hundred Goblins capable of firing into her enemies in every battle. Pyrite nodded, but Redscar looked up.</p>
<p>“Chieftain. Need better warriors.”</p>
<p>He was stating the obvious. Rags scowled at him. But Redscar just jerked a thumb back towards the city they’d passed, far away.</p>
<p>“Strong Humans. Cavalry is…”</p>
<p>He hesitated. Rags saw he didn’t want to say they were as good as or better than the Redfang warriors. She stared at Whitebeard. Perhaps Greybeard was a better name.</p>
<p>“Cavalry. Better than wolves?”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Greybeard smacked his lips appreciatively as Pyrite filled his bowl with more squirrel stew. He looked thoughtfully at Redscar and Rags as he chewed.</p>
<p>“Dangerous, Chieftain. Very. Wolves is good for surprise and raiding. Horses is good for charging. Hard to stop.”</p>
<p>Pyrite nodded at that. Redscar looked upset, but he had to agree.</p>
<p>“Have to have way to stop if fight, Chieftain.”</p>
<p>That was all he said, and thrust the <em>how</em> onto Rags. She scowled. She had no idea how these mounted warriors fought, that was the problem! She was too young, too inexperienced for all her intelligence.</p>
<p>Then Greybeard looked up from his bowl and stared at Rags.</p>
<p>“Can remember, Chieftain.”</p>
<p>She paused and all the Goblins looked at him. Greybeard poked a nail into one ear, looking casual.</p>
<p>“Is big tribe. Probably can remember.”</p>
<p>That was right! Rags could use the memory of Chieftains! She was surprised she hadn’t thought about it herself—and slightly surprised Greybeard knew about the Chieftain memories. Then again, he was old.</p>
<p>That night, Rags lay on her back around snoring Goblins and closed her eyes. She had found something for the Goblins to do after all—she’d had them begin felling trees. It was tough work, especially since the trees were hard. But the magical axes were wonderful in that regard. Many were enchanted not to break or to be resistant to damage, and so they made wonderful tools for her woodcutters.</p>
<p>Rags had the idea they could build a fortress here, or maybe a village. It was just an idea, but more wood never hurt to have, especially since she was going to have her Goblins build some more crossbows anyways.</p>
<p>But the memory. Rags frowned as she concentrated. She knew how to recall the past, although sometimes it came to her unbidden. All she had to do was go <em>back—</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>He was a warrior, a Hob Chieftain of the Biting Blade Tribe, one of the strongest tribes of the northern plains. He stood on the open battlefield, roaring as his tribe clashed with the force of Humans. They were strong. All the Humans in the north were strong. They had come to his tribe, his lands to take it from the Goblins who lived here. Some tribes had fled, the cowards. But so long as he lived, he would resist them.</em></p>
<p><em>A flash of light off of metal caught the Goblin’s attention. He turned and saw the [Knight] riding towards him.</em></p>
<p><em>Yaltes Byres. One of the great [Knights] who had slain countless Goblins. He wore silver armor, just like the rest of his famed house did. The Hob Chieftain bared his teeth. He had a big hide shield in one hand and javelins in the other. Even as the [Knight] charged him, the Hob cast his first javelin.</em></p>
<p><em>It was a powerful throw, one boosted by his Skills. It could kill even a normal Hob at range and pierce armor. But the [Knight] avoided the throw, urging his horse to gallop left. A miss. The Chieftain roared and threw another javelin.</em></p>
<p><em>This time the [Knight] took the impact with his shield. It was heavy—the Hob saw the mount falter briefly. But Yaltes came on. He was a worthy foe.</em></p>
<p><em>This was it. No time to throw again. The Chieftain briefly regretted not hitting the mount. But the [Knight] was so agile! His riding Skills let him dodge around a group of Goblins who came to protect their Chieftain, and mounted as he was, he was out of reach for all but Hobs. And his warhorse was armored as well.</em></p>
<p><em>Damn him. There was more to a warrior than just the quality of their armor. The Chieftain raised his javelin, roaring as he charged. He just had to take the first charge. He could see the silver lance pointed at his heart. He raised his shield—</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Rags sat up the next day, heart pounding, listening to the birds singing in the trees. They stopped singing fast as Goblins shot at them and claimed the eggs out of their nests. She rubbed at her eyes and cursed in Goblin.</p>
<p>She hated to remember her ancestors dying. It didn’t hurt, but it was scary. And real.</p>
<p>So, even a Hob Chieftain had fallen to a mounted warrior? Rags was under no illusions as to why he’d lost. Regardless of level or equipment, the truth was that the lance was a deadly weapon. She saw that now.</p>
<p>All that reach! On horseback it was capable of hitting anything with so much force that Rags doubted even Garen was capable of blocking it. Your only option was to dodge or take the rider out first. But if they had armor that was hard. And what if you were fighting in a huge group? Then you were a pretty stationary target, ready to be run through.</p>
<p>No wonder Redscar had been so concerned. Rags immediately got to work thinking of countermeasures as her tribe woke up and got back to work scavenging, cutting down trees, and in the warrior’s case, training.</p>
<p>Rags watched with interest as the Redfang warriors sparred and did odd things like exercise before they ate. No wonder they were different from regular Goblins.</p>
<p>She should probably train too—it had been a while since Rags had trained with Garen. But later. She found Redscar and got him and a few other Redfang warriors—and Pyrite, the female Goblin and Greybeard—together for a thinking session.</p>
<p>Their conclusions were fairly simple. The time-honored way to stop a horseman was with a long, pointy stick, preferably in great numbers. Pikemen were a common sight in armies, and if you backed that up with a shield wall you could counter a lot of things.</p>
<p>Rags was only too willing to get her Goblins to start fashioning long, wooden pikes out of the trees they’d felled, but she had a feeling she was making some sort of mistake. Yes, pikes were good and useful and they’d stop a charge. But the easy counter to that was to shoot the pike holders, blast them with magic, or just sent a bunch of infantry at the pikes and shields and break them up so you could ride them down.</p>
<p>That might not be a problem if Rags had a Human army—she’d just make sure they were the best around and wouldn’t break no matter what you sent at them, and would keep a group of archers in reserve. But she didn’t have Humans. She had Goblins. And they couldn’t deal with a face-to-face pitched battle with Humans on foot.</p>
<p>There had to be a better way. Rags supervised her Goblins with carpentry Skills cutting the trees into pikes. She scowled when the best [Woodworkers] among them started competing with the one [Carpenter] to see who could make the longest pikes.</p>
<p>Twenty-foot long pikes? Rags kicked the Goblin who smugly showed it to her. No Goblin could carry that! She doubted most Humans would be able to use it effectively!</p>
<p>But then Rags paused and reconsidered. No lance was going to beat a pike that long. And if two Goblins carried it…</p>
<p>It still didn’t help with the issue of the pikes being stationary and weak to ranged attacks. Plus, the gloomy Rags saw that a group of ten pikes all lined up was great and pointy—but only in one direction. She sighed. It took three or two Goblins to lift each pike, too.</p>
<p>They were giggling and nudging each other as they held the pikes in place. They weren’t warriors. Rags snapped at them and pointed. She told them to put the pikes with the other weapons. The Goblins grumbled, but swung the pikes up and then let them fall in the right direction. Then began running with them held horizontally—probably because that was a lot easier than holding them straight up and catching them on the branches of the few trees that still stood.</p>
<p>And they nearly killed a score of Goblins on the way. Rags watched all the Goblins in her camp shouting in panic as a—a wall of pointy death came straight at them. The Goblins holding the pikes laughed merrily, running full-tilt as Goblins dove out of the way. Everyone was shouting at the Goblins to stop, but no one could quite manage it. A Hob found himself in the path of the pikes and even he was forced to dive aside or risk being skewered.</p>
<p>And Rags stared at the Goblins causing havoc until Noears walked over and tripped them all up. In the ensuing confusion—where the offending Goblins were beat up by everyone they’d scared—Rags had another great thought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later that day, the Redfang warriors were intrigued and amused to be ordered to spar against a force of regular Goblins in a mock battle. Their new Chieftain, Rags, had apparently come up with a new weapon or formation she wanted to try against them.</p>
<p>A group of sixty elites lined up, laughing and joking. They held blunted practice weapons—bundles of sticks or crude swords made of wood—while another group mounted Carn Wolves.</p>
<p>It would be a slaughter, no matter what Rags had done. They had many levels and Skills on the other warriors, and even if they had real weapons, the Redfang Warriors would beat them into a pulp with sticks alone. Unless they were carrying the magical artifacts, that was. But that would be cheating.</p>
<p>To their amusement, the Redfang warriors saw Rags had created a traditional wall of pikes, about forty in a tight wall of Goblins. There were two Goblins or more to every pike out of necessity—they were so heavy only a Hob could lift them!</p>
<p>The Redfang warriors laughed hard. The pikes were dangerous, yes, but all they needed to do was fight past the tips of the pikes or flank them. If you got past the tip of the pike—which was dangerous, granted, a good [Pikeman] could run you through with one solid thrust—then you were fighting in close quarters and the pikes were useless.</p>
<p>Lazily, the Redfang warriors advanced while the mounted warriors sat back on their Carn Wolves. They had no desire to charge <em>that.</em></p>
<p>The Redfang warriors were still joking when they realized something was wrong. The pikes were moving. Towards them. And not just slow—the warriors blinked and then got worried when they saw the wall of pointy pikes was coming at them at a dead run.</p>
<p>The Goblins were <em>charging!</em> That wasn’t fair! And they were moving in pretty good formation—it was easy for Goblins to move together. The Redfang warriors faltered, and then moved quickly to the left.</p>
<p>The pikes swung left to target them. Now the Redfang warriors were getting really worried. They backed up, tried to form a shield wall. But just one look at the twenty foot long pikes rushing at them and they had a terrible premonition of how well that would work.</p>
<p>The Redfang warriors hesitated, turned. They tried to split up, but the pikes just split up to follow them. They were coming closer, closer—</p>
<p>The warriors broke and ran. The Goblins cheered as the other Goblins fled the prodding pikes, cursing. It was at this moment the mounted Redfang warriors, irate at their companions’ disgrace, leapt into action.</p>
<p>The Carn Wolves howled as they charged around the pikes, seeking their rear. Fast they might be, but these cocky Goblins wouldn’t laugh so hard when they got a few sets of teeth to their backs—</p>
<p>The pikes, which had been pointed in the opposite direction, rose up as the riding Redfang warriors watched. The two or three or four Goblins assigned to each pike hauled it up fast, and then lowered it towards the riders. The riders immediately pulled their mounts away—the wolves were already shying away from the new wall of points that had appeared in front of them.</p>
<p>The riders broke up, circled. But the pikes came up, and suddenly they had formed a square with pikes in every direction. And then one wall of pikes came at a rider, making him curse and the Carn Wolf run yelping—</p>
<p>Sitting on a felled stump, Rags grinned as she stared down at the mock battle. In the end, the Redfang warriors won. The pikes were susceptible to a charge from the side if the enemy surrounded them. But this was a new group, after all, barely trained. What if you had multiple groups of pikes, all ready to charge in any direction? You could turn them fast if you trained hard enough, Rags was sure.</p>
<p>She glanced over at Redscar and Pyrite. The Redfang warrior was clearly unhappy, but Pyrite was smiling slightly.</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>They turned to her. Redscar grumbled.</p>
<p>“Weak to arrows. And magic.”</p>
<p>Pyrite nodded. But he looked at the Goblins. They weren’t hardened warriors like the Redfang warriors. They weren’t even proper warriors, most of them. They were just Goblins. They ran as one and moved together because that was natural to them as breathing. He looked at Rags and she knew he was seeing what she was seeing.</p>
<p>“Lots of pikes?”</p>
<p>She nodded at him. Rags stared around at the lovely forest she’d chosen to settle in. Tall trees created a canopy of pines, dusted with snow. It was a tranquil place, a place to rest and find oneself. A place where animals could live, where nature was peaceful.</p>
<p>A nice place. Rags eyed the trees and grinned at Pyrite.</p>
<p>“Get chopping.”</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Some days Erin woke up with a smile on her face. She yawned, sat up, and felt the quiet of the morning wash over her.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like how she lived back on Earth, back home. There Erin needed alarm clocks to get up, and the instant she was awake she had a phone to check, things to do. But in this world things weren’t as pressing. Or maybe it was just that Erin took the time to appreciate what she hadn’t before.</p>
<p>The cold of winter still had not let up and Erin shivered a bit as she threw off the thick wool blanket. It was scratchy, and there was no central heating in the inn. But she slept soundly each night, from being tired as much as anything else.</p>
<p>Yes, in some ways this world was better for her. In others—Erin touched her chest and remembered all she’d left behind.</p>
<p>Some days she would cry. Others she would laugh, or just try to forget. But Erin couldn’t forget what she’d lost. She still remembered a house in Michigan, her mother and father, neither of whom could play chess well.</p>
<p>Some days she imagined her mom would wake her up because Erin had slept in till eleven or twelve. She’d be upset because Erin missed the breakfast she’d made and tell Erin not to stay up looking at chess games online, especially because it was bad for her eyes. Then her father would grow serious and talk about how Erin was pursuing her passion and how they should support her—</p>
<p>Erin dressed and went downstairs, caught in the memory. She only came out of it when she found herself in the kitchen and realized she had to cook.</p>
<p>What to make today? Erin was used to cooking for many people by now and she moved on autopilot. Biscuits and gravy, yes, that would be good. She could make a thick sauce with the remains of the meat she’d used for last night’s dinner. Thick and full of energy from all the fat and stuff. That would be good. And eggs. Everyone always liked to eat good eggs.</p>
<p>That was how Erin spent around thirty minutes, cooking before everyone else woke up. She was brisk, efficient, and inhumanly quick in the kitchen now. Erin wondered if a professional chef would be able to make a meal faster than her.</p>
<p>“If I go back home, I’m definitely going on Iron Chef and kicking everyone’s butts.”</p>
<p>She smiled to herself as she looked at the large pot of meaty gravy and the biscuits she’d taken out of the stone oven. They were hot and steaming. She took a bowl out, filled it with gravy, and dipped the biscuit in it.</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>It was good. Erin ate it, and then another biscuit while she listened to people waking up above her head. Miss Agnes would be down soon, slightly annoying and cheerful as always. Erin…didn’t feel like dealing with her today.</p>
<p>She’d done what needed doing, anyways. The pot of gravy could serve a small army, which is pretty much what descended on the inn for breakfast most mornings anyways. And the biscuits were easy enough to make that even Miss Agnes had a hard time messing it up. Unless she let them burn in the oven, that was.</p>
<p>And if she did, too bad! Erin filled a basket with thirty of the biscuits she’d made and found a smaller pot and a lid for the gravy. As an afterthought she looked around for a drink as well, but there was nothing portable. She wasn’t about to carry a keg.</p>
<p>That was what this world lacked, Erin reflected. She left the inn and walked down the snowy cobblestones, out of the inn before anyone came in or went downstairs. It was still very early, so Erin made good time through Celum’s streets.</p>
<p>This world lacked…certain things. Good containers, for one thing. Oh, sure, you could transport in bulk pretty well with barrels and so on, and they were remarkably waterproof, but what about water bottles, or…or covered pitchers? Then again, who would need it that badly?</p>
<p>“Globalization? Or is it industrialization? Modernization? Convenience?”</p>
<p>Probably all of the above. When you had the time to think to yourself that a mid-sized container built specifically to hold liquids was a valuable time investment, you probably had too much time on your hands. But it was convenient.</p>
<p>Erin sighed, and took another bite of one of the biscuits. It tasted good. But—it was sort of flat.</p>
<p>“Needs baking powder.”</p>
<p>How could a world live without baking powder? Erin was sure there was a substitute the people of this world used, but she hadn’t found it yet. In the meantime, she had to live without vital necessities like cake. Or delicacies like cake. Or what Erin considered essential for mental health: cake.</p>
<p>It really was a shame. Erin sighed and watched her breath trail upwards, the vapor dissipating over her head. No cake. She could make cookies, though. But wait—didn’t that need baking soda or something?</p>
<p>“Drat.”</p>
<p>Erin glared at the ground, but without any real anger. She still felt pretty good.</p>
<p>Baking soda, baking powder. What was the difference between the two? One made things rise and the other…did the same thing. But there was a difference!</p>
<p>If only Ryoka was here. She might know how to make it. Then again, Ryoka had told Erin flat-out that she couldn’t replicate half of the things from their world for lack of funding, resources, or interest. Or all of the above. But baking soda was critical! If Erin could sell cookies she’d rule the world.</p>
<p>Who could help her in her quest to create more unhealthy things to eat? Erin passed by a few people walking down the street, smiling at them but saying nothing, and then turned down another street. She’d gone this way so many times she didn’t need to think about it.</p>
<p>Who made baking powder in her world? That was a really good question now that Erin thought about it. Baking powder…companies? But who invented baking powder to begin with?</p>
<p>“Chemists.”</p>
<p>Erin hazarded a guess. She knew it had some weird stuff in the powder, which is why she couldn’t just grind up a rock or something to make it. But if she needed this world’s equivalent of a chemist, then—</p>
<p>For a few seconds Erin blinked. Then she slapped herself lightly in the head and nearly dropped the basket of biscuits and pot full of hot gravy. She caught herself and kicked open the door of the shop she’d arrived at.</p>
<p>“<em>Octavia!</em>”</p>
<p>Some people were morning people. Other people were not. Erin saw a comatose form draped over one of the tables jerk at her loud voice. Octavia raised her head and glared at Erin.</p>
<p>“Go melt yourself.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be grumpy. Wake up! It’s morning. I’ve got food.”</p>
<p>Erin looked around. Octavia’s alchemy shop was the usual clutter of magical potions and mess it normally was. She went into the kitchen and came out with a mostly clean bowl. Carefully, she poured some gravy into it and put some biscuits on the table in front of Octavia.</p>
<p>“Do you have any water? I wanted to bring something to drink, but there was nothing I could take back at the inn.”</p>
<p>Octavia blinked slowly at the food in front of her, still not quite focusing on the world. She took a biscuit and stared at it as if it was foreign to her.</p>
<p>“Water? I’ve got some…I think. Do you need to drink it? What’s for breakfast?”</p>
<p>Erin took that as a sign she shouldn’t drink anything in Octavia’s shop at the moment. She pushed the bowl towards Octavia.</p>
<p>“Gravy and biscuits. Eat. Also, I’ve got a job for you.”</p>
<p><em>That</em> made Octavia sit up.</p>
<p>“Really? How much does it pay? Do you want potions or alchemical items? If you need to defer payment I can give you extremely reasonable—”</p>
<p>“Shut up and eat. I want baking powder. And soda. I’ll tell you what it is—you be quiet.”</p>
<p>Erin scowled at Octavia, but this too was part of her day. She was used to Octavia and she liked the other girl, although neither she nor Octavia would ever admit that out loud. Some people Erin just couldn’t quite gel with. Especially if they kept trying to sell her stuff like Octavia.</p>
<p>“Seems doable.”</p>
<p>That was what Octavia said as she finished the biscuits. She wiped her finger in the bowl of gravy and licked it—Erin winced a bit because Octavia hadn’t washed her hands. Then again, the [Alchemist] was scrupulously careful about washing ingredients that got on her hands off before she ate, so she was probably fine.</p>
<p>“I’ll take your offer up. Business is slow thanks to all those damn Goblins out and about and if you’re right about people buying this baking powder from me, I’ll gladly let you finance me.”</p>
<p>Erin rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“Good. I’ll give you two gold coins to start with. And why is business slow? Wouldn’t tons of people be buying your potions if they’re fighting Goblins?”</p>
<p>“Five. If they were fighting, I’d be selling everything on my shelves. But the cities are waiting, not sending out armies, Erin. Fighting Goblins is a lot easier when you’re on top of a wall and Esthelm falling scared everyone. Once this Goblin Lord’s main army and smaller ones are located, everyone will breathe easier. Until then…”</p>
<p>Erin nodded.</p>
<p>“Three gold coins. And eight silver ones. And no arguing!”</p>
<p>Octavia chewed on her lip, but nodded in the end.</p>
<p>“I can survive on that, I suppose. Barely. But I’ll need you to make dough for me and tell me if it’s rising right.”</p>
<p>“You’ll be able to tell. And making the dough is easy. I’ll teach you the recipe. Stop complaining—it’s just like alchemy!”</p>
<p>“Hah!”</p>
<p>In the end, Erin paid Octavia and felt good about it. She wandered over to one side of Octavia’s shop, where the usual clutter had been cleared aside and the potions on the wall had been stored somewhere else.</p>
<p>“Anyone come by last night? I mean, after I left?”</p>
<p>Octavia shook her head.</p>
<p>“Nope. And no one’s come by—not after I started charging people for lingering in the store.”</p>
<p>Erin smiled.</p>
<p>“Well, if anyone does come by—”</p>
<p>“I get to sell them stuff if they won’t wait for you in the Frenzied Hare. Got it.”</p>
<p>Octavia was already poring over her ingredients, searching for the things that might work as leavening agents. She barely turned, but she did glance out of the corner of her eye as Erin walked over to the innocuous wooden door that had been set into the wall.</p>
<p>It was just a door, and it couldn’t possibly lead anywhere given that behind it was solid stone. And yet—Erin swung the door open, and suddenly she was staring <em>up</em> into the sky. She blinked a few times and tried to get her brain to understand that she was looking up at the sky because the door this one was connected to was lying on the back of a wagon. Then she took a deep breath and stepped through and up and—</p>
<p>The door closed behind Erin. Octavia shook her head, blinking a few times to regain her own sense of balance. The [Alchemist] had a very strong stomach due to all the things she had to handle and smell. But that sight made her stomach lurch a bit. And yet, it was still incredible to her.</p>
<p>“What a door.”</p>
<p>That was all she said. Then Octavia got to work. And Erin travelled many miles to a bumpy wagon travelling down a snowy, empty road towards Liscor. And the best part was that she didn’t spill the gravy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some things in this world were slow and wonderful. But the fast, magical moments were just as great too. As Erin stepped through the magical doorway in Octavia’s shop, she stepped <em>upwards</em>, into the sky. That was disconcerting, but Erin knew what to expect and didn’t stumble as the world twisted around her and she was suddenly walking the right way onto the back of the wagon.</p>
<p>“Woog.”</p>
<p>It still made Erin want to puke a bit every time she did it. But the experience of it—walking through a portal made by magic—was still novel.</p>
<p>And it was so convenient. Erin looked around the wagon and saw several people who’d been huddled in their cloaks or with a blanket and pillow look up hopefully at her arrival. She smiled brightly and raised the pot and basket.</p>
<p>“Good morning! Anyone want breakfast?”</p>
<p>“Morning, Erin.”</p>
<p>“Food!”</p>
<p>“Good morning, Miss Solstice.”</p>
<p>“Food! Oh. Morning, Erin.”</p>
<p>Yvlon, Pisces, Ksmvr, and Ceria all sat up and smiled or stared at the food Erin had brought—or did both. Pisces and Ceria both seemed especially keen for breakfast, but Yvlon and Ksmvr both eagerly accepted the food Erin had brought. The adventurers who were now the new Horns of Hammerad clustered around the pot and began sharing out the biscuits.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Mister Termin! Would you like some biscuits and gravy? They’re hot—I just baked them!”</p>
<p>The wagon driver gave Erin a gap-toothed grin as he accepted some of the food she’d brought.</p>
<p>“Thank you kindly, Miss Solstice. This is the finest journey I’ve ever had, riding along with you serving such good food morning, noon, and night.”</p>
<p>“My pleasure. I’ll bring you all lunch too, if you’re not planning on stopping and eating at a village or something.”</p>
<p>“No fear of fhat.”</p>
<p>Pisces mumbled around a mouth full of food as he ate appreciatively. He gulped, and went on, ignoring the disgusted look Yvlon was giving him. Ceria was eating just as fast.</p>
<p>“Why should we stop? With a constant supply of food, we need not rest—”</p>
<p>“Except to give the horses a break.”</p>
<p>Yvlon leaned towards Ksmvr as Ceria tried to cram a biscuit covered in gravy into her mouth. The Antinium was the only person who ate with good manners on the wagon. Two hands delicately held a biscuit up for him to nibble while a third hand held the gravy pot out for the others to dip into.</p>
<p>“Don’t you worry about that, Miss Byres. My Skills will keep these two old plodders moving all day. A good night’s sleep and rubdown is all they need, don’t fret.”</p>
<p>Termin smiled as he pointed to the two older horses that were pulling the wagon this early in the morning. Erin eyed them as she found a place to sit with the other adventurers in the back. The horses, Erma and Fox, looked old, but they both had feedbags on and seemed happy enough to eat and walk along. Besides, the wagon wasn’t going <em>that</em> fast.</p>
<p>She smiled and sat with her friends. They ate and she leaned back. It was colder outside the city, where the wind could blow right at you. But the air felt fresher here, and the sun helped warm her through the layers of clothing she wore. There was no smell of poo that sometimes came with people living in a medieval city and using chamber pots. The scents of crowded living were gone, and there was just the empty smell of winter on the breeze.</p>
<p>It was a good day, and Erin was happy to be alive. She was in a good mood, although the Horns of Hammerad were decidedly less well-rested.</p>
<p>Ceria yawned as she finally stopped eating and stretched out. She rubbed at her back as Erin apologized for not bringing anything to drink.</p>
<p>“No worries. We can get water easily enough. We just need some mugs. I think we brought some with us…there they are. Now, some snow—”</p>
<p>“Allow me, Captain Ceria.”</p>
<p>“Oh, thanks, Ksmvr.”</p>
<p>The half-Elf let Ksmvr take the mugs, hop out of the wagon, and briskly fill them with freshly fallen snow. Erin watched appreciatively as Ceria handed Pisces half of the mugs. Both mages concentrated briefly, and in moments the snow was melting as they warmed the cups. Ceria handed the steaming mugs around and Erin passed one to Termin in the front.</p>
<p>“Careful, it’s hot.”</p>
<p>“Too hot. Springwalker, did you have to boil this water?”</p>
<p>“It beats drinking something nasty, Pisces. Warm isn’t good enough, even with fresh snow.”</p>
<p>Ceria bickered with Pisces as the two mages sipped from their drink. Erin declined her mug—she’d already drunk enough. She smiled again.</p>
<p>“That’s so cool you can do that. It’s so easy—what spell did you use?”</p>
<p>Pisces scratched one ear, looking pleased, haughty, and somewhat embarrassed for the genuine enthusiasm Erin had.</p>
<p>“No spell. It is hardly necessary—true, most magics require spells, but the most basic of cantrips require no spells to utilize. True, if we wanted to increase the heat emitted we would have to learn a spell, but any [Mage] with a basic understanding of the theorems of spellcastings could do the same.”</p>
<p>A somber silence followed Pisces’ pronouncement. Ceria rolled her eyes as everyone else deciphered his statement.</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>That was all Erin said. She sat back as the others sipped at their drinks. After a moment, Erin felt moved to speak again.</p>
<p>“Did you sleep well? I can bring more blankets or pillows if you need it.”</p>
<p>“We’re fine, I think.”</p>
<p>Yvlon nodded and so did the others, although Pisces closed his mouth so suddenly Erin wondered if he had been about to ask for another pillow or three. The woman with perfect blonde hair, beautiful features, and metal fused into her arms stretched slowly, looking as if she had some back pains of her own.</p>
<p>“Too bad we couldn’t sleep in the inn.”</p>
<p>“I’ll say. A covered wagon is hardly appropriate for—”</p>
<p>Ceria kicked Pisces and he scowled and continued.</p>
<p>“—Adventurers of our caliber. Why we had to stay—”</p>
<p>This time Yvlon raised her foot and Pisces shut up. She glanced at Termin, but the wagon driver affected not to have heard Pisces’ comment.</p>
<p>“Just because we have a magic door that doesn’t mean we can waltz off whenever we feel like it, Pisces.”</p>
<p>“But if we remained in the inn, could we not—”</p>
<p>Ceria scowled at Pisces.</p>
<p>“We made a deal, Pisces. Sleeping in a bed in an inn over thirty miles away from here is not the same as staying with the wagon. If there’s an attack, every second counts. The same goes for the road. We have to stay with the wagon in case of trouble.”</p>
<p>“We could rotate a member of the group out to relax while the other three—”</p>
<p>“<em>No.</em>”</p>
<p>Ceria and Yvlon chorused as one. Ksmvr looked between the members of his group and nodded obediently along with them. Pisces sighed and threw up his hands. Erin had to smile—again—and Ceria grinned too. The half-Elf glanced at Erin sideways.</p>
<p>“Besides, there’s no inn to sleep in now. You moved the door, right, Erin?”</p>
<p>“It’s in Octavia’s shop now. Nowhere to sleep, Pisces, unless you fancy sleeping under one of her tables.”</p>
<p>The [Necromancer] opened his mouth—probably to say that was more comfortable than sleeping in a wagon in the open—and closed it. Pisces could tell when arguing was pointless. Well, sometimes.</p>
<p>“And have more individuals approached you about requisitioning the door for their use? I hardly feel that a lone [Alchemist] can adequately protect such a valuable means of transport.”</p>
<p>“I think Octavia’s pretty good at it, actually. She’s started charging people who wait around in her shop. And you know her—if anyone comes in they’ll either buy half a dozen potions or have their face explode before they go.”</p>
<p>Everyone smiled at that. It turned out that Yvlon and Ceria knew of Octavia by reputation, although neither adventurer had bought directly from her. Yvlon drained her mug and tossed the rest over the side of the wagon.</p>
<p>“She’s probably better at selling potions than she is at making them. There’s no better watchdog you could ask for.”</p>
<p>“Really? I thought Octavia was a really good [Alchemist]. She’s one of three.”</p>
<p>“In a city like Celum? Erin, that’s a lot of [Alchemists]!”</p>
<p>Ceria laughed at her friend. She shook her head.</p>
<p>“Octavia’s good at making potions for cheap. And—I guess she can make some high quality ones, but she stints too much on her ingredients, or so I’ve heard. Then again, it’s expensive to be an [Alchemist].”</p>
<p>“She’s naturally thrifty. Too much so. But I’ve never heard of her making a defective potion—only overselling some to gullible people.”</p>
<p>That made Erin feel better. She nodded as she tugged a blanket over. She’d taken them from Miss Agnes’ inn after a bit of persuasion.</p>
<p>“Well, she tried to charge me a fee for putting the door there, but I talked her out of it. I think she sees how valuable it is.”</p>
<p>“And it will be safe in her shop?”</p>
<p>Ksmvr looked dubious, but Ceria snorted.</p>
<p>“Who’s going to steal a door, let alone one attached to the wall? Besides, that’s just the anchor point. The real artifact is here.”</p>
<p>She rapped a fist on the plain wooden door sitting in the wagon. Everyone else nodded, and Erin patted the door appreciatively.</p>
<p>“Ow! Hey, does this thing have splinters?”</p>
<p>“Not as of such. It’s too well enchanted to break. It’s a hundred times stronger than you are…so in the worst case scenario you could rip your flesh off on a rough patch of it.”</p>
<p>“Aw!”</p>
<p>The door. Erin’s door. She rubbed at the sore palm of her hand as she stared at it.</p>
<p>Yes, magic was a curious thing. Some spells seemed very mundane and just like things Erin had in her world, like Ceria’s trick with warming the mugs. But some things couldn’t be copied, and were just as amazing in this world as they would be in Erin’s.</p>
<p>Like the door. The magical, awesome, incredible, stupendous, phantasmagorical—</p>
<p>Erin frowned. Was phantasmagorical the right word? Anyways, the cool door. It was Erin’s now, and that was wonderful. It meant she could go anywhere with it, conveniently and easily. At least, in theory.</p>
<p>It was only the second day since the door’s incredible useful properties had been harnessed by Pisces and Ceria, but it was already the center of a minor power struggle in Celum. Of course, when Erin and the Horns of Hammerad had first stepped back through it into the Frenzied Hare in Celum, everyone had been dumbstruck. News of the artifact the Horns of Hammerad had recovered had spread like lightning.</p>
<p>You’d think everyone would be <em>happy</em> a magical teleportation-portal door had been created. But the first visitor Erin had received as she and the Horns of Hammerad were having a great dinner that very night in the inn had been a man, a wealthy [Trader] who told Erin he saw big possibilities in her door. He wanted to buy it for a hundred gold coins.</p>
<p>She refused. He upped it to two hundred, and then six hundred coins when she kept refusing. In the end he had to leave, disappointed. That was the start.</p>
<p>The next person to arrive was a rather more influential [Merchant] who told Erin he represented the Merchant’s Guild in the city. He offered her six thousand gold coins for the door immediately, and when she refused he tried to strike a deal with her.</p>
<p>The merchants and traders and indeed, shopkeepers and craftspeople of Celum wanted to use the door as, well, a door into Liscor. If it could be kept open they would reap huge profits that they would share with Erin, all assured her. But just as Erin was considering this, a Runner had come to her inn demanding to speak with her.</p>
<p>Fals, the nice Runner guy that Ryoka had told Erin about came with Garia to plead their case with Erin. They did <em>not</em> want her to let the merchants use the door for anything. After all, it would totally destroy the Runners Guild’s traffic between Celum and Liscor. The last thing Erin wanted was to put anyone out of work, but then the <em>Mage’s Guild</em> had come by to tell Erin that if she wanted to gain a monopoly on messages between Liscor and Celum, she had another thing coming. And then—</p>
<p>And then Erin had clocked one of the merchants and everyone had sort of backed up a bit. But the issue over the door was clear: it was a valuable object and everyone wanted to use it. So that night Erin had had to fend off multiple people wanting to talk to her, people she had never met before except for Garia and Fals.</p>
<p>Fals was nice, and the [Merchants] and envoy from the city’s council had been sickeningly fawning. The [Mage] was full of himself until he realized Pisces and Ceria might actually have more levels than him—plus they were Wistram graduates and he was not. Then he was so obsequious Erin wanted to throw up.</p>
<p>Relief had come from Pisces of all people. Undeterred by the argument, he’d managed to affix the anchoring spell or whatever it was to an actual door and harness the teleportation spell to create a portal rather than just transport people. Apparently it wasn’t that hard, or Pisces was just as smart as he said. According to Ceria, it was a bit of both.</p>
<p>What Pisces had discovered was that powerful the door might be, but it drank more mana than a sponge. It could teleport someone back and forth many times, and even a group of people. But eventually it <em>would</em> run out, and when it did it would take a long time to recharge.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the amount of mana required to activate the spell was understandably high. Both Pisces and Ceria had tried to recharge the door and only managed to juice it up enough for the Horns of Hammerad to make a one-way trip to the wagon to guard it overnight. And they’d still had to use a few mana potions.</p>
<p>So what was the conclusion? Well, the Merchant’s Guild still wanted to use the door as a faster way of transport, the Runner’s Guild and Mage’s Guild were afraid Erin would bulk transport things like letters which didn’t have much mass and could be teleported easily, and Erin realized she didn’t trust Miss Agnes with the door in her inn.</p>
<p>So she’d told everyone to go away and put the door in Octavia’s shop. As for the rest…</p>
<p>“I promised Fals and Garia—the Runner’s Guild—that I wouldn’t transport any letters or deliveries. Only personal stuff I’m using. I said the same thing to the Mage’s Guild so they’re happy. But the city wanted to use my door for emergencies, they said.”</p>
<p>“The city or the mayor? Is Celum ruled by a council or a mayor? I thought they were like Remendia and Ocre and had elected leaders.”</p>
<p>“Nope. Mayor. And guess who wants my door?”</p>
<p>“A lot of [Merchants] and guild leaders?”</p>
<p>Erin nodded miserably. Pisces snorted and Ceria rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“So they want to take it from you. Predictable.”</p>
<p>“Not <em>take</em>…but they want me to pay fees for using it. Or…I could let them use the door if they need it to, I dunno, transport supplies or do something really important. They’d be able to use it in case of emergencies, they said.”</p>
<p>Pisces looked as if he was ready to spit. He pursed his lips and sniffed before wiping his nose on his robe.</p>
<p>“Hah. If you agreed to that, then no doubt every day the city would face a crisis of unprecedented severity that required usage of the door.”</p>
<p>Erin nodded sadly. She had to be selfish or the door would be useless.</p>
<p>“I told them it’s mine and they can’t charge me because I’m not going through the gates.”</p>
<p>Yvlon’s eyebrows rose.</p>
<p>“Really? And what did they say?”</p>
<p>The [Innkeeper] fidgeted on the cart, avoiding anyone’s eyes.</p>
<p>“I uh, hinted that you, the Horns of Hammerad, would be really upset if they did. So they backed down.”</p>
<p>Silence. And then Ceria laughed.</p>
<p>“Hah!”</p>
<p>Pisces and Termin guffawed and Yvlon smiled. Ksmvr just looked around, confused.</p>
<p>“I do not understand the joke. Pisces, please explain it to me.”</p>
<p>Ceria shook her head, and Erin blinked as her hair caught the light. She was still beautiful, too much so for this world. Otherworldly.</p>
<p>“Well, that settles that. I guess the only thing you’ve got to worry about is it being stolen, although Pisces is right. Anyone with a brain will see that the door’s useless if they steal the anchor. People without a brain are the ones you should be worried about, though.”</p>
<p>Erin looked away as Ceria smiled at her.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that’s a problem. I talked with Wesle and the captain of the Watch and they told me they’d keep an eye on Octavia’ shop. Plus, no one likes to try and rob an [Alchemist] because all kinds of things can happen with all those potions lying around.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded.</p>
<p>“That’s true. Good thing you’ve got a [Guardsman] for a friend. In Celum, I mean.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me, but I still do not understand the joke. Pisces, will you explain it to me?”</p>
<p>“Former [Guardsman], actually. He quit his job.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Erin smiled as the Horns of Hammerad exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Yeah. He says he’s earning a ton more than he ever did as a [Guardsman] and he likes acting better. He wants to form a troupe—a group that goes from city to city to perform. They’re stuck in Celum now, but since I can go back whenever, I’ll teach them more plays and they’ll keep practicing.”</p>
<p>“That’s wonderful, it sounds like you’ve really had an impact on the city, Erin.”</p>
<p>“Yeah! And with this door I’m gonna get a lot of customers when I get back. I have big plans—but you were saying it might be useful in other ways, right?”</p>
<p>“Comrade Pisces. I do not understand the j—”</p>
<p>“<em>Shut up!</em>”</p>
<p>Pisces shouted at Ksmvr. The Antinium fell silent for a second.</p>
<p>“If I am silent, will you explain the joke?”</p>
<p>He got along well with Pisces, in the sense that he was the only person who annoyed Pisces and not the other way around. Erin waited patiently, grinning as Pisces laboriously explained the joke to Ksmvr who had a weak grasp of humor at best.</p>
<p>“Ah. I see. This is more humor to raise morale. I will remember it. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Pisces somewhat huffily adjusted his position as he lounged on a few pillows.</p>
<p>“You’re welcome. Now, as I was saying, this door <em>is</em> useful. I have no idea if it has an upper range, but I suspect with a modicum of effort on my and Springwalker’s part we could form multiple anchoring points for usage.”</p>
<p>“What? You mean I could go to all kinds of cities?”</p>
<p>Erin was enthralled by the idea. But Pisces raised a cautionary hand.</p>
<p>“A few. Very few, I believe. Connecting to multiple points risks entanglement, and that could result in a tangled web of magic that could have any number of effects. I would hesitate to create more than four focal points. But I suggest that if you link the door to two more cities for very sporadic usage, you might consider giving one anchoring point to our group.”</p>
<p>“Really? Why?”</p>
<p>“Remember how Pisces said the door could be used as an emergency getaway, Erin? Well, if he can make something easy to carry, we could use the door to get away if we’re ever in trouble, in a dungeon, say.”</p>
<p>Erin paused. She looked over at Ceria and her eye caught on the half-Elf’s skeletal hand. Erin couldn’t help it. She knew it was rude to stare, but sometimes she did stare at Ceria. Her hand, and her friend. Erin didn’t have many friends and she’d been overjoyed to see Ceria—and Pisces and Yvlon and Ksmvr again. When she thought of the dungeon, of Skinner—</p>
<p>“Of course I’ll let you have one. If it works. I mean, would it work for multiple people and if you’re far away or underground?”</p>
<p>Pisces sniffed all-importantly as eyes turned towards him.</p>
<p>“Of course there will be necessary experimentation. And yes, such a fallback would have limitations. But better to have it than not, agreed?”</p>
<p>Everyone nodded. Erin felt happy at the idea—not only could she go to more cities, she might be able to help her friends! But she’d have to be careful with the door, definitely. Maybe she could put it upstairs, so people didn’t use it by accident? Or—could she build a basement in the inn? Surely Klbkch could help her with that, right? She had the money to pay the Antinium now too.</p>
<p>And then it happened. Erin was sitting up in the wagon, about to ask Pisces whether the anchor stones would work if she’d exhausted the door’s power for the day, or whether she’d need to always keep a reserve—when she felt the world explode.</p>
<p>Erin had been in a fire drill, countless fire drills and earthquake drills in school. Even when she knew one was scheduled, she hated the moment of fear and panic that occurred when every single bell started ringing as loudly as possible. But that was only external sound, loud and frightening but only that. Bells <em>in</em> your head were a different matter.</p>
<p>It was as if every alarm clock, siren, fire alarm and noisemaker suddenly went off in Erin’s head at once. She doubled over, clutching her head and crying out in surprise and fear. Dimly, Erin heard Ceria and Termin doing the same.</p>
<p>“Miss Solstice? Erin, is something wrong? Are we in danger?”</p>
<p>Ksmvr was shaking Erin by the shoulder. She tried to explain, tried to speak past the terrible fear in her head.</p>
<p>“Something’s—”</p>
<p>And then she saw someone standing in the cart’s way. Instantly, Ksmvr let go of Erin and reached for the blades at his side. The Horns of Hammerad leapt off the wagon, the genial atmosphere of moments ago forgotten. There was danger, and here was someone who <em>had not been standing there a moment ago.</em></p>
<p>“Teleportation? Ceria, how bad—”</p>
<p>“Ceria?”</p>
<p>“Bad! It’s—we have to retreat.”</p>
<p>“I will attack first. Please, withdraw if I am slain.”</p>
<p>“What’s happening? My [Dangersense]—wait, is it coming from him?”</p>
<p>A confused babble of voices broke through the ringing in Erin’s head. She managed to make the sound lessen, and stood up on the cart as the horses neighed, sensing the alarm around them.</p>
<p>A man was standing in the middle of the snowy road. He shouldn’t have been there. The roads were practically deserted in the wake of the Goblin armies roaming about, and what travelers there were didn’t dare move alone unless they were Runners.</p>
<p>And this man—was no runner. Erin’s eyes widened when she saw him. He stood over six feet tall, a giant. He was powerfully built, imposing, with the body that every man probably dreamed of having. He looked like a superhuman athlete, and yet he was <em>old.</em> He had a white beard, white robes that were brilliant, made of some incredibly rich fabric that seemed brighter and cleaner than the snow itself—</p>
<p>And two eyes of mismatched color. Cerulean and heliotrope. Blue and violet, shimmering colors like celestial bodies shining forth from his pupils. Erin hesitated because she thought they looked so <em>familiar…</em></p>
<p>But he had not been on the road a moment ago. He had appeared and that was terrifying in itself. One second the road was empty, and in the moment between looking elsewhere and turning back, he was there, as if he’d been there all along or he’d been in the peripherals of your vision and you hadn’t noticed until now.</p>
<p>And the [Dangersense] in Erin’s head blared. It was telling her of danger, immediate and pressing. She stared at the man as he stood silently in front of the wagon. Danger. Danger. <em>Danger.</em> It was a cacophony of ringing alarms.</p>
<p>The message was clear: do not fight this man. Run away. Do not fight.</p>
<p>You will die.</p>
<p>And yet the Horns of Hammerad formed a semicircle around the cart, weapons raised. Yvlon had no armor, Pisces and Ceria had only the magic that shimmered around their palms. Ksmvr held weapons in the three arms he possessed. They were shouting.</p>
<p>At Erin?</p>
<p>“Get through the door, Erin! You too, wagon driver!”</p>
<p>“You there. Identify yourself.”</p>
<p>“Don’t attack! Not yet! Pisces—”</p>
<p>“Through the door, Erin! Now!”</p>
<p>Erin wanted to move, but she wanted to stay as well. It was just an old man. True, one that looked like—well, looked like no actual Human being she’d ever seen but—was he dangerous? How could he be?</p>
<p>The old man was just staring at her. Her, out of all the others. He was looking up at the blue sky, around at the snowy landscape, the empty road, at the wagon, and then at Erin. As if he was taking in the sights. But he seemed to be annoyed by all the shouting. He raised one hand.</p>
<p>“Silence.”</p>
<p>And there was. Because everyone was waiting to see what he was going to do next. Erin saw Termin trying to soothe his horses. She looked at the door, and knew she could seize the handle and be in Octavia’s shop in a moment. But what about her friends? And couldn’t he follow them?</p>
<p>“Greetings, Human.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr spoke in the silence, ignoring the annoyed look the man gave him. He lowered the short sword and daggers in his hands as he nodded to the old man.</p>
<p>“We are Silver-ranked adventurers. The Horns of Hammerad. May I ask why you have blocked our path?”</p>
<p>“I wish to speak with her.”</p>
<p>Erin felt a jolt as his finger pointed straight at her. The reaction of her friends was immediate. They closed ranks in front of the wagon.</p>
<p>“May I ask why?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter, does it?”</p>
<p>Ksmvr seemed to freeze up as the multi-colored stare swung towards him. And then Erin saw another aspect of the old man. He stared down at Ksmvr as if he was, well, a bug. He looked at Ceria, Yvlon, Pisces, all clearly adventurers, with the same casual disdain for their existence. Only Erin he looked at with…</p>
<p>“Move aside, adventurers. Or I will move you.”</p>
<p>That was a threat. Erin felt herself shiver. Ceria’s voice was very serious as she held a hand up.</p>
<p>“We don’t want…to fight. But unless you tell us why you want to speak with Erin—and we’re sure you don’t intend her harm—we can’t let you do anything, Human.”</p>
<p>“I intend to explain nothing to you, half-Elf.”</p>
<p>There was no compromise in his voice. Erin saw Ceria tense.</p>
<p>“You don’t have a choice here. Tell us why you want Erin.”</p>
<p>“Otherwise?”</p>
<p>The question caught everyone off guard. The old man looked at Ceria. She hesitated.</p>
<p>“What—do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Otherwise, what? If I refuse, what will you do? Will you prevent me from speaking with this girl?”</p>
<p>“If necessary. If you refuse to cooperate, we will have no choice but to fight.”</p>
<p>Yvlon called that out. She was holding the sword in her hands without a sign that the metal in her arms was bothering her. And her gaze was intent on the old man’s face. She sensed it too, Erin realized. Whoever this old man was, he wasn’t—normal.</p>
<p>For a moment the old man sighed. He looked impatient, annoyed—but not the least bit intimidated. He cast his gaze towards the sky, thought for a moment, and then…nodded.</p>
<p>“That would be the quickest way. Very well.”</p>
<p>What happened next was too fast for Erin to follow. In the moments afterwards as she ducked and Termin yelled in fright beside her, Erin realized what had happened.</p>
<p>The instant the old man had said that, Ceria had acted first. She’d raised her skeletal hand and fired a spike of ice straight at his midriff. It was a killing attack, but it hadn’t touched him.</p>
<p>Instead, the spear of ice had shattered midflight, filling the air with shards of ice that bounced off the wagon. Erin dared to peek her head up and saw the Horns of Hammerad staring at the old man.</p>
<p>He hadn’t moved from that spot. He’d only raised his hand. Erin saw three fingers pointed at the spot where the [Ice Spike] had been shattered by something.</p>
<p>“[Stone Dart]. A low level spell, but all I am capable of here. However, it seems only ah, Tier 2 spells will be necessary here at any rate.”</p>
<p>That was all he said. Erin felt the Horns of Hammerad pause—and then Ceria raised her hand and attacked and the battle began.</p>
<p>“[Ice Dart]!”</p>
<p>Erin had never seen Ceria fire so many ice darts so quickly. They flew at the old man like a rain of missiles—and he blocked them. His hand moved up, caught and shattered a piece of ice flying towards his face, one towards his chest—</p>
<p>So quick! How was he doing it? Erin saw the old man step backwards casually among the hail of missiles. Then he raised his other hand and spoke.</p>
<p>“[Mud Slap].”</p>
<p>A splash of dark brown liquid spattered across the distance between him and Ceria. Erin saw her friend cry out, but it was just mud. In her eyes. But it made the rain of darts stop and then Erin saw what the old man had been blocking them with.</p>
<p>A rock. Just a flat stone. The old man tossed it on the ground.</p>
<p>“[Call Object]. Next?”</p>
<p>He had only a moment to say that. From his left and right Ksmvr and Yvlon came charging at him, blades swinging. The old man nodded, swept his hands out. A flurry of snow blew at both warriors.</p>
<p>“[Frozen Wind].”</p>
<p>They ran through it, half-blinded, but still ready to strike. But then something happened. Erin saw Yvlon and Ksmvr both go down, crashing to the ground but she didn’t see <em>how.</em> And then Pisces—</p>
<p>He was raising the dead. Termin cried out and his horses tried to drag the wagon around as eight skeletons burst out of the ground. Pisces grinned as they tore themselves out of the earth—</p>
<p>“[Stone Dart]. Bludgeoning type.”</p>
<p>The old man pointed and eight stones appeared and struck each skeleton. Not in the head or ribs, but at their spines as they attempted to form themselves. The stones shattered bone and broke the delicate assembly process. Each skeleton collapsed onto the ground, the animation spell failing in an instant.</p>
<p>“Pisces! I’ll—”</p>
<p>“[Stone Dart].”</p>
<p>Another bit of stone struck Ceria in the head as she wiped the last of the mud from her eyes. She crumbled, and the old man sighed.</p>
<p>“Do modern mages not know any protective spells? Or are you truly untrained amateurs?”</p>
<p>He turned to point at Yvlon who was getting to her feet—</p>
<p>And leaned backwards as a burning sword nearly ran him through. Pisces drew back the rapier in his hands as magical flames danced along its length. Erin gasped—she hadn’t seen him move, but he’d covered the distance between him and the old man in an instant!</p>
<p>“[Flash Step]. And a variation of [Flame Rapier]. Well, interesting.”</p>
<p>The old man commented as he stepped backwards. Pisces thrust, but the old man raised his hands and ten [Stone Darts] flew from every finger. Erin heard a curse and Pisces seemed to appear several steps away. His robe and the arm beneath it were cut, but he was uninjured.</p>
<p>“Come, then.”</p>
<p>Pisces took a step to run the old man through—</p>
<p>And tripped.</p>
<p>This time Erin saw what had happened. As he moved and his form vanished, a tiny, twisting loop of grass had sprung up in the snow. It snagged his foot as he moved forwards at lightning speed. The grass strands broke, but it sent Pisces crashing and tumbling to the ground.</p>
<p>“[Tripgrass].”</p>
<p>The old man said it belatedly, as if announcing the spell was an afterthought. The old man walked over to Pisces. The young [Necromancer] snarled and raised his hands—</p>
<p>And the old [Mage] kicked him in the head. Erin shouted, but Pisces just fell back unconscious. Not…dead. He couldn’t be.</p>
<p>The old man turned towards Erin. Then he glanced to one side.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Yvlon and Ksmvr charged towards him, the Antinium throwing one of the daggers in his hands. Again, a precise strike from the [Stone Dart] easily deflected the dagger. But they were closing in. Yvlon raised her sword with a cry, and the man clapped his hands together.</p>
<p>“[Flash].”</p>
<p>This time Erin went blind. She clapped a hand to her eyes and tried to blink to see. She heard shouting, and then a choking sound. When she could see past the spots in her eyes she looked again and saw Yvlon on the ground. The woman was choking. Choking on—snow?</p>
<p>“[Snowball]. Or is it [Create Snow]? Ah, either one works.”</p>
<p>The old man had <em>hit</em> Yvlon in her open mouth with snow. It was filling her throat and she was trying to throw up, get it out. Ksmvr was the only one left on his feet.</p>
<p>“Die.”</p>
<p>He swung his blade towards the old mage’s head. Flames engulfed him.</p>
<p>“[Flame Jet].”</p>
<p>The old man’s voice came from the center of the flames. Ksmvr scythed forwards, but the flames hadn’t just burned him. They’d screened the old man and he walked past Ksmvr on the left, raising his hands again. As the Antinium turned, ten shards of ice pierced his chest. Not deep, but they sent him staggering back.</p>
<p>“Throw down your weapon, insect.”</p>
<p>“Never.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr raised his blade and then a blast of water struck him in the face. It made him overbalance and stumble back again. And a stone was right behind his left foot, hovering there. Ksmvr fell backwards. He tried to roll over—</p>
<p>And couldn’t. Erin saw grass growing all around him, looping around his arms, pulling him to the ground and holding him there. Each blade of grass was weak, but together it enmeshed him so thoroughly he couldn’t move.</p>
<p>The old man walked over to Ksmvr. The Antinium spoke to him, lying flat on his back.</p>
<p>“If you let me live I will not cease until you or I lie dead.”</p>
<p>“Yes, your kind is like that.”</p>
<p>The old man pointed down at Ksmvr. He opened his mouth and then tilted his head sideways. The dagger flashed past his head, missing completely.</p>
<p>Erin gaped. The old man flicked his attention to Ksmvr, and then stepped away from the Antinium. He nodded at the dagger which was now buried in the snow.</p>
<p>“Hm. You have a Skill, don’t you? But perfect aim is meaningless if you allow me time to dodge. Without more Skills you would not be able to strike even a cat with such a throw.”</p>
<p>He sounded so nonchalant. He’d taken apart her friends with basic spells in an instant and—</p>
<p>On the wagon, Erin hesitated. Part of her told her to run, to get away and be safe. Her sensible self rationalized it. He wanted her for some reason. If she ran, the old man might let her friends live.</p>
<p>But not Ksmvr. So Erin clenched her fists. She leapt from the wagon with a yell—</p>
<p>And tripped as something snagged her leg going over the side. Erin had only a moment to yelp before she smacked into the ground hard. She groaned—she hadn’t landed in the snow, only on frozen ground. And falling from a wagon headfirst <em>hurt</em>. If she hadn’t managed to catch the fall on her arms she might have broken her skull, but she felt like her arms were broken instead.</p>
<p>“[Tripgrass]. Again.”</p>
<p>Erin had to get up. She pushed herself up groggily and saw the old man looming over her. She yelped, threw a punch with all her strength.</p>
<p>He caught it. It was a [Minotaur Punch] and he caught it. Erin blinked at the incredible strength in the man’s body. True, he looked like he was strong enough for it, but—</p>
<p>He released her, and Erin stumbled back. She stared at him, fists half-raised. She felt like she had long ago, in front of Gazi. As if anything she did would be useless. The old man stared around, and then at Termin. The wagon driver was sitting white-faced in his driver’s seat.</p>
<p>“Will you try to fight as well?”</p>
<p>Termin stared back, paralyzed by fear. The white-bearded stranger nodded, and turned to Erin. She tensed—</p>
<p>And he held up an iPhone.</p>
<p>“You are Erin Solstice, aren’t you? Explain this to me.”</p>
<p>Erin stopped. All processes went on immediate halt. She lowered her hands. Her mind went blank. She stared at the small, metallic object in the old man’s hands. Its screen was glowing, and it looked so familiar to her. But—</p>
<p>She stared at the old man. At the iPhone.</p>
<p>“That’s an iPhone.”</p>
<p>“Yes. It is. And it seems to be malfunctioning, although I copied it completely.”</p>
<p>“That’s Ryoka’s iPhone.”</p>
<p>The world had stopped making sense. Erin stared at the old man while she waited for someone to wake her up from the dream she was having. He nodded to her, impatient.</p>
<p>“A copy. See—this.”</p>
<p>The old man pointed to the small, glowing screen. Erin peered down at the app his finger was pointing at.</p>
<p>“Oh. Safari. That’s an…that’s the internet app.”</p>
<p>“Is it?”</p>
<p>The old man frowned at Erin. He tapped the app and a screen popped up, glowing, white, before the typical ‘no internet’ page flashed on screen.</p>
<p>“You see? I am missing something for it to work. What connection do I need to obtain?”</p>
<p>“Um.”</p>
<p>Erin stared blankly at the screen, and then at the frowning face in front of her. She felt like her brain was trying to work a million miles a second while crawling along at a snail’s pace. She answered automatically as best she could.</p>
<p>“Well, you need internet. But uh, you don’t have internet here. No one in this…this world does. So…it’s not gonna work.”</p>
<p>“I see. That is inconvenient. Well then, am I to assume these other functions do not work for the same reason?”</p>
<p>The old man clicked a button and the iPhone went back to the menu screen. Erin peered at the iPhone, nodding her head.</p>
<p>“Youtube? Oh—that’s for watching videos. Yeah, it needs internet too.”</p>
<p>“But there are videos on this device.”</p>
<p>“Oh—those are downloaded. Uh, they’re part of it. Youtube needs…the internet.”</p>
<p>“Ah. And the store? This one?”</p>
<p>“Spotify? Yeah. Same problem.”</p>
<p>“I see. How tedious. Is there any other function I may have missed?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I have listened to every song and watched every ‘video’ on this device. I have solved the riddle of this particular function—”</p>
<p>“You mean the app? 2048? The game?”</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s what they’re called? App. Hm. And yes, it was a quite entertaining game, or rather, logic puzzle. But is there anything else I can do with this device?”</p>
<p>“Well, you could—hold on.”</p>
<p>Erin raised her hand and stared at it. Then she slapped herself as hard as she could. Her head rang a bit.</p>
<p>“Ow!”</p>
<p>“That looked painful.”</p>
<p>“It was. Sorry. Well…you can take notes with the iPhone. See here?”</p>
<p>“Ah yes. And record what is spoken. A useful function, no doubt.”</p>
<p>“And—oh, Ryoka had Triple Town. See—”</p>
<p>Erin found the iPhone nearly snatched out of her hands. The old man stared down at the screen, eyes bulging.</p>
<p>“How did you <em>do </em>that? I couldn’t fathom how I did it once. But you’ve changed the screen!”</p>
<p>“Hm? You didn’t know? You can change the screen since there are more apps. See? You swipe left. Like this…”</p>
<p>“Swipe left. Fascinating.”</p>
<p>Erin stared at the old man as he clumsily moved his fingers across the screen. She felt compelled to reach for the one straw of rationality she had in this moment.</p>
<p>“I’m surprised…Ryoka didn’t tell you how the iPhone worked. Because this is totally something she gave you, right?”</p>
<p>“Hm? Candy Crush? Intriguing. Oh yes, I received this from her.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>The young woman nodded a few times. The old man was mumbling to himself, mostly along the lines of ‘fascinating’, or ‘yes, this certainly deserves closer study’. Erin stared at him.</p>
<p>“What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Teriarch. Mm. I can see there is much I have yet to explore. Tell me, I encountered a terrible problem when I went here. To settings, see? And I pressed—”</p>
<p>“Ooh, yeah. Reset. Don’t do that. It gets rid of everything.”</p>
<p>“So I had noticed. But why does it exist?”</p>
<p>“Um. So you can put other things on the device? If you had the internet I mean.”</p>
<p>“Really? How?”</p>
<p>Erin stared at Teriarch. She stared into his multicolored eyes and wondered if today was a good day or not.</p>
<p>“Uh, well, you can’t here. It’s impossible.”</p>
<p>“Ah. Well then, I shall make do with these new…apps. Thank you for your help, Erin Solstice.”</p>
<p>“Oh. No problem…have we met before?”</p>
<p>Teriarch paused. He raised his head from the screen he’d been staring at obsessively and looked at Erin. For the first time he looked into her face, rather than just at her as an object to be interacted with. And he frowned.</p>
<p>“You do look…familiar. How odd. I should know anyone I have encountered. But I…hrm. I think we have met.”</p>
<p>Erin nodded slowly. He seemed familiar. But from where?</p>
<p>“Well…you’re a friend of Ryoka? Or she knows you?”</p>
<p>“She has performed tasks for me before, yes.”</p>
<p>“Oh. I see. You’re her…mysterious client?”</p>
<p>Teriarch frowned, and Erin realized she might have violated Ryoka’s contract of silence or whatever. But Ryoka had never told her who Teriarch was, just that she’d met with someone who was powerful and could cast magic. Teriarch studied Erin slowly and nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes. I am a…mage. Of quite significant ability.”</p>
<p>“I can tell. Um. Are my friends going to be alright?”</p>
<p>Teriarch looked dismissively at the Horns of Hammerad. Erin saw Yvlon was on her knees, still coughing. She thought Pisces had one eye open, but both were closed when she looked again. Ceria was still out and Ksmvr was watching them silently.</p>
<p>What should she do now? Teriarch was clearly absorbed in the iPhone. He kept asking Erin what various apps Ryoka had downloaded did. Ryoka had quite a few games on her iPhone. More than one Erin was tickled to know Ryoka played, or had played in the past.</p>
<p>It was surreal. Teriarch was just…interested. He kept <em>harrumphing</em> importantly, but he was keenly fascinated with the iPhone. He had just beaten up her friends, but he’d left them alive. He didn’t seem evil. More like…odd? And Erin kept staring at him, feeling that tickling in her memory.</p>
<p>But something prompted Erin to break off from her explanation of how to play Angry Birds and frown. The warning bells in her head hadn’t died away. Rather, it was as if they had faded during the fight to let her think and act without being overwhelmed, but now that it was over they were still blaring loudly, telling her—</p>
<p>“Are you um, going to kill us?”</p>
<p>Teriarch paused and stared at Erin with a mixture of indignation and confusion.</p>
<p>“Me? Why would I kill you?”</p>
<p>“Well, you attacked us.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>That came from behind Teriarch and Erin. She turned and saw Ceria was standing upright, supported by Pisces on one side and Yvlon on the other. Ksmvr was still tied to the ground, calling out for aid now that the danger had passed.</p>
<p>“Help. I am stuck to the ground.”</p>
<p>“Ah. See, Erin Solstice? Your friends are alive and mostly unharmed.”</p>
<p>Teriarch gestured as Ksmvr sat up. Ceria blinked a few times at him, eyes partially unfocused. Erin hoped she didn’t have a concussion—Ceria just looked woozy.</p>
<p>“You attacked us. Why?”</p>
<p>“You were in my way.”</p>
<p>The sky was blue. The grass was green. It was a matter-of-fact statement that made Yvlon grit her teeth angrily. Erin just stared at Teriarch, feeling that same disconnect. He went on, arrogant, trying to score three stars in a level of Angry Birds.</p>
<p>“Explaining would have been a waste of my time. And this was entertaining, however easy it was.”</p>
<p>The Horns of Hammerad stared at Teriarch. He frowned as one of the pigs escaped destruction.</p>
<p>“How did you do it?”</p>
<p>Pisces was next to speak. He stared at Teriarch wide-eyed, with more respect than Erin had ever seen in him in his life.</p>
<p>“You—all you were using were Tier 2 spells at best. But the style of your spellcasting—”</p>
<p>“Elementary. Any competent mage should be able to do as much, if not so quickly or with the same mana supply. You should be ashamed of yourselves not to have any counters against such low level spells.”</p>
<p>Teriarch shrugged. He nodded at Ceria.</p>
<p>“You should go to Wistram, half-Elf. With a decade of studying you may become a powerful mage yet.”</p>
<p>“We did go to Wistram.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Teriarch’s eyebrows rose in disbelief. He stared at Pisces but seemed to ascertain that the mage was not lying. Teriarch snorted angrily.</p>
<p>“Standards have fallen greatly, then. Your spellcasting was beyond inferior. That was a decent attack with a sword I suppose, but unless you <em>are</em> a [Spellsword] or some other mage-warrior hybrid, I suggest you focus on magic.”</p>
<p>“Um.”</p>
<p>Erin raised her hand. She just felt like it was the thing to do. All eyes focused on her. Erin tapped her head.</p>
<p>“My [Dangersense] is still going off. Are you really not going to kill us, Teriarch?”</p>
<p>“Me? No. But…hrm.”</p>
<p>Teriarch stared off into the distance. His lips moved soundlessly, then he nodded.</p>
<p>“Ah. That explains much of your hostility. Your senses were alerted by a nearby Goblin Army. It is passing this way.”</p>
<p>“An army?”</p>
<p>The Horns of Hammerad went pale. Erin felt a jolt of fear in her chest, but she looked at the wagon. It was Termin of all people who wailed and clutched at his hair.</p>
<p>“Goblins! What will I do? Fox and Erma will be eaten for sure!”</p>
<p>Fox and Erma? Erin remembered those were Termin’s horses. She stared at the animals, feeling a jolt in her chest. Could they push the animals through the door? But if they did—what if the Goblins opened the door? Could they seal it off, then? But how would they get back?</p>
<p>Teriarch raised one eyebrow as Yvlon tried to convince Termin they had to leave his mounts behind. Pisces already had the door up and was yelling at Ksmvr to help him find a spot to hide it from the Goblins. Erin saw Teriarch tap Ceria on the head when no one was watching. Ceria frowned, blinked, and seemed to regain focus.</p>
<p>“Um, Mister Teriarch.”</p>
<p>He glanced at her, still holding the iPhone in one hand.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Can you help us? I dunno, somehow evade the Goblins?”</p>
<p>“You should be able to do it yourselves without my help. Unless—are you really planning to flee?”</p>
<p>“What would you do?”</p>
<p>Ceria stared at Teriarch. He looked incredulous.</p>
<p>“This is winter. The Goblin army is marching this way, but they are hardly filled with adept trackers and they do not know you are here. Conjure a snowstorm and evade them.”</p>
<p>The half-Elf shook her head instantly.</p>
<p>“We can’t do that. Pisces and I—neither of us know [Snowstorm] as a spell, and we’re not nearly high-level enough to cast it, let alone to affect such a large—”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Teriarch looked impatient. He began to lecture Ceria, much to Erin’s incredulity.</p>
<p>“[Snowstorm]? Why do you need to <em>create</em> snow? If you were standing in a jungle I could see the need, but you have an ample supply of snow right here. Use that. Even a Tier…1 spell should do.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>Ceria’s ears drooped slightly, as Teriarch’s glare pierced her in place.</p>
<p>“Are you <em>really</em> Wistram mages? Here. Like this. You—[Necromancer]! Come over here and help your friend!”</p>
<p>Pisces ran over as Teriarch walked over to a large expanse of snow and began ordering Ceria about. Erin stared at him as Yvlon and Ksmvr and Termin all stopped what they were doing to watch.</p>
<p>There wasn’t too much happening. Teriarch was just pointing to the ground at something the two mages could see and berating them. They kept flinching as he grew more and more impatient with them.</p>
<p>“There. Anchor the spell there and cast multiple incarnations of it—no, not like that! Why are you using your mana so poorly? A proper spell is efficient! And you—half-Elf! You’re wasting the energy of your spell with uncontrolled winds. The two of you cast in tandem like—well, that is barely acceptable.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a gust of wind blew up, carrying a huge amount of snow with it. Teriarch nodded as Erin and the others gasped. The wind began to blow, and as he lent his power to the wind spells, it began to blow down the road. Erin turned to Termin, and pointed to the wagon.</p>
<p>“Um. Let’s get out of the way?”</p>
<p>He stared at her, face pale as the snow began whipping into the air. Then he scrambled towards the driver’s seat with the others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Goblin army was a massive force, thousands strong. Black-armored warriors marched with the undead, grim, sullen because they hadn’t been able to find any easy prey to kill and eat. Marching in the winter was bad enough with armor, but the stench of the undead made the Goblin warriors upset.</p>
<p>And what was worse, they’d run into a snowstorm. The Goblins grumbled and their scouts withdrew to form a tight perimeter around their army. If they ran into anything in the storm they’d kill it. But they could still follow the road so they pressed onwards until they reached the other side. It was a brief snowstorm, the Goblins reflected. But they took no more notice of it; they had Humans to kill, and other Goblins too for that matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Far away, the wagon Termin was driving rumbled to a stop as Erma and Fox panted in the snow. Erin hopped off the wagon and slowly walked up to the small ridge to see the last of the Goblin army disappearing in the distance.</p>
<p>“Wow.”</p>
<p>That was all she said. She turned back and saw Teriarch, sitting austerely on top of the wagon with an iPhone in hand, looking more out of place than anything she’d ever seen as Ceria and Pisces tried to ask him ten thousand questions at once.</p>
<p>“How did you learn to use magic like that? I’ve never seen spellcasting so—refined! And the way you do it…”</p>
<p>“It is one method of practicing magic. I consider it to be the most efficient. It is certainly superior to your…attempts. How have you not been taught the various schools of magic if you studied at Wistram?”</p>
<p>“We were expelled. We studied for years but…we never fully graduated.”</p>
<p>“We came close. I daresay we were as good as most mages, but Spingwalker is right. Yet we were allowed to claim the name. We are recognized Wistram mages still.”</p>
<p>That was Ceria and Pisces’ guilty confession, but it was hardly as surprising to Erin as the revelation that Teriarch was some kind of super-mage. Or an Archmage. Apparently magic, which Erin understood to be like math in some respects, was all about understanding spells. And Teriarch had shown Pisces and Ceria some shortcuts in magic, or things which he considered basic and they considered miraculous.</p>
<p>“Hmf. Even then. Any first-year student would have had such things drilled into them. At least, if Wistram is acting as a proper institution for education. What happened to Archmage Zelkyr? He would never have let mages sink so low.”</p>
<p>“Archmage…he’s dead. He died over a century ago. Two centuries, I think.”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>Both Pisces and Ceria had that huge-eyed, slaw jawed expression of disbelief Erin was used to getting from time to time. She supposed she should be behaving the same way. Did that mean Teriarch was really old?</p>
<p>“Well, refine yourselves with what I have shown you. Your Skills and…classes should do the rest. You, half-Elf, study the spell I marked in that spellbook. It should compliment your ice magic skills. And you, [Necromancer]…”</p>
<p>He somehow knew what magic both Ceria and Pisces used at a glance. Teriarch sighed.</p>
<p>“We hardly need more necromancers. But I suppose your control of magic is quite good for one so young. Keep practicing.”</p>
<p>He stepped off the wagon. Ksmvr and Yvlon stared at him. Teriarch nodded to Erin. She hesitated.</p>
<p>“Oh. You’re gonna go? Um. Thanks?”</p>
<p>Was that the appropriate response? Teriarch nodded regally to her.</p>
<p>“And thanks to you as well for showing me how this device works. Farewell, Erin Solstice. We shall not meet again.”</p>
<p>That sounded sort of weird. And ominous. Teriarch began to stride through the snow, but Pisces leapt off the wagon and chased after him.</p>
<p>“Master Teriarch! Sir!”</p>
<p>Pisces flung himself at the snow at Teriarch’s feet. The old man looked more annoyed than anything else.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Please take me on as your apprentice! To learn from someone who lived during the time of Archmage Zelkyr—I would do anything for such an honor!”</p>
<p>Teriarch stared down at Pisces as the young man looked up hopefully at him. Erin’s jaw was open. Ceria looked like she was considering doing the same thing. Teriarch stared down at Pisces.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Then he turned and walked away. Pisces ran after him, but it was as if Teriarch was suddenly walking at a different speed than Pisces. He strolled along, but then his form grew further and further away, until he was a speck in the distance. Then he was gone, and Pisces and the others were left alone in the snow.</p>
<p>In the silence that followed Erin wondered whether this was all a dream. She pinched herself.</p>
<p>“Ow. Nope.”</p>
<p>She turned to Ceria, who was pale-faced, clutching the burned spellbook in her hands. At Ksmvr, who was scratching at one of his antennae. At Yvlon, who was staring at where Teriarch had been, and at Pisces, standing forlornly in the snow.</p>
<p>In the end it was Termin who spoke. The older man sucked in his lips, and then shouted as loudly as he could.</p>
<p>“Who the hell was <em>that?</em>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his cave, Teriarch released the spell controlling his Human form at range and settled back into his cave. He created another image of the old man with the white beard and had it pick up the iPhone. The dragon hummed to himself as he flicked through the screens, staring at all the lovely new apps. He muttered to himself as he did.</p>
<p>“Is this what adventurers have sunk to? Ah, well. Perhaps they lied about being Silver-rank adventurers. And it was quite enjoyable to be out, although the outside was so busy…and the light was far too bright. Hmf.”</p>
<p>He paused as a thought came to him. Erin Solstice. He’d only gone to her because Ryoka had been at Reinhart’s estate and hard to reach without dealing with her at length. But she had recognized him and he, her. Where?</p>
<p>The Dragon’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>“The girl.”</p>
<p>For a brief second he considered sending himself out into the world again, to ask the girl how she’d found him. But then Teriarch hesitated, and stared at the iPhone.</p>
<p>The outside was…the outside. He preferred his cave. And he had so much to entertain himself with now. Teriarch put Erin out of his thoughts and went back to tapping buttons on the iPhone.</p>
<p>“Now what’s this? Cookie Clicker?”</p>
<p>The Dragon stared at the screen as it changed colors. He frowned, pondered, and then began to tap.</p>

		<p>This is what she heard in the silence of the night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Tactician Level 16!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Conditions Met: Leader&nbsp;→ Chieftain Class!]</p>
<p>[Chieftain Level 15!]</p>
<p>[Class Consolidation: Scavenger removed.]</p>
<p>[Class Consolidation: Tinkerer removed.]</p>
<p>[Skill – Tribe: Fleet Foot obtained!]</p>
<p>[Skill – Lesser Tinkering obtained!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was like thunder in her mind. The words thundered in Rags head, waking her up instantly from her deep sleep. Unlike other times she’d leveled up, this announcement came towards the end of her rest. But once she had awoken, sleep was only a memory.</p>
<p>She had leveled up. Not only that, she had changed classes. She was a different person than she had been last night. Rags felt it. She was now a Chieftain, both among Goblins and in the eyes of the world.</p>
<p>Oh, sweetness. Rags made herself smile toothily as she sat up next to her personal campfire. She had been waiting a long time to hear those words.</p>
<p>In this world, leveling up was more important than a birthday. It was far more special than any holiday, and in fact constituted an occasion for rejoicing in itself. And so Rags told the rest of her tribe what had happened, knowing full well what would occur next.</p>
<p>A celebration.</p>
<p>Even Goblins partied, rare though such occasions were. It was a mark of a tribe’s wealth that they could celebrate anything. As wrong as Tremborag’s Goblins had been, they’d captured something in their huge banquets that represented Goblin society as a whole.</p>
<p>As dawn broke, the Flooded Waters tribe opened their stores of plundered food and piled wood on the embers of their fires. Goblins ran about, ate, drank what alcohol was available, had sex…</p>
<p>There really wasn’t much to a Goblin party. But it was a time when they could all relax, except for those few unhappy souls who had to keep watch. Rags sat in the center of her camp, content to eat and do little else. That was what being a Goblin was like she reflected; a happy moment was one where you <em>didn’t</em> have to do anything.</p>
<p>Of course, there was some attention paid to her as the center of this celebration. Rags was offered the choicest cut of meat and the best cooked food—although as Chieftain she generally got that anyways. She had her own seat which wasn’t crowded and other Goblins made way for her—again, standard for any Chieftain. But it was enough and appropriate. The only other thing Goblins did was stare at Rags and pat her approvingly as she passed—that got annoying fast for her.</p>
<p>Tremborag’s former Goblins were a bit more formal, however. Rags entertained several groups of Goblins who all congratulated her briefly and gave her small trinkets or choice bits of food. It was ceremony and she scowled at that, but made no comment.</p>
<p>It was just—Rags didn’t feel that good. She sat next to Pyrite, letting him munch on the food she’d been given, trying not to glare as a group of Goblins ran past her, fighting over a large kebab one of the Goblins in front was trying to keep away from the others. She longed to shout at them to share and stop running in case one of the Goblins lost an eye on the poking stick—Goblin parties could have casualties if they got too wild—but she knew that would be pointless.</p>
<p>Rags felt bad and couldn’t explain why. She knew there was reason to celebrate and liked the change in her class. It wasn’t as if she was officially a Chieftain thanks to getting the class, but the Skills and title did help. It was a good thing.</p>
<p>She didn’t feel happy, though. Accomplished—yes. Triumphant—yes. But happy?</p>
<p>No. Rags couldn’t bring herself to smile and rejoice over it like the other Goblins. Not today. She just felt…</p>
<p>Tired. A bit tired, and almost melancholy, which was an odd emotion for a Goblin to have. But whatever feeling was in her, it overwhelmed whatever euphoria Rags should have had.</p>
<p>Why? Perhaps it was because for all this day was a triumph, it wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>Creating crossbows, rebelling against Tremborag, learning how to use pikes, gaining the [Chieftain] class…today Rags could only think how small each of her accomplishments were. She stared moodily into the fire and didn’t gorge herself.</p>
<p>And other Goblins noticed.</p>
<p>It was the consequence of being around so many people who knew you so well, from the way you walked to how you smiled and breathed. Rags could see Pyrite eyeing her as he sat and ate, and she had noticed how other Goblins looked at her before going back to celebrating. They knew their Chieftain was upset, even if they didn’t know why.</p>
<p>But where Goblins differed from Humans and other species with similar characteristics was how they treated Rags. No Goblins went over to hug Rags or ask her how she felt. They left her alone to brood, and that made Rags feel better in itself. It was her problem, and Goblins didn’t like to get involved in problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The party lasted for around three hours until it ended all at once. Goblins stopped eating, mainly because they were full, and the mood in the camp returned to normal in minutes. Sensing the change, Rags stood up and began to shout orders. It was time to get to work.</p>
<p>The first order of the day, which she’d been planning on without the addition of her [Chieftain] class, was testing out her tribe’s warriors. Rags had a new tribe, forged out of many disparate groups. She had to know who she could trust to fight or go hunting, and who she had to keep an eye on and command directly.</p>
<p>So Rags organized a fight. Other races might have called it a sparring session, or a test of arms, or a mock battle. But Goblins knew a brawl when they saw one.</p>
<p>The rules were simple. Rags told all the Goblins to get rid of their armor, their weapons, and grab a stick or non-jagged rock. They formed into whatever groups suited them—some Goblins because they belonged to a group like the Redfang warriors, others because they were friends or family. Then Rags gave the command and all the various groups of Goblins ran at each other and started fighting.</p>
<p>It was <em>not</em> training. Training involved deliberately honing skills or practicing with weapons to become better in combat. Most Goblins didn’t bother to train, although the Redfang warriors were an exception. But this was just a chance for Goblins to settle grudges without killing anyone and a chance for Rags to observe.</p>
<p>She sat on a tree stump as Pyrite sat next to her, chewing on some leftover gristle from the morning. She’d exempted him from the fighting and so he organized Goblins who dropped out of the brawl.</p>
<p>In this case dropping out meant the Goblins had had enough of being pounded on and walked away. Or they were carried if they’d been knocked out. Some of the pregnant female Goblins and younger ones—and ones not inclined to fighting—helped with this. The rest just hit each other.</p>
<p>Rags nodded to herself as she stared into the seething mass of green bodies. Her keen eyes could pick out individual Goblin’s faces in the mass and so she saw what few others could.</p>
<p>The Redfang warriors were in the center of the battle, laying about with sticks and enjoying themselves immensely by the looks of it. They were easily dominating any other Goblins who came at them. However, they were outnumbered and so part of their group got split up. The Redfang warriors bashed their way through the Goblins, aiming for the edge of the fray where they could defend themselves more easily and wait to regroup with their friends.</p>
<p>Rags saw them reach another competent group of fighters. The all-female Goblin group was doing well against regular warriors, fighting with ferocity if not the same skill as the Redfang warriors. Rags paused though, as she saw a familiar head standing out among the rest of the Goblins.</p>
<p>The old Goblin. Rags frowned as she stared at the Goblin with the white beard who was happily tripping other Goblins up and kicking them while they were down. She’d told Pyrite to forbid Hobs from joining in the fight since they were too strong.</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>She reached over and poked Pyrite. He grunted—she’d gotten close to one of his potion-healed belly wounds. Rags glared at him and pointed at the old Goblin.</p>
<p>“Why he there? Hob.”</p>
<p>“He is old. Doesn’t fight fully.”</p>
<p>That was all Pyrite said. It wasn’t a full explanation, but Rags took it to mean Pyrite was looking out for Greybeard. She shrugged and watched his group. Her ears were good enough to hear him. He was pointing and talking to the female Goblin warrior who lead the group.</p>
<p>“Mm. Go this way, leader? Is good way.”</p>
<p>Rags narrowed her eyes as the female Goblin warrior hesitated, and then led her Goblins left as the old Goblin had suggested. In the chaotic melee, her band of female Goblins somehow ended up in a perfect flanking position to the Redfang warriors. They helped another band of Goblins drub the elite Goblins until some more Redfang warriors ran into the backs of the Goblins and drove them apart.</p>
<p>That was odd. Had he known which way to go in that chaos? Or was it luck? For that matter , why did he belong with the female Goblins anyways? Rags knew he’d been in their faction in the mountain to survive, but it seemed odd their leader would accept his suggestions.</p>
<p>“He is smart.”</p>
<p>Pyrite told Rags when she asked, and the female Goblin said the same thing as she and her warriors stumbled away from the battle.</p>
<p>“Crafty old one. Worth feeding.”</p>
<p>That was that. Rags watched as the other Goblins kept fighting. It looked like the warriors from Tremborag’s tribe who’d joined her were a bit above her regular warriors in skill, but only just. It still ended with a loss for every Goblin but the Redfang warriors, at least in the sense of who had the most bruises. But Rags was pleased to see Garen Redfang’s best didn’t get out completely unharmed.</p>
<p>That done, Rags let the Hobs do the same thing, only this time they had to fight completely unarmed and all the other Goblins watched. Pyrite declined to fight, but almost all the other Hobs were up for scrap. Rags watched them beat each other energetically and privately agreed with Pyrite’s decision; the old Goblin would have gotten smushed battling these ones.</p>
<p>Hobs were strong. They had to be to be Hobs. Whether they were fat or thin, adept at long-ranged weapons or comfortable with a club, they were simply on a different level than normal Goblins. It bothered Rags a bit, as she watched them. Any one of these Hobs could kill her. If she had her crossbow and sword and shield she might have a chance, but if she missed—</p>
<p>She was a bit weak, wasn’t she?</p>
<p>Troubled, Rags watched the Hobs hit each other until they got bored. She let everyone break and eat lunch while she thought on her seat.</p>
<p>She now had a good idea who her best fighters and leaders were, and which units of Goblins excelled at what. So without further ado, Rags decided to divvy up Tremborag’s cache of weapons and armor right then and there.</p>
<p>Her Goblins hadn’t been idle testing out their new weapons. More than one sword had been blunted by hitting things, which was a pity, but a good whetstone would fix that. More importantly, Rags had an idea of which weapons were truly powerful.</p>
<p>There were only five. A wooden shield with faded paint showing some sort of flower on a field was unbreakable as far as her Goblins had been able to tell. They’d tried to burn it by dropping it in a campfire, had a Hob hit it, and let one of the felled trees drop on it. It didn’t break.</p>
<p>Another sword shocked anyone that touched the blade, fairly badly. It wasn’t a powerful enchantment per se, but it never <em>stopped</em> shocking and never ran out of magic. Any warrior with metal armor trying to block that would soon be numb.</p>
<p>A mace seemed to have the weight of a sledgehammer behind it. Another sword threw molten fire when you swung it hard—Rags eyed a badly burnt group of Goblins and decided not to give that one out. And one chest plate seemed to fracture any non-magical weapon that struck it, breaking the blades badly on impact.</p>
<p>Of course, there were plenty of other lesser magical artifacts. Some were sharper than they should be, others seemed unbreakable or burned or froze or in one case, made whatever they cut really itch. But the best artifacts were those five.</p>
<p>Rags was only slightly disappointed. She knew Tremborag had probably given the best artifacts out, but these were plenty good enough. They were of a higher quality than steel, which meant her warriors were outfitted as well as or better than most city militias. Even Liscor’s City Watch didn’t have magical weapons.</p>
<p>Dividing up the weapons among all of her eager warriors was a chore, though. Rags ended up giving both the shocking sword and the set of armor to Redscar, mainly because he was the highest-leveled warrior. He needed good equipment and besides, none of the Hobs could wear the chest plate. It was big on Redscar, but he could wear it more or less easily.</p>
<p>She would have given the armor to Pyrite if she could. Rags offered him the mace instead, or the sword, but Pyrite declined both. He preferred his axe. So she gave him the shield and he seemed quite pleased.</p>
<p>The last mace went to one of Rags’ Hobs, not one of the Redfang Warrior Hobs. This was purely to appease the Goblins who were upset the Redfang warriors got the bulk of the magical gear. Shields, high-quality armor, swords, and so on went to the delighted warriors. It made sense; they were Rags’ best fighters, but the other Goblins were unhappy.</p>
<p>There were still factions. Or perhaps the Goblins would have been unhappy in any case, but Rags appeased them by making the Redfang warriors give up their original gear and share it with her other warriors. That way, they still received an upgrade in their equipment.</p>
<p>That done, Rags finally let herself have lunch. She took a block of cheese and melted it over some meat and slapped some bread on it and ate it messily by her fire. While she did, Rags gauged the mood of the camp.</p>
<p>The Goblins who’d been upset about not getting magical weapons…were only upset. They sulked for a few minutes and then brightened up at their shiny new steel ones. The Redfang warriors were happy, and Tremborag’s former Goblins…</p>
<p>Seemed content. Some looked a bit disgruntled as they eyed the empty cart where only a few weapons remained—the molten fire sword and a shield that seemed to give any Goblin who held it a rash. Also, a spear that sprouted thorns everywhere except two specific handholds; none of the Goblins could remember where they were and kept getting their hands spiked. But Tremborag’s Goblins understood that giving the weapons away was better than locking them up.</p>
<p>And Noears? Rags saw him eating happily and shooting lightning to impress a female Goblin—he hadn’t cared about the weapons at all. Mages were like that.</p>
<p>Then Rags turned and saw the old Goblin. He was sitting next to Pyrite. Her eyes narrowed as she focused on him, the one oddity out of an otherwise predictable day.</p>
<p>He only acted stupid, Rags felt. She watched as he chattered to Pyrite, eating and laughing hugely as the other Hob ate in silence. That informed her next decision, much to the surprise of all Goblins.</p>
<p>Rags found that Goblins were best when they were led directly. Even under supervision, she required local group leaders to implement her orders. So she took her Hobs and divided them among her various groups. Some Hobs were in charge of leading hunting groups, others took over control of various warrior Groups.</p>
<p>A few Goblins were capable of leading too, of course. Redscar commanded the Redfang warriors as Rags’ mobile attack force and vanguard. And the female Goblin warrior—Rags had learned her nickname was Poisonbite thanks to the two poisoned daggers she wielded—Rags put in command of another group.</p>
<p>Her tribe had order. It had leaders. But Rags felt she needed one last thing. She was restless. And after watching the brawl…angry for no reason she could explain. So after a brief consultation with Noears and Poisonbite she struck camp.</p>
<p>Goblins usually organized fast, but all of Rags’ new policies and grouping caused delays. Still, it was best to iron out problems now and get her people used to the new system rather than later, so Rags gritted her teeth and dealt with the slow pace.</p>
<p>It was just hard to get everyone moving in the right formation. Rags wanted order when her tribe marched. Warriors would surround the noncombatants and valuable supplies and move in their units, rather than mix with non-warrior Goblins. It was a good idea, but hard to implement.</p>
<p>The new pikes proved to be another problem. The tribe had felled countless trees and fashioned hundreds of them, but they were just cumbersome to carry. They were obviously long and though they were actually lighter than they looked for being so tall—Rags guessed they were only around thirteen pounds in weight—they were still far heavier than a sword. Goblins had to work to carry them together, or if they were strapped to a wagon, they were so long they were in good danger of smacking Hobs or other obstacles as the wagons moved.</p>
<p>Rags sorted it out. Some Goblins could carry, and she had a few wagons modified to carry hundreds of pikes at one time. She yelled and bossed Goblins about and in the end she got her tribe moving.</p>
<p>They had to keep moving. It was just what Rags felt was right. She was missing something important. Their tribe finally set off, moving fast. Half again as fast as normal, in fact. To Rags’ delight, her skill [Fleet Foot] made her tribe move across the snowy ground with ease. She immediately tried to figure out how to use it to outmaneuver her enemies while marveling at how quickly her tribe could go.</p>
<p>And it meant they would definitely get where she wanted by tonight. Their destination was a well-known location to all of Tremborag’s Goblins, an area relatively uninhabited by Human settlements. For good reason. When Rags had heard of this place—a small village—she’d immediately wanted to see it for herself.</p>
<p>All of Tremborag’s former Goblins had objected, Poisonbite and Noears most stridently of all. But Rags had been adamant.</p>
<p>“Want to see.”</p>
<p>That was all she told them, and Rags overruled all the objections. But she was lying and she knew it. Rags just wanted to kill something today.</p>
<p>On the march, Rags summoned Noears and made him tell her and Pyrite all he could about the surrounding area. He was happy to do it and Rags found she liked how intelligent he was and the breadth of his knowledge.</p>
<p>“Learned much while acting stupid, Chieftain.”</p>
<p>He grinned at her and then pretended to be dumb, eyes losing focus, letting his mouth fall open as he drooled on himself. Pyrite grunted and grinned as he chewed on some frozen tree sap. Rags smiled despite her mood.</p>
<p>“Good. Other tribes?”</p>
<p>Noears nodded. He counted on his fingers, listing off several big Goblin tribes.</p>
<p>“Tremborag is biggest by far. But strong Chieftains live here.”</p>
<p>“Have to be strong. Or run or die.”</p>
<p>Pyrite added. Noears and Rags both nodded.</p>
<p>“Strong Chieftains. Not run. One—big Hob with tribe of many Hobs. Another—[Witch]. Knows fire magic. And a tribe with many thieves. Sneaks into places and steals…”</p>
<p>Rags listened, nodding appreciatively at the information. These tribes certainly were a cut above the ones around Liscor. She wondered if there were Goblin tribes in the south who were just as strong, besides the two she knew of. Had the Goblin Lord absorbed all of them into his army?</p>
<p>She was also curious about one of the Chieftains Noears had mentioned. A Chieftain who was also a [Witch]? Rags would love to meet her, but they were too far away. Going to visit their territory would mean a long journey, careful planning, scouting and fighting against monsters and Humans…and besides, after Tremborag, Rags was a bit tired of meeting new tribes.</p>
<p>That was how Rags occupied herself on the first part of the march. The second part as they crossed an open section of ground filled with untouched snow was devoted to fighting and avoiding monsters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Golem!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cry went up among the Goblins. Rags immediately kicked her Carn Wolf and shot forwards. She saw Redfang Warriors racing towards her waving their arms, at the same time she saw the Snow Golem.</p>
<p>It was…about the size of a hill. That was to say, it was around two hundred…two hundred and sixty feet high. And it was nearly as wide as it was tall. The massive abomination of snow <em>groaned</em>, the sound echoing for miles, the product of shifting tonnes of snow and dirt and rock.</p>
<p>Rags stared at the Snow Golem. It was no classic snowman built by Human kids anymore. It was more like a squat, vaguely pyramidal horror with long arms that scythed around aimlessly as it moved. Slowly.</p>
<p>It hadn’t noticed the Flooded Waters tribe yet. Rags immediately shouted and her Goblins changed course, moving perpendicular to the Snow Golem to keep well away from it.</p>
<p>Snow Golems. Goblins knew countless monsters thanks to their tribal memory and experience living in the wilderness. But Snow Golems were usually one of the few monsters Goblins didn’t fear. After all, a normal one wasn’t that big unless the kids that made it were really ambitious and all they could do was smack you with their twig arms.</p>
<p>True, they could hit you hard enough to draw blood, but they were just <em>snow.</em> Hardly a threat unless they smothered you. Of the Golem species, Snow Golems were weaker than Mud Golems or Sand Golems, which was…embarrassing, really.</p>
<p>It was only when they got this big that Snow Golems got less funny. In the Winter, Snow Golems could get very big very fast, and hill-sized ones like these were to be avoided at all costs. So long as you kept your distance though, you were still pretty safe. All a Snow Golem could do at range was hurl part of itself at you. That was a concern with such a huge one, but they had terrible aim.</p>
<p>Giant Snow Golems weren’t too dangerous…unless you happened to walk past one while it wasn’t moving. Then the Snow Golem would grab you and swallow you whole. The stones, shards of ice, and crushing pressure of the Golem’s body would grind you into paste quite quickly.</p>
<p>Oh, and cities, Rags supposed. If a Snow Golem found a city or village it would have to be slain quickly or lured away. Otherwise the city would be destroyed.</p>
<p>But all in all, it wasn’t a threat. Rags was just relaxing as the Snow Golem became a distant mound slowly moving on the horizon when she heard another call go up.</p>
<p>“Attack! Monster!”</p>
<p>It was Noears who delivered this report. Rags turned left and saw something coming at her tribe through the snow, leaving a geyser in its wake.</p>
<p>Yes, most monsters usually fled a huge force of Goblins. No lone Mothbear would attack a vast tribe, even if it was starving. But some monsters could prey on Goblin tribes, attacking fast and taking away their victims. Other monsters were just insane.</p>
<p>Which kind was this? Rags couldn’t see the monster amid the churning snow, but she shouted and the nearest group of warriors rushed forwards. They all had pikes she was glad to see, and they formed a wall, aimed at the approaching monster.</p>
<p>Rags waited, tense, astride her snarling wolf. More Goblins were rushing towards her, but they’d get here after the monster. She had to weather the first assault. And now, as the monster charged her Goblins, she saw what it was.</p>
<p>Half of a thing. At least, that’s what Rags thought. The creature was dark green, skin full of crags. It looked…like half of a body. The upper half.</p>
<p>Huge, terribly long and powerful arms with massive claws that dragged it forwards. A torso of some dark green hide armored with what looked like scales of metal. But no lower half. And no head. Rags saw a gaping mouth where the neck should be, but no eyes.</p>
<p>It was some kind of horror, some monstrosity. Rags felt her Goblins shudder, but she shouted at them to hold position. There was no time to load her crossbow—Rags pointed at the thing and cast [Firefly].</p>
<p>The flaming insect-bird burned as it struck the monster, but the searing heat seemed to do nothing to the monster’s thick hide. Rags pulled the gem of [Terror] from her belt and held it up. Only briefly—it would affect her Goblin warriors too. But though they shuddered as the effects struck them, the crawling thing only dragged itself forwards again, ignoring the magic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hold ground!</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Rags screamed it at her warriors, and then the crawling monster crashed into the rows of pikes. It didn’t slow, and it didn’t stop. Rags saw the wooden tips of the pikes breaking as they snapped under the monster’s charge.</p>
<p>But some stuck into the creature. It jerked as two rammed deep into it, drawing viscous green blood. But it still kept coming.</p>
<p>Goblins screamed and the formation broke as the pikes failed. The crawling thing snatched up five Goblins and pressed them against its oval mouth full of teeth. Rags saw the Goblins screaming, flailing—then only blood.</p>
<p>“<em>Chieftain!</em>”</p>
<p>Lightning struck the crawler as it dropped the remains and crawled towards Rags. She pulled her mount back as Noears ran forwards and zapped the crawler. It didn’t flinch as it kept coming.</p>
<p>“Redfang!”</p>
<p>Another cry. Redfang warriors on Carn Wolves sped forwards, slashing at the dark green hide of the crawler’s back, drawing blood. But their weapons failed to cut deep as well, and the crawler swung at them, knocking one Goblin off his wolf.</p>
<p>“Surround! More pikes! Get Hobs!”</p>
<p>Rags screamed at her Goblins, trying to organize them. She brought every pike she could to bear on the thing—giving her Goblins a chance to hurt it as it charged them. She had crossbows pelting it, but still the crawler kept charging into the ranks of her warriors, heedless of the horrible injuries it was taking.</p>
<p>In the end, her Hobs had to wade in and bash it to death. The one with the mace managed to break something in one of the arms, and the others held the second down while Pyrite and the strongest Hobs beat at the thing. It took a long time to die.</p>
<p>When it was over, Rags counted the dead. Thirty five Goblins had died, eight of them Redfang warriors. She felt disgusted at herself and angry at the thing—when Noears told her it was a good battle she nearly struck him.</p>
<p>“Killed too many!”</p>
<p>He just shrugged. He was sweaty from casting so many spells, but he looked better than her Hobs. All of them had taken wounds, especially the ones who’d had to hold down the thing’s good arm. Rags shouted at one to get a potion and the Hob gratefully went to get one from one of the wagons. She glared at Noears.</p>
<p>“What was?”</p>
<p>He shook his head as he stared at the dead green thing, lying in a puddle of its own gore in the stained snow.</p>
<p>“Crawler. Armored one.”</p>
<p>Rags eyed the dead monstrosity. None of the Goblins were willing to get near it, although a few with pikes kept poking it to make sure it wasn’t faking.</p>
<p>“What is?”</p>
<p>He didn’t know. Some kind of failed mage experiment maybe? Whatever the original had been, it had found a way to multiply over the years. It was just one monster among the ones around Invrisil, if a rare breed. The crawlers were suicidally aggressive. They’d attack anything edible, regardless of the danger. That they were still around was a testament to how hard they were to kill.</p>
<p>Rags stared at the dead Goblins, already going to a wagon to be chopped up later for food. She looked away.</p>
<p>She hadn’t participated in the battle. Oh, she’d organized her tribe, but Rags had only cast one spell. She’d had to lead, not fight. And her Goblins were dead because of it. It made Rags feel sick to her stomach, but she could only move on.</p>
<p>The Goblins left the crawler behind. None of them wanted to try eating it, and Rags wasn’t sure if it would be safe. She had the Goblins who’d gotten blood on them scrub the places clean with hot water, and then she marched on. They weren’t far from the village now.</p>
<p>It was late in the evening when Rags saw the village, a collection of rundown buildings in the snow, looking for all the world like an abandoned settlement.</p>
<p>She wasn’t fooled, though. As soon as she saw the village Rags immediately ordered all the non-warriors to pull back a few hundred feet with a good-sized detachment of warriors to guard them. The rest of her warriors she took with her.</p>
<p>To battle.</p>
<p>The Goblins who lived in this part of the continent shuddered as they approached. They knew what this place was. The other Goblins picked up on the mood, but Rags kept them going.</p>
<p>And as they approached the village, the keen eyes of the Goblins began to pick out the inhabitants. They villagers wandered among the ruins of their home, shambling, ignoring the freezing snow.</p>
<p>Zombies.</p>
<p>It seemed like the light was darker around this place, or maybe the sun was just setting more quickly. But this was a famous spot. A village of the dead. A place where the dead could not die.</p>
<p>Zombie villages weren’t unheard of. If a horde killed off an entire village, they could soon all become shambling undead creatures. But this one was…unique. Because these zombies didn’t move from this village. They guarded their former home in death as they had in life.</p>
<p>No one knew why. But though adventuring teams had been sent and monsters had clashed with the undead, no one had been able to raze the village once and for all. There were simply too many zombies. With each death, a new one rose to join their ranks so that this village was small, but Rags knew hundreds or more than a thousand zombies had to be hiding in the snow, or in the houses.</p>
<p>No one came here. There was too much death. Overwhelming death. That was the consensus among Goblins and Humans, it seemed. This village of the dead was a beehive waiting to be disturbed. And once it was, it would consume whomever was foolish enough to trespass here.</p>
<p>But Rags wanted a fight. She had her sword and buckler out and she was leading her Goblins herself—against her commander’s objections. Pyrite was walking next to her, axe on his shoulder. He’d only nodded when she said she wanted to test her forces against this village.</p>
<p>Rags called a halt as she saw the zombies take notice of her warriors. She began organizing them, putting pikes out front, having her crossbows move to the center while she pulled the wolf riders back for quick attacks. She was going to attack this army of the dead with her new formation and see how well it held up.</p>
<p>It felt wrong to make her Goblins fight after the crawling thing, but Rags had decided to do it anyways. The way they’d broken when it had gotten past the pikes proved that she needed to drill them, to make them into a unified fighting force.</p>
<p>The zombies came in a shambling mass. They didn’t run, but they moved faster than Rags would have liked. She eyed them, watching for the telltale sign of Ghouls or other undead stalking along the mass of zombies, but found none around the outskirts of the village.</p>
<p>More were rising from the snow. Rags looked at her Goblin warriors. She had a good box formation—a phalanx if Rags had known the word—going on. But she didn’t want to remain stationary.</p>
<p>“Pikes!”</p>
<p>They stiffened as Rags raised her voice. The Goblins warriors holding the pikes were not elites. They didn’t like being in front without Hobs, but Rags wanted to prove to them her new tactics <em>would</em> work. She shouted at them and they tensed, leveling their spears at the sea of dead bodies coming at them.</p>
<p>“Charge!”</p>
<p>Rags pointed her sword and the Goblins around her ran forwards, screaming in both fear and rage. She ran too.</p>
<p>The pike Goblins hit the zombies <em>hard.</em> Rags saw bodies being impaled on the spears, and those that survived ran into the Goblins in the formation with swords who hacked at them. Rags shouted, and the pikes fought for a few seconds before attempting to disengage.</p>
<p>It was hard. She ran forwards, cutting and found Pyrite and other Goblin warriors were at her side. They forced the zombies back and the Goblins ran, some abandoning their pikes despite Rags shouting.</p>
<p>Rags thrust her short sword into a zombie’s head and watched as it fell. But only seconds after it had fallen she saw it trying to get back up. She cursed. This wasn’t what she’d thought would happen at all!</p>
<p>This village of the dead refused to die. Zombies came back to life…in a manner of speaking. When killed, they would reattach their severed limbs, regenerate burned skin. Rags had heard it was possible to kill them by disintegrating them or chopping them up into really small bits, but it was hard to do that when countless more of them were attacking you.</p>
<p>She’d thought it would be a good group to test her warriors on. But these zombies came to back life <em>fast.</em> Rags burned the corpse with [Firefly] and shouted at her warriors to retreat.</p>
<p>They did so, the Hobs moving back last. They were far stronger than zombies and easily cut the dead apart. But they kept coming back.</p>
<p>This truly was a village that no one could use. Necromancers couldn’t control these strange zombies, and it was pointless to try and eradicate the bodies. They just kept reforming, making the dead villagers and victims over the years into a truly immortal force. And if it were just zombies it would be fine. However…</p>
<p>“Ghouls!”</p>
<p>Rags heard the cry go out. She looked over and saw Poisonbite shouting. Crossbows loosed and Rags saw darting shapes streaming out of the village stumbling, but more came on. She shouted and the Goblins around her started running in a true retreat.</p>
<p>“Chieftain!”</p>
<p>Rags heard Pyrite and turned to see a Ghoul leaping at her from the left. She cut at it and dodged it. The Ghoul landed, one arm dangling uselessly. Rags stabbed at it. She got it in the throat, but the Ghoul just impaled itself further on her blade as it rushed at her. Rags bashed it with her buckler, but the Ghoul cut her. It ripped at the leather armor on her stomach and Rags gasped as she felt something slice her belly. Then it struck her on the head and the world went dark.</p>
<p>“<em>Chieftain!</em>”</p>
<p>Something <em>shook</em> the ground around Rags. She stumbled, flailing with the buckler but the Ghoul was gone. Rags fell back. So. She couldn’t kill one Ghoul? She really was…</p>
<p>She felt someone pulling her back. Away…</p>
<p>When Rags woke up, her tribe was marching quickly. She sat up groggily, but it was dark. She realized they were marching away from the village and dropped her head back to whatever she was lying on.</p>
<p>Rags slept.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>When he was young, the Goblin King often caught the many varieties of insects in his jungle home. He would study each one he caught before eating them. Some were brightly colored beetles, others worms with wings, or biting insects made far too large. Many were poisonous and kept him sick. Others were actually tasty, or had beneficial effects. </em></p>
<p><em>The Goblin King learned which were good and taught his friends and tribe. So it was that he became a [Healer] long before he became a Chieftain of his tribe. And he never forgot, even when his [Healer] class was merged into his [Chieftain] class…</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rags sat up. She covered her aching head in her hands and then realized she was healed. She was healed—</p>
<p>And she was in camp. It was late at night, very late. Goblins were camped…where? Rags looked around.</p>
<p>They were sitting in the middle of the snowy plains. Far, a few miles away from the village. Far enough that Pyrite must have decided they were safe. He’d saved her.</p>
<p>Rags remembered what had happened in jolts as she struggled to her feet. She felt tired—weak. And ashamed.</p>
<p>“Chieftain.”</p>
<p>Someone came towards her. A huge shape. Pyrite. He saw Rags was up and immediately called out. A Goblin ran over with hot meat on a stick. Rags tore at it greedily as Pyrite led her to a fire where the ground had been cleared to sit.</p>
<p>Goblins were lying or sitting in small groups in the cold night. Many of them glanced up as Rags passed by and then looked down. She couldn’t meet their eyes and the food in her hands cooled as she lost her appetite.</p>
<p>“Eat. Sit.”</p>
<p>Pyrite sat Rags down. She found herself sitting at a small fire with the Hob and one other Goblin. Greybeard smiled at Rags as he chewed on some tough meat.</p>
<p>There was something in Rags’ eyes. It made her stare at the fire and it was in Pyrite’s gaze and Greybeard’s as well. Not reproach; that would have been easier.</p>
<p>“How many dead?”</p>
<p>That was all Rags asked. Pyrite thought.</p>
<p>“Less than a hundred.”</p>
<p>He didn’t lie, but Rags didn’t want to know how many less than a hundred really was. Ninety nine? She stared into the fire.</p>
<p>“My fault.”</p>
<p>None of the Goblins around her replied. They knew it was true. Rags had made a mistake. She’d taken her Goblins here to fight—because she’d wanted to fight. She’d wanted to prove she was a good warrior and a Chieftain. All she’d done was get Goblins killed.</p>
<p>“Chieftain wants to be a warrior. Is not one.”</p>
<p>Greybeard cackled and Pyrite poked him hard, making the older Goblin yelp. Rags said nothing. She bowed her head.</p>
<p>A bit of envy. A bit of frustration. She did want to be a better warrior than she was. She liked being a Chieftain, but it hadn’t been enough, had it? So she’d killed over a hundred Goblins today with her pride.</p>
<p>It was painful. And yet Rags still felt the same desire in her chest. The urge.</p>
<p>“Too weak. I am weak.”</p>
<p>She looked at Pyrite. He paused, and nodded.</p>
<p>“Best leader is smart. But strong is also good.”</p>
<p>“I must be strong.”</p>
<p>Greybeard nodded. Pyrite nodded. Rags knew the Goblins pretending to slumber around her agreed. A Chieftain could be cunning, but she had to be strong enough too. Strong with her head, strong with her body—Rags desired both.</p>
<p>“Tell me about the Goblin King.”</p>
<p>Rags said it suddenly. She looked at Greybeard and the old Goblin froze. Pyrite looked at Rags.</p>
<p>“Long time ago.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Long for a Goblin. But not for a Human. Many had been alive when the last Goblin King had, and Tremborag had fought with him. Surely this old Goblin knew the King. Rags remembered the Goblin King as a small Goblin, foraging in a jungle and was suddenly consumed by curiosity.</p>
<p>“Who was he? Why did he kill? What does it mean to be Goblin?”</p>
<p>The Goblins fell silent. What few that had been eating paused, and Rags knew that they weren’t pretending to look away. All eyes turned to Greybeard.</p>
<p>And he—lost his usual grin. He stopped eating and stared into the fire. And when he spoke, his voice was deeper. It wasn’t crackling and merry, but somber. Quiet.</p>
<p>“The Goblin King was a peaceful king for many years. Six years he ruled and we lived without fighting.”</p>
<p>Rags stared at him. She had never known that.</p>
<p>“Without?”</p>
<p>“Without.”</p>
<p>Greybeard tossed an unchewed bone into the fire and watched it <em>crack</em>.</p>
<p>“We made peace with the Humans, Gnolls, even Drakes. On this continent. On Baleros we forged alliances. While he lived, Goblins were only hunted in a few places, and most of us prospered.”</p>
<p><em>He only acted stupid. </em>Rags stared at the old Hobgoblin and looked at Pyrite. He looked at her, calm and unsurprised. He knew Greybeard was smart. How?</p>
<p>“You remember?”</p>
<p>Rags saw Greybeard turn. His face was caught by the dim firelight and she saw a younger Goblin there. How old did you have to be to have your hair turn white? He grinned at her, exposing his remaining yellow teeth.</p>
<p>“Know him? I saw him die. I was there. I remember the Goblin King, Velan. And as the Humans and other races named him: Velan the Kind. And I remember the King before that. Curulac of a Hundred Days.”</p>
<p>Silence. Perfect, so quiet you could hear the snow fall. No Goblin here had known the last Goblin King. And Rags had never known the one before him.</p>
<p>Curulac. Who had he been? The oldest memory she had experienced hadn’t hinted of him. She could only look back to the Goblin King’s youth now.</p>
<p>“What were they like?”</p>
<p>Greybeard paused. Then he pointed up and smiled.</p>
<p>“Like stars.”</p>
<p>Rags looked up at the night sky. She stared as some clouds shifted and the stars emerged. She understood. Distant, radiant things, untouchable. Unreachable.</p>
<p>“How can I become a better Chieftain?”</p>
<p>“Learn.”</p>
<p>That was all Graybeard said. Pyrite stared at Rags and shrugged. He fished the bone out of the fire, cooled it in some snow, and began to chew it to bits.</p>
<p>Rags got up and walked away from the fire. She walked around her camp once, twice. She checked on the wounded, but Pyrite had given potions to those that needed it. She watched the sun rise, and then found the Redfang warriors.</p>
<p>They were quiet too from last night’s battle. But few of them had died, and they were already beginning to train as the sun slowly rose. Rags stopped before Redscar with her buckler and sword. He was doing pushups. He paused, and then turned his head sideways as Rags got down on the ground and copied him.</p>
<p>“Chieftain. Bad form.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“Like this.”</p>
<p>He corrected her arms, made her place her hands wider, straighten her back. Rags grunted as she struggled to hold that position. She was fit, but not like he was. After a while her arms began to hurt, but she kept lowering herself to the ground and lifting herself up slowly.</p>
<p>“Good. Slow. Do twenty more.”</p>
<p>Redscar supervised her as Rags did more pushups, determined not to cry out. She knew other Redfang warriors were watching her. When she was done, she was sweating with exhaustion in the cold.</p>
<p>“What now?”</p>
<p>“Now—other exercises. Want to try?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Rags followed Redscar as he performed various stretches and moves which made her muscles burn. When he was done Rags felt as if she’d never been more tired. She hadn’t known just doing things like lifting her legs over her head could get so <em>tiring.</em></p>
<p>“Chieftain is not bad.”</p>
<p>Redscar grinned at Rags. He had a sword in his hand. She eyed it as she sat up.</p>
<p>“What now?”</p>
<p>“Now? Sparring unless moving.”</p>
<p>Rags made a face. She hated sparring. She’d done it with Garen and leveled up, but only a bit. She pointed at the other Redfang warriors. They were locking blades, letting each other parry blows, strike at each other. When they were actually intending to hit each other they used dull, wood weapons.</p>
<p>“Does it work?”</p>
<p>“Works. You will level.”</p>
<p>“Haven’t much.”</p>
<p>Rags caught a tossed practice sword and hopped back as Redscar slashed at her. She held her buckler up and jabbed at him, keeping him away. He slid forwards and nearly broke her guard with a heavy blow.</p>
<p>“Garen Redfang only beat you up. Training means winning too.”</p>
<p>Pyrite and Greybeard found Rags training with another Redfang warrior as the rest of the Goblins finished packing up the camp. Rags was exhausted. She’d lost to Redscar every time they’d sparred, but won twice against some of the weaker Redfang warriors.</p>
<p>Greybeard cackled as he saw Rags bash a Redfang warrior in the head and then poke him hard in the gut with her wooden sword.</p>
<p>“Hah! Chieftain is strong! For Goblin.”</p>
<p>“Not for Hob.”</p>
<p>“True.”</p>
<p>Redscar watched approvingly from the side. He and the other Redfang warriors had observed Rags’ progress and she felt they were more accepting of her than they had been. She wasn’t nearly as good as they were, but she had kept up with them.</p>
<p>“Will train every day?”</p>
<p>Pyrite glanced at one of the Redfang Hobs who was dueling four Goblins at once. Rags nodded. She saw Poisonbite and Noears had come by as well. Poisonbite was watching some of the male Redfang warriors who’d stripped down to almost nothing with interest. Noears was watching the female ones with interest.</p>
<p>“Will train. Pyrite, you will too. All warriors will.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Chieftain.”</p>
<p>Rags nodded appreciatively at him, but Poisonbite scowled. She folded her arms, looking unhappy at the idea of that kind of exercise.</p>
<p>“Goblins do not train.”</p>
<p>Rubbing her sore arms, Rags eyed her. Poisonbite was one of the typical Goblin warriors. She liked fighting, but didn’t like practicing fighting. You either fought or rested. She answered the female Goblin shortly.</p>
<p>“My Goblins will.”</p>
<p>“Is it Goblin?”</p>
<p>The challenge came as Rags was picking up her short sword. Rags whirled, fury in her eyes. It wasn’t a direct attack, but it was as close as any Goblin had come. Poisonbite flinched a bit, but she didn’t back down from Rags.</p>
<p>“It is Goblin. Goblins must be strong.”</p>
<p>“Training is not Goblin.”</p>
<p>Poisonbite didn’t quite dare meet Rags’ eyes. Rags hissed. Why were Goblins like Poisonbite so <em>small? S</em>o…?</p>
<p>She had her sword in one hand. Rags longed to raise it, but someone hurried in front of her. Greybeard. He had a bowl of soup in his hands and cackled at her in that deceptive tone of his.</p>
<p>“No angry, Chieftain. Calm, yes. Eat food. Is tasty. Eat.”</p>
<p>She stared at him. Two innocent eyes stared back. Greybeard was pretending to be…senile again. With a noise of disgust Rags seized the bowl. She found she did feel better after a few mouthfuls of food, but she still eyed Poisonbite angrily.</p>
<p>“Did the Goblin Kings do that?”</p>
<p>“Do what, Chieftain?”</p>
<p>Greybeard stared at Rags innocently. She stared back.</p>
<p>“Did they do it? Train?”</p>
<p>“If they did, it was Goblin.”</p>
<p>It was a non-answer. Rags made a noise of disgust and hurled the empty bowl at Greybeard. He caught it and cackled.</p>
<p>“Training is good! Makes Goblins strong! If Chieftain says so, is it not Goblin?”</p>
<p>“It is good. And it will make Goblins live.”</p>
<p>That was all Rags said. She stared at Poisonbite—the other Goblins refused to meet her eyes. But Noears calmly nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes Chieftain.”</p>
<p>That would have to do. Rags nodded. But Redscar intercepted her as she went back for a second helping of food.</p>
<p>“Chieftain. Where now?”</p>
<p>Rags stared at him blankly. Then she remembered. They were camped out here, with provisions depleting with each meal. What should they do now?</p>
<p>She only had a vague idea. Rags hesitated, then pointed south.</p>
<p>“Go home. Fight Goblin Lord. Make base.”</p>
<p>Redscar nodded.</p>
<p>“Old Redfang base? Good. Defensive.”</p>
<p>“Maybe.”</p>
<p>Rags pondered. She was more concerned about the immediate march.</p>
<p>“Must hunt. Get food. Also—Humans.”</p>
<p>The Goblin bared his teeth, making the scar on his face twist.</p>
<p>“Lots of Humans, Chieftain. To kill?”</p>
<p>Rags hesitated. That certainly seemed to be their only choice. But…</p>
<p>Too weak. Rags felt the same pang in her chest. How could she lead her tribe when she couldn’t be fighting in the front? No—how could she order them to fight Human adventurers, who might kill hundreds of them?</p>
<p>She was not Tremborag. But she was a Chieftain now. She had the class. Rags felt it. The thing she’d felt since waking yesterday.</p>
<p>Pressure. And a bit of fear that she wasn’t good enough.</p>
<p>But she was Chieftain. Rags squared her shoulder and stood tall. She looked down at Redscar, though he was physically taller than she was. But Rags stood ten feet tall. She was a Chieftain. And inspiration flickered in her mind as she stared across her vast tribe, thousands strong now.</p>
<p>“We will go south. And Humans? I will beat them all.”</p>
<p>“You, Chieftain? How?”</p>
<p>“With head. Not arm.”</p>
<p>Redscar stared at her. Then, he smiled.</p>
<p>“Good. That is why we follow you.”</p>
<p>Rags grinned in reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a large adventuring group that found the Furgather Tribe in their home. Over forty Bronze-rank adventurers and six Silver-rank adventurers attacked the tribe’s camp at midday. They slew the Chieftain and fought the Hobs with overwhelming numbers while the others held the Goblins at bay.</p>
<p>They had come to wipe out the tribe. The Goblins were pressed up against a cliff wall, unable to escape. Old Goblins and children fled the adventurers with blades, who cut down all Goblins without distinction. If some hesitated when they saw the infants, well, they were new. The Silver-rank ones had taken more than one extermination request.</p>
<p>The Furgather tribe wasn’t a strong one. They had preyed on villages, stolen rather than killed. They were weak, the weakest of monsters in a place where only the strong survived. Now, the remaining Goblins cried out as they formed an ever-shrinking core, trying to defend their friends and families.</p>
<p>They cried out for someone to save them, knowing that no one would come. Knowing there were no gods, and certainly none for Goblins. But someone did hear them.</p>
<p>A wolf howled. The adventurers heard the sound and some turned to look. They saw a wolf sitting on a distant hill. One of the adventurers with [Keen Eyes] cried out and pointed.</p>
<p>“Mounted Goblin!”</p>
<p>There was indeed a Goblin mounted on the back of the Carn Wolf. She had a crossbow in her hands and she was aiming it at the adventurers. Instantly, they turned—ten Bronze rank adventurers keeping the remaining Furgather Goblins pinned while the rest spread out. Where there was one Goblin, they knew there would be more.</p>
<p>But they were not prepared for the army that came over the hill. Goblins, a huge mass of them, flooded over the hill. Not just any wild Goblins either; the adventurers saw a row of pikes forming a wall aimed at them, while the rest took positions behind them.</p>
<p>Thousands of Goblins. Some sat on the backs of huge red wolves, others were the dreaded Hob variants, tall as any Human and far stronger than most. And the Goblins standing on the hill all had crossbows trained on the adventurers.</p>
<p>They had height, numbers, and everything else on their side. The adventurers froze with fear. They saw huge Hobs, a match for any Silver-rank adventurer, among the Goblins’ number.</p>
<p>They were going to die.</p>
<p>But the Goblins didn’t attack. They held position, waiting. And then the Goblin the adventurers had first seen rode slowly towards the tribe. She was small. Young. But she was their Chieftain.</p>
<p>And she saw what the adventurers had done. The Goblin looked at the dead bodies of the Furgather tribe’s warriors and sighed. Then she looked at the adventurers. There was something cold in her eyes. But all she said to them were two things.</p>
<p>“Drop weapons.”</p>
<p>The adventurers stared at her. Rags pointed at one of them—a Silver-rank [Ranger] with a bow.</p>
<p>“Drop. Or die.”</p>
<p>She hesitated. The other adventurers waited for her cue. Did they fight and surely die, or surrender and…? They knew what Goblins did to women.</p>
<p>The [Ranger] chose to fight. She swung her bow up, but lightning struck her and eight arrows struck her before she could draw the arrow in her bow. She fell, and the other adventurers cried out—eight arrows had struck the [Ranger], but stray shots had landed among them.</p>
<p>“Surrender.”</p>
<p>That was all the small Goblin said. The adventurers threw down their weapons, realizing they had no chance. The Furgather Goblins rushed forwards, crying out with rage, but the Goblin on the wolf shouted something at them in their own language.</p>
<p>It was a strange group of forty nearly naked adventurers who ran from the place where the Furgather Goblins had lived. Their armor was gone, as were their weapons. But they were alive, which was more than could be said for many of the Furgather tribe. They sat, mourning their dead as some were made into food.</p>
<p>Rags found the one of the Goblins who might be in charge. He stared up at her, afraid of her Carn Wolf and her strange tribe. She nodded to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I am Rags. Flooded Waters Chieftain.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He gabbled his thanks at her. Rags cut him off. She pointed at his tribe.</p>
<p>“Can rebuild. Or follow.”</p>
<p>Then she turned and rode away. Her tribe followed. The Furgather Goblin stared at her back for a second, and then called out. His Goblins followed Rags’ tribe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An hour later, a large caravan moved down the road, headed towards the city of Ostegrast. It was a large caravan as they went. Over thirty laden wagons rumbled down the road, protected by a force of nearly a hundred [Guards] and [Mercenaries]. Around these lands, there was safety in such numbers. The [Traders] and [Merchants] in the convoy sat comfortably on their mounts, secure in the knowledge that few monsters would dare attack them.</p>
<p>But then they heard the drumbeats. At first, it was just an odd sound that made some of the Humans pick at their ears, wondering if they were hearing things. But then they heard the sound grow louder, and knew it was no illusion.</p>
<p>“An army?”</p>
<p>The [Merchant] in charge of the caravan rode up beside the [Mercenary Captain], a tall man who used a broadsword and shield. The man frowned as he looked towards the horizon.</p>
<p>“I haven’t heard of one. And they wouldn’t be beating the drums. There’s no war going on!”</p>
<p>“Then what—”</p>
<p>The question went unasked. The drums suddenly grew louder, and more sounded from the opposite direction of the caravan. It slowed as all of those riding had a terrible premonition.</p>
<p>“Can we get off the road?”</p>
<p>“Too late.”</p>
<p>The mercenary drew his sword and shouted orders. The caravan moved into a circular formation and the guards spread out to guard their charges. And all the while the heavy beats grew louder and louder.</p>
<p>The drums thundered. They sounded more like crashing metal than a conventional drum. The rhythmic thumping went through the bones of the Humans who stared around in fear.</p>
<p>Then they saw the Goblins. Hundreds of them. Thousands. They seemed to appear from nowhere out of the snow. And indeed—some of them were sitting up and brushing snow off of their bodies. They had been lying there, waiting for the caravan.</p>
<p>It was a trap! The [Guards] closed ranks around the frightened [Merchants] and [Traders]. They held their weapons up as an act of defiance more than anything else; against so many Goblins and surrounded as they were, there was no hope of survival.</p>
<p>A Goblin rode forwards. Rags had the gem of [Terror] in one hand, but she didn’t want to use it. She wanted those horses and the cargo—intact.</p>
<p>The Humans were waiting for death, but they weren’t prepared for the Goblins on the other side of the road to part ranks. They stared at the opening formed and at Rags with suspicion and fear.</p>
<p>“Leave wagons. Run. Live.”</p>
<p>Rags grinned at them, her black crossbow resting on her Carn Wolf’s head, much to the beast’s annoyance. The Humans hesitated.</p>
<p>Goblins? Acting like bandits? It was unheard of. Goblins would rather just slaughter all of them, surely. But this Goblin was giving them a way out.</p>
<p>The mercenary captain was first to move. He cautiously called out, and his soldiers shuffled towards the gap. The [Merchants] and [Traders] shouted at them to stay, but no one in the convoy was going to die for nothing. Soon, all the Humans were standing away from the wagons. They stared at Rags, as if afraid she was going to order her Goblins to attack now.</p>
<p>“We can leave? You swear it?”</p>
<p>One of the Humans called out uncertainly. Rags rolled her eyes she waved her hands.</p>
<p>“Shoo. Go away.”</p>
<p>She gestured, and the Humans slowly backed away towards freedom. Only when they were past the last Goblins and dared to race away on their horses did Rags signal her Goblins to move in.</p>
<p>The cargo was full of food and other goods, a bountiful shipment meant to keep the Human city well supplied and make the [Merchants] and [Traders] rich. Rags grinned as she and Pyrite inspected the boxes.</p>
<p>“Lots of horses.”</p>
<p>She liked horses. They were good at pulling things and tasty, too. Pyrite was also smiling. There was some dried jerky in the crates that he was already testing.</p>
<p>“Do again?”</p>
<p>Rags nodded. She figured she had one day before word got out. Goblins raiding the roads was bad for business, and surely an army would be sent to destroy them. But by that point she’d be going south, to war with the Goblin Lord.</p>
<p>And perhaps…perhaps the army sent would be slower than most. Because Rags had only killed five Humans today. Only the ones who would rather die than give up their goods or throw down their weapons.</p>
<p>It wasn’t perfect, but it was her plan. Goblins could be like bandits, who were more like people than Goblins. And she could win battles with her head and without losing a single Goblin, which was better than them dying.</p>
<p>She smiled at Pyrite. He chewed some jerky and offered her some. She waved it away.</p>
<p>“Is this good Chieftain thing?”</p>
<p>He shrugged.</p>
<p>“Scare the Humans. Good plan. Is fun.”</p>
<p>Rags nodded. She stared towards the sky. It was daytime, so the stars weren’t visible. But she wondered if the Goblin King had been like this. Once upon a time. Had he wondered if what he was doing was right? Had he made so many bad mistakes?</p>
<p>She didn’t know. Rags could only trust herself. So she called out and her Goblins cleared the road. They could raid one more caravan. Then they’d be heading south. Towards Liscor. Towards war and death, Rags knew. But also to a small inn she’d missed. And an innkeeper that Rags wanted to speak with, to talk with. To ask her questions and hear her reply.</p>
<p>South.</p>
<p>Back home.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The stone halls were dark at night in Wistram. True, the mage-lights provided decent illumination, but the magics that controlled them dimmed the intensity of light that each floating orb of light or eternally burning torch gave off.</p>
<p>Many mages didn’t care to wander outside of the thick walls that made up the citadel that was Wistram academy. Thus, this change in ambient light was the only clue some had that it was time to sleep. In parts of the citadel where there were no windows, mages could wander for hours without ever seeing the sun.</p>
<p>“I hear it’s dimensional magic. Very complex stuff. I wonder how big Wistram really is. Has anyone ever tried to measure it from the inside and compared it to the outside?”</p>
<p>“Shut up!”</p>
<p>Most mages preferred to walk the halls at night with orbs created by the [Light] spell. However, the two new students who crept from shadow to shadow used no magic now. They were trying to be quiet.</p>
<p>And failing.</p>
<p>“I’m just saying, who created this place? It had to be an [Archmage], but how many additions were made over the years?”</p>
<p>“Pisces, for the love of <em>leaves</em>, shut up!”</p>
<p>The half-Elf in front snapped at the young man creeping along behind her. Pisces closed his mouth, and she prayed he’d keep quiet.</p>
<p>“Are you sure we’re going the right way? I thought we should have gone left back there.”</p>
<p>Ceria <em>hissed</em> with annoyance and straightened up. She paused in the shadows between two globes of light and looked around to make sure no one was walking down the corridors.</p>
<p>There wasn’t anyone. They were safe. Mages did like to stay up at odd hours, it was true, but this wasn’t a particularly well-travelled part of the academy in the day. Most students up this late would be drinking or having a party elsewhere. As for the mages, they’d be studying books, or doing the same thing as the students.</p>
<p>Still, Ceria lowered her voice as she spoke to Pisces.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to be stealthy here, don’t you get it? And the oval library with the staircase is this way, I’m sure of it!”</p>
<p>Pisces frowned, but Ceria knew her sense of direction was better than his. Wistram was confusing, but she’d gotten used to wandering around forests where every tree looked like the last one.</p>
<p>To his credit, Pisces kept his voice low, but he still kept chattering. Both he and she were nervous, and so he kept talking while she led them onwards.</p>
<p>“I don’t see why we’re hiding. It’s not as if we’re doing anything wrong.”</p>
<p>“We’re going to steal a book from other students. And we’re going to one of the restricted libraries to do it!”</p>
<p>“Well…it’s not their book.”</p>
<p>Ceria knew what she was doing might well get them kicked out of Wistram. But she was sick of sticking to the rules. She’d had to deal with Rievan, the rude, arrogant Human teacher who seemed to hate half-Elves, and Illphres, who had refused to teach them magic. She hated Wistram’s stupid secrets and the way everything was give and take around here.</p>
<p>And she was afraid she would fail the exam that was only a couple of weeks away. So Ceria had decided to break the rules and help Pisces steal the magical spellbook.</p>
<p>“They didn’t <em>expressly</em> forbid us from entering this section of the academy.”</p>
<p>Ceria frowned at Pisces.</p>
<p>“They told us this place was off-limits!”</p>
<p>“Ah. Yes. Well, I believe that may have been a warning rather than an inviolable rule. From all we’ve seen, I surmise that these restrictions are meant to test how we react to such impositions, not actually stop all of us.”</p>
<p>“What? Stop using complex words!”</p>
<p>Pisces paused. He chewed at his lip and rephrased his statement.</p>
<p>“We can break the rules—if we’re not caught. They’re expecting us to.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Right.”</p>
<p>Ceria thought about that and nodded.</p>
<p>“Makes sense. Okay, let’s get in there. Why couldn’t you have just said that from the start? You always use too many complicated words!”</p>
<p>“But I <em>like </em>complicated words.”</p>
<p>Pisces muttered as he and Ceria snuck down the empty side-corridor. She knew he was right, at least in a sense. It didn’t seem like Wistram had many totally absolute rules. But still, she had to point out a flaw in his reasoning.</p>
<p>“The problem isn’t whether we’ll be caught by other mages and get punished. It’s whether anyone sees us and sells someone else the secret that we were sneaking about right before a spellbook got stolen.”</p>
<p>“Ah yes. Secrets. That would be problematic.”</p>
<p>Behind Ceria, Pisces grimaced. Here in Wistram everyone’s actions and words were carefully noted by people around them, to be used and traded like currency. Secrets were the lifeblood of the mages here, and it meant their presence in this part of the academy would be noted by anyone they met.</p>
<p>Ceria peeked around an intersection and then moved down it when she saw no one was there. She glanced up at a painting on the wall—some relief showing a bunch of adventurers battling a Goblin Lord. That meant they were close.</p>
<p>“You’re sure the other students aren’t going to try and grab the book tonight?”</p>
<p>“They said they were going to talk to another mage who specialized in dispelling wards. I think we’re safe. The magic killed or nearly killed one of their friends. I don’t think they’ll be too eager to try again without preparation.”</p>
<p>Ceria stopped. She turned to look at Pisces. He was nervous, but his pale face also looked excited. She was less sanguine.</p>
<p>“One of them got <em>killed? </em>Are you sure this plan of yours will work?”</p>
<p>He hesitated.</p>
<p>“Fairly. I believe there will be no risk to either one of us, even if it fails. The only thing we have to fear is being seen.”</p>
<p>The half-Elf shook her head.</p>
<p>“I wish you’d explain.”</p>
<p>“Too many ears back in the banquet hall. And I’m still not sure the older students don’t place eavesdropping spells in the hallways. I can tell you now if you want, but it’s faster this way.”</p>
<p>“Tell me later, then. We’re close.”</p>
<p>The two moved onwards. Ceria knew her footsteps were almost inaudible, but Pisces shuffled around a bit in his cheap robes. Still, she didn’t expect anyone but another half-Elf or a species with good hearing to pick up on the faint sounds.</p>
<p>“How did you know what they were saying, anyways? Do <em>you</em> know a listening spell?”</p>
<p>She had to ask. Pisces hesitated. When he spoke quietly, his voice seemed uncertain.</p>
<p>“Something…similar. Suffice it to say I heard every word they spoke. Now…is this it?”</p>
<p>They’d reached a pair of double doors, set right next to a diagonal intersection of three corridors. Ceria stared at the doors and then at the way the wall ended a few feet ahead of the doors. Architecture and the laws of space didn’t seem to matter in this place.</p>
<p>“This is it. Keep an eye out and make sure no one’s coming.”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded and looked around while Ceria put her ear to the door. She knew the room beyond the doors was large, but she listened hard for any sounds of people moving about. After a minute she’d still heard not a sound. Satisfied the room was probably empty, Ceria opened the door and she and Pisces slipped inside.</p>
<p>The oval library with the staircase was one of a multitude of libraries in Wistram. Most contained books, as befitted libraries, but some were dedicated to one subject, or all comprised of books from a certain era. One library had a pool of water in it, and all the books were waterproofed to let mages read and bathe.</p>
<p>Wistram was very odd. But this library was fairly normal, as libraries went. The room was indeed ovoid, and a central staircase led up to four walkways around the room where shelves of books sat side by side.</p>
<p>Ceria had never seen so many books before coming here. This place alone easily held a fortune in old, sometimes cracking books of dust and ink. She coughed and Pisces sneezed as they walked into the room.</p>
<p>“Rot. Golems haven’t dusted in here for a while.”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded. Eyes watering he sniffed and pointed.</p>
<p>“Too many…books. Ah, but look. You can see someone’s been here.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Ceria could see places where the dust had been disturbed. She and Pisces made their way up the staircase, following the cleared areas and found themselves on the second level, staring at a wall of books.</p>
<p>“Is there some kind of mechanism here? Some activated spell?”</p>
<p>“I think so. But let me see…hey, these are all real books!”</p>
<p>Pisces pulled a few tomes out of the shelves. Ceria stared at them. It looked like this entire shelf was dedicated to Human history. She spied different genealogies, historical accounts, and personal bibliographies, all from Human kingdoms she’d never heard of before. She frowned at Pisces as he flipped open a book and stared at the writing inside.</p>
<p>“They’re real, yes. So what?”</p>
<p>“Well, apparently if you do this—”</p>
<p>Pisces pulled one of the books from the shelves and switched it with another book higher up. The instant the two books had been pushed into place, the entire bookshelf suddenly <em>faded.</em> Ceria gasped, and Pieces whistled quietly.</p>
<p>“Truly impressive. They’re books that were all spelled with the same enchantment.”</p>
<p>He waved a hand, letting it pass straight through the bookshelf. Ceria stared through the intangible books. There was a tunnel in the wall, one that leads straight into another room.</p>
<p>“A second library?”</p>
<p>“Yes. That’s where we’ll find the spellbook.”</p>
<p>The two students stepped into the secret tunnel cautiously. Ceria gasped as she looked around the circular room occupied by a shelf full of books, and of all things, a bed and dresser! There was a small table and mirror which were both covered with dust.</p>
<p>Pisces sneezed and raised a small cloud of dust, and Ceria coughed and wiped at her eyes.</p>
<p>“Dead gods. Is this some secret bedroom?”</p>
<p>“Looks like it.”</p>
<p>“Who’d make a secret passageway into a <em>library</em> of all places?”</p>
<p>“Someone who values their privacy?”</p>
<p>Pisces sidled away as Ceria kicked at him.</p>
<p>“Or someone who likes books. Or…”</p>
<p>“Or?”</p>
<p>He nodded towards the passageway that led back to the main part of the library.</p>
<p>“Or perhaps this library was ideal for whomever lived here. Most of the books seem to be largely historical in this section. Few people would bother to peruse the stacks. So whoever lived here might have constructed this hiding place in a time when the mages of Wistram were less…amiable towards each other than they are now.”</p>
<p>Ceria shivered at that thought. She imagined mages fighting each other, sneaking about in hidden passages like this.</p>
<p>“You’ve got a twisted imagination Pisces, you know that, right?”</p>
<p>He shrugged self-consciously.</p>
<p>“I prefer to think of myself as pragmatic. Now…my plan should be working as we speak. We just need to find the book.”</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t be too hard.”</p>
<p>Ceria walked over to the bookshelf.</p>
<p>“Ah—don’t touch any of them!”</p>
<p>Pisces cautioned Ceria as she reached for a book. She snatched her hand back.</p>
<p>“What? I thought the books were spelled against opening.”</p>
<p>All the spellbooks she’d heard of were warded against being read, but Pisces shook his head.</p>
<p>“The one we’re after apparently killed the student who tried to take it out. And we cannot be sure the other ones aren’t trapped in the same way.”</p>
<p>“Dead <em>gods.</em> Who’s so paranoid they’d use a spell like that?”</p>
<p>Ceria groused as she and Pisces studied the books on the shelf at a respectful distance. It wasn’t too hard, just difficult to see the covers with all the dust clinging to the books. Pisces suggested blowing it away with a spell, and after that it was much easier.</p>
<p>“I’m assuming this is a personal spellbook, right?”</p>
<p>“Correct. There should be no title on the spine. And if we use [Detect Magic]…aha! These two books seem to be the most powerful.”</p>
<p>Pisces pointed to two of the tomes. One was thick and it looked to Ceria’s untrained eye like the spell on it wasn’t that powerful. She guessed it was just a valuable book of some kind, warded against tearing or decay. But the other book shone in her vision, not brightly, but with an intensity that made it seem <em>realer</em> than the other books in the room.</p>
<p>“That’s the one. I’m sure of it.”</p>
<p>“I think so too. Now, what was your big plan? Pry it out with something? A pair of sticks, maybe?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be silly. The spell might activate! No, we just have to wait—”</p>
<p>“Hold it!”</p>
<p>Ceria held up one hand, suddenly alarmed. Her ears twitched and she put a finger to her lips. Pisces went still and Ceria crept back towards the entrance of the tunnel. She whispered to Pisces.</p>
<p>“I hear footsteps.”</p>
<p>They must have been loud, for her to hear them. Ceria held her breath as she realized someone was definitely coming towards this very library. She looked at Pisces, suddenly worried.</p>
<p>“The students?”</p>
<p>“No—I think it might be someone else. If it’s who I think it is—”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>Pisces opened his mouth, but the door opened before he could tell Ceria. She flinched back into the tunnel, realizing too late that they’d left the transparent bookshelf! Anyone would be able to see something was odd in an instant.</p>
<p>But the being that walked through the doorway was no mage, and certainly no student come to take the spellbook. A tall, inhumanly perfect woman made of grey stone seemed to glide through the doorway. She was eight feet tall and the stone clothing she wore rippled as she walked, as if she was alive.</p>
<p>Cognita turned and stared around the room. Her eyes found Ceria, hiding behind the transparent bookshelf at once. The half-Elf jumped and shuddered, but Cognita just strode towards her with the same look of calm on her face as always.</p>
<p>“Ceria Springwalker. I hope you are having a good night?”</p>
<p>“What? Um, yes. Yes, I am. Cognita. Uh—”</p>
<p>Ceria stammered and took a step back as the Truestone Golem stopped in front of her. She was enormous. Ceria had no idea why she was here, but Pisces stepped forwards and Cognita’s head nodded fractionally.</p>
<p>“I have just received your note, student Pisces. May I ask what is the matter?”</p>
<p>The young man coughed and stood a bit straighter as Ceria’s head turned from him to Cognita rapidly.</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you Miss Cognita. I was hoping you could help me retrieve a book, you see. It’s warded with some kind of spell, but I would like to study it to advance my grasp of spellcraft.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Cognita’s face changed slightly as she stared down at Pisces. Ceria saw something shift in the Golem’s usually impassive features. Was it curiosity? Then the eyes shifted to Ceria and the half-Elf felt a jolt in her stomach.</p>
<p>“I assume your friend is here for the same reason?”</p>
<p>“Ceria? Yes, she’s just here for ah, moral support. The book is this way. If you would…”</p>
<p>Pisces gestured, and Cognita stepped forwards. He smiled up at her, letting the tall Golem bow her head to enter the tunnel. He would have followed, but Ceria pulled him back and hissed at him.</p>
<p>“You called <em>Cognita?</em> That was your plan?”</p>
<p>Pisces looked blankly at her.</p>
<p>“What’s the problem with that?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>Ceria spluttered, unable to explain. How could she convey the unease she felt when she looked at Cognita, or rather, felt the Golem’s eyes on her?</p>
<p>The eyes of the Truestone Golem had been sculpted to perfectly mimic the eyes of a Human woman. But they were not alive. They moved as if they were, though, and Ceria knew there was some intelligence controlling the thing that called herself Cognita. But it was not the same as living and it scared Ceria.</p>
<p>She knew other students in Wistram felt the same or more strongly. Some mages avoided Cognita in the hallways. Ceria could get along with the Golem because she was helpful and acted quite normally, but she didn’t like Cognita’s eyes.</p>
<p>Pisces however acted as though Cognita was no different than Ceria. He walked after her as the Golem studied the shelves and looked around the room.</p>
<p>“You see Cognita, we ah, happened to learn about this room you see, and I note that its previous occupant is probably long since deceased…”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Cognita nodded once and looked back at the two students.</p>
<p>“This is the residence of Nemistra Verdinan, a Selphid who lived here for many years in hiding. She is long dead, but it is good to see her room has finally been discovered. I will have other Golems collect the lost books and return them to their proper locations.”</p>
<p>Both mages blinked up at Cognita, caught off-guard by the matter-of-fact response. Pisces coughed.</p>
<p>“Yes, well, I am, ah, glad. But could I trouble you to ask whether taking her former spellbook would be permissible? It’s the one on the second shelf from the bottom you see—”</p>
<p>“Yes. I see it.”</p>
<p>Cognita studied the tome, eyes unblinking. Ceria and Pisces held their breaths. When the Truestone Golem turned, she nodded again.</p>
<p>“The tome is guarded by several wards that would melt the flesh of anyone attempting to retrieve it. I can remove it without issue to myself, following which the wards would be broken.”</p>
<p>“Excellent!”</p>
<p>Pisces rubbed his hands together happily, but Ceria was uneasy.</p>
<p>“So you’ll just give us the book? Really?”</p>
<p>Cognita paused.</p>
<p>“That is acceptable. However, Wistram law now dictates that mages below the third year only be allowed one personal spellbook for their use. You have already been issued one. If I give you this book, you must return your spellbook.”</p>
<p>Ceria groaned. Of course. There <em>had</em> to be a catch. But Pisces was undeterred.</p>
<p>“Very well, Miss Cognita. I would happily trade in my spellbook for this one. Would you ah, like me to retrieve it before…?”</p>
<p>“No need.”</p>
<p>The Truestone Golem turned, and the stone woman calmly pulled the book out of the bookcase. Ceria held her breath, expecting something dramatic to happen. But all she saw was a slight ripple in the air as Cognita pulled the book out—then she calmly turned and held it out to Pisces.</p>
<p>He was reluctant to take it. Pisces’ hands trembled a bit as he reached for the book, and Ceria saw him visibly brace himself. But when he gingerly grasped the book and Cognita let go, nothing happened to him either. He nearly dropped the book in surprise.</p>
<p>“The wards have been broken. It is safe to read.”</p>
<p>“Many thanks!”</p>
<p>Pisces stared delightedly at the spellbook in his hands. He beamed at Cognita.</p>
<p>“I cannot thank you enough. Please, accept my profuse gratitude for your help rendered in—”</p>
<p>Ceria kicked Pisces in the shins. He yelped, but she just smiled at Cognita.</p>
<p>“Um, thank you Cognita. This was a big help. We couldn’t have gotten the spellbook alone.”</p>
<p>“No. You could not.”</p>
<p>Cognita’s eyes found Ceria’s, and the half-Elf saw only cold marble there. But there was something in Cognita’s tone that suggested the Golem understood what she’d done. And she’d done it anyways, knowing it would help Ceria and Pisces.</p>
<p>“Most mages would not have turned to me for help. Your decision to do so is interesting.”</p>
<p>Ceria had no idea what to make of <em>that.</em> She cleared her throat nervously.</p>
<p>“Um, well, Cognita, about this. We’d prefer to keep this secret—would you mind not telling anyone you helped us?”</p>
<p>Both she and Pisces held their breaths as the Golem pondered for a moment. Cognita shook her head.</p>
<p>“I care little for squabbles between mages. I am bound to be truthful, so I shall be. Thus, I shall relate all I have seen here.”</p>
<p>Ceria closed her eyes and Pisces groaned aloud. Cognita continued calmly.</p>
<p>“If I am asked about these specific events, I will share what I have seen. But only then. I suspect your secret will be safe, young mages.”</p>
<p>She nodded at Ceria and Pisces. The half-Elf and young man saw the Golem’s lips curve upwards slightly, and then the Golem turned.</p>
<p>“I must be going. I have other duties. I am pleased to have been of assistance to the two of you tonight. Sleep well.”</p>
<p>She walked away quickly, leaving Ceria and Pisces at a loss for words. They stared at her back, and then jumped as the Golem closed the double doors with a <em>click.</em> Ceria immediately began hurrying towards the doors, but Pisces called her back.</p>
<p>“Wait! We’ve got to cover our tracks! Let’s get this bookshelf back the way it was.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“I think we just replace the two books in their original positions.”</p>
<p>Sure enough, the instant the two books were in the right spot, the bookshelf became real again. Ceria and Pisces pressed on the books and shelf, but it refused to budge.</p>
<p>“Impressive magic.”</p>
<p>“Admire it later! Let’s go before someone sees us!”</p>
<p>The two hurried out of the library, closing the door securely and moving quickly back towards their rooms. On the way, Ceria questioned Pisces, who was trying to walk and stare at the pages of the spellbook at the same time.</p>
<p>“That was—did you <em>know</em> Cognita could do that?”</p>
<p>“I had an inkling after she shattered that ice wall. If she can break Illphres’ enchantments, why not the trap spells on a book? And it seemed easy enough to ask her for help. After all, the Golems of Wistram are bound to help the students, are they not?”</p>
<p>Ceria had to agree with that, although she would have never considered the idea. She doubted the older students would have either. She frowned as she led Pisces down a passage and flight of steps.</p>
<p>“How did you send Cognita a note?”</p>
<p>“Secret.”</p>
<p>He grinned at Ceria impishly. She glared at him and he raised his hands.</p>
<p>“Really, it is a secret Ceria. I…it’s rather complicated. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>She frowned, but let the matter drop. Soon, they were back in Pisces’ room and only then did Pisces open the spellbook on his table and let Ceria peer at it.</p>
<p>“Dead gods. Look at all the spells!”</p>
<p>Pisces had a wild grin on his face as he and Ceria flipped through page after page of uneven handwriting. Whoever had written the book had done it in a foreign language, but the nature of the magic spells was something any mage could decode with enough effort.</p>
<p>“I can’t understand what that spell does. Do you see…?”</p>
<p>“No. But I’m sure it will come in time. And look! This is clearly some kind of flame-based spell. Can’t you tell from the way it’s formed here?”</p>
<p>“You’re right!”</p>
<p>Ceria was giddy with excitement. They had a spellbook! A real spellbook, not one filled with useless spells! Her excitement faded a bit as she realized it really wasn’t <em>her</em> spellbook, though.</p>
<p>“I guess you’ll be able to learn a lot, huh?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Pisces turned to Ceria in surprise. He held the book to her.</p>
<p>“This was a joint effort, Ceria. This book is as much yours as it is mine. We can take turns reading it—”</p>
<p>“No, it’s yours. You didn’t need me at all! You could have done all of this by yourself!”</p>
<p>Pisces shook his head, offering the book to Ceria as she backed away.</p>
<p>“Not true. Your expertise in subversion and stealth were quite essential. And the addition of another pair of eyes and another mind to cross-check my conclusions were invaluable.”</p>
<p>“What does that—”</p>
<p>“Look, we worked on it together. And I want you to study it as well. If we can learn some spells from this, we might stand a good chance of passing the exams at the end of the month! This is an opportunity for both of us, Ceria.”</p>
<p>Slowly, it began to dawn on Ceria that Pisces had intended to share the book with her the instant he’d figured out how to take it. She looked at him awkwardly, not sure what to say.</p>
<p>He was a Human, but he was genuine and clearly wanted to help her pass. She smiled at him, and Pisces grinned back in delight.</p>
<p>“Well—okay. We can study together. Two arrows are better than one. But it’s your book, okay? After all, you’re going to have to give Cognita your other spellbook.”</p>
<p>“True. I’d better pretend I lost the other one.”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded at Ceria. But then he smiled widely again, overcome with delight.</p>
<p>“Let’s see how many spells we can identify! I’m sure there’s at least one Tier 4 spell in here!”</p>
<p>The two got back to poring over the book. Ceria squinted at the magical writing, guessing some of the spells with Pisces.</p>
<p>“Hey. Isn’t that…[Stone Fist]? That’s a good Tier 3 spell!”</p>
<p>“Really? I thought it was Tier 2?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s Tier 3. You see, when you use it you create this rock armor around your hand.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that really heavy?”</p>
<p>“You’d think so, but I saw a [Druid] using it once. He cracked a boulder like it was nothing!”</p>
<p>“I bet we could learn that in time for the exam. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“Maybe. But look here. This is some kind of movement spell, I’m positive of it! Can you see what the nature of it is?”</p>
<p>Ceria bent forwards to look at the spell Pisces had pointed to. In doing so, she realized that she was sitting in a room in the middle of the night. With a young Human man.</p>
<p>A few years ago—she would have put an arrow in Pisces’ head, or run away. But now she was sitting next to him as if it was the most natural thing in the world. Ceria paused.</p>
<p>He was a good person, albeit a bit clumsy and wordy. But she liked him, and thought of him as a friend already. In fact, she quite liked him. Ceria had no idea how she felt about that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day, Ceria had trouble keeping her eyes open in all of her classes. She was exhausted from staying up and trying to puzzle out the spells in Pisces’ book. She nearly fell asleep twice in her class studying basic enchantments and how to decode magical auras, but she didn’t dare close her eyes in Rievan’s class.</p>
<p>“I trust you’ve all memorized the lessons from yesterday?”</p>
<p>He stared around the classroom, staring at each student in turn. When he met Ceria’s eyes Rievan’s nose wrinkled slightly and he looked past her. He pointed.</p>
<p>“You there. Pisces. Where is your spellbook?”</p>
<p>Pisces jerked upright, blinking rapidly.</p>
<p>“My spellbook?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Where are your notes?”</p>
<p>Pisces folded his fingers together as Ceria tried not to stare at him.</p>
<p>“I lost my spellbook, sir. But I can recall my notes from last class quite well.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>One of Rievan’s narrow eyebrows rose as he glared at Pisces.</p>
<p>“Then you will surely be able to recall my statement regarding the dangers of overabundance of mana in the system? Repeat my words back to me.”</p>
<p>Ceria winced, but Pisces just cleared his throat, looking quite calm.</p>
<p>“Mana, sir, may over accumulate in any living being’s body as a result of a spell or influx of mana in a charged environment, but more often than not it is a result of imbibing a mana potion improperly. For a mage, casting any spell will usually resolve the issue, but for those without mana, time and rest are the only usual solutions. A competent mage may attempt to drain the excess magic from a person, but this action is not without risk. And in high concentration, excess mana may well lead to rupturing of blood vessels or parts of the body overloading or shutting down.”</p>
<p>Ceria and the other students in the room gaped as Pisces delivered a perfect summary of Rievan’s lesson from yesterday. The [Mage] stared hard at Pisces as the young man finished and sat down.</p>
<p>“Very…good.”</p>
<p>He said it grudgingly, and turned away from Pisces without another word.</p>
<p>“We will continue our lessons from yesterday! Clear your desks and begin forming your spells again. I want to see more attention to detail, Springwalker! And you—Elkrin, is it? Your control of your [Fire Orb] spell is abysmal! Focus your flames or don’t bother to cast the spell at all!”</p>
<p>The lesson ended without incident, which was to say Ceria ended up being scolded for her lackluster performance. But she was more concerned with Pisces. After it was over, she walked down the corridor with him.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you memorized all of that!”</p>
<p>“I paid attention in class, and I have a good memory.”</p>
<p>Pisces scratched at his hair self-consciously as they entered the banquet hall. Ceria saw Calvaron and Beatrice at their usual spot and waved to them. She got her food and made her way over. She and Pisces had to pause as an older man carrying a tray nearly ran them over. He grunted and without a word of apology went to sit at an empty table.</p>
<p>“Stupid Human. I nearly dropped my plate!”</p>
<p>Ceria grouched as she sat down. She’d taken some pork chops roasted in a sauce that smelled like peanuts today. Pisces had a more balanced meal; he’d taken one of the pork chops and several sweet red fruits that tempted Ceria. He stared after the man, frowning.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that poor Elkrin? He seems upset.”</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t he be? You two were in Rievan’s class just now, weren’t you?”</p>
<p>Calvaron laughed and cleared part of their table so Pisces could put his food down. He and Beatrice were nearly finished their meal—some kind of small, round pasta-like food drizzled with a thick sauce and accompanied by steamed vegetables.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Rievan tore a strip off of Elkrin for his spellcasting.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded as she began to cut her meat apart. She still felt grouchy from having to deal with Rievan. She paused and narrowed her eyes at Calvaron.</p>
<p>“Wait a second. Isn’t that a secret I should be charging you for?”</p>
<p>He laughed and slapped at the lower, horse half of his body.</p>
<p>“Not <em>everything </em>is a secret, Ceria. Something as normal as that is just juicy gossip. But it looks like Elkrin’s not taking the dressing down well, is it?”</p>
<p>Ceria half-turned in her padded seat to look. Elkrin did have a murderous scowl on his face and no one was sitting with him. Calvaron shook his head as he <em>tsked</em>.</p>
<p>“Attitude problem. He may be a good adventurer, but you have to be willing to learn if you want to stay here. I bet he’ll be gone within the week.”</p>
<p>Pisces and Ceria exchanged a glance at this. They could understand not liking Rievan, but leaving because of that? Wistram was their dream.</p>
<p>Calvaron noticed the look.</p>
<p>“Only a few people actually quit, but they’re usually only adventurers. Some of them—even the good ones like the Gold-rank adventurers who come here to improve their craft—they don’t like being told the magic they practice is inefficient. So they leave.”</p>
<p>“Stupid. Arrogant.”</p>
<p>Beatrice put that in. The Dullahan was spoon-feeding her head on the table as usual, and she seemed content to let Calvaron do all the talking. Ceria had to agree with her, but she yawned as she opened her mouth. That made Pisces yawn too.</p>
<p>“Oho! You two look tired! Did you keep each other up at night, or is it just a coincidence?”</p>
<p>Calvaron dodged the rolled-up napkin Ceria hurled at him. He twisted his fingers and the ball of cloth flew back at her, forcing Ceria to duck or let it smack her in the head.</p>
<p>“Don’t throw things unless you can catch them when they come right back at you, Springwalker. Telekinesis and levitation spells come later in the year though, I’m afraid.”</p>
<p>“Great. I’ll be sure to heave my plate at you when your back is turned, then.”</p>
<p>Ceria growled as she picked her napkin up from the floor. Calvaron just laughed again. He was already ready to smile, which made Ceria wonder if all Centaurs were so good-natured. Beatrice on the other hand was as prone to smile as a rock.</p>
<p>“How were your other classes? Did you like learning about enchantments? I always found that class dull, myself.”</p>
<p>Ceria shrugged and Pisces smiled.</p>
<p>“Our teacher—Fedric—is fairly good at saying as little as he needs to.”</p>
<p>“Fedric? Oh, he would be. Dullahans are like that, aren’t they, Beatrice?”</p>
<p>Calvaron nudged Beatrice’s body, and her head on the table scowled at him.</p>
<p>“I say what I have to. I don’t run my mouth, Calvaron.”</p>
<p>“I’m surprised to see so many Dullahans in Wistram. No offense, but I’d barely heard of your people before coming here.”</p>
<p>Ceria looked at Beatrice with interest. Fedric, their teacher for their class on enchantments, was an old male Dullahan. She’d seen a number of them in the corridors as well.</p>
<p>Beatrice just shrugged her shoulders as she swiveled her head to talk to Ceria.</p>
<p>“Not too many. But all good spellcasters get sent here from Baleros. One continent means lots of Dullahan applicants.”</p>
<p>“True enough.”</p>
<p>Calvaron nodded. He pointed across the banquet hall, and Ceria saw a group of six Centaurs walking down the hall. They were far bigger than most students, and so they had to walk single-file to get in line.</p>
<p>“My people don’t usually go in for spellcasting, but like Beatrice said, the best come here and there are a lot of us on Baleros. That’s why you’ll see quite a few species that are rare in most places. Selphids, for instance.”</p>
<p>Ceria and Beatrice shuddered a bit at the mention of that race. Ceria had seen the deathly-white students walking the halls, dead bodies controlled by their parasitic owners. Calvaron shrugged stoically.</p>
<p>“They’re not so bad when you get used to them. I know they get a bad rap back home, but the ones here are all very polite.”</p>
<p>“Wistram truly does have more species than I’ve ever seen before.”</p>
<p>Pisces wiped at his mouth with a napkin. Calvaron grinned.</p>
<p>“We’re way more diverse than most cities, it’s true. Anyone who can become a mage or learn a magical class is welcome here—if they’ve got talent and coin. Of course, not all races are as gifted as others. That’s why you won’t see many Minotaurs, although I’ve heard they can make good mages. But most Minotaurs don’t like to use magic, so they’re not inclined to study here anyways.”</p>
<p>“And I bet some species aren’t as numerous or trusting of Wistram.”</p>
<p>Ceria said that thoughtfully as she chewed on some cow’s tongue she’d found under one of her pork chops. Calvaron grimaced and looked away as he replied—he hated to eat identifiable body parts, although he was surprisingly unconcerned about eating cows. Ceria had wondered if he would have been bothered by meat, but apparently Centaurs were far enough away from cows to eat them without guilt. She wondered how they felt about horses.</p>
<p>“You mean half-Elves, Ceria?”</p>
<p>She shrugged. She’d seen a few half-Elves roaming the halls, but they were far from common. She’d been tempted to talk with them, but it wasn’t as if she was back on Terandria and she had to stick with her own kind. Plus, she was a new student and she wasn’t sure if she’d make it past the exams.</p>
<p>“I know my people are naturally good at magic. But…I can’t say I’m surprised there aren’t many around. We’re not exactly welcome to strangers.”</p>
<p>“You and the Gnolls. You know, of all the species in the world, the only race who won’t set foot on Wistram are the Gnolls?”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Both Pisces and Ceria frowned at Calvaron. Ceria tried to think of a Gnoll, but only had a vague image of a furry dog-like person, similar to one of the Beastkin tribes from Baleros. She’d never seen one in person before; she heard they lived on Izril and seldom ventured as far as Terandria.</p>
<p>The Centaur nodded, frowning a bit as he explained.</p>
<p>“It’s a real pain too, apparently. A lot of Gnolls are famous [Merchants] and [Traders], you know. They’re pretty resilient and their tribes like to move about exchanging goods. But none of them will do any kind of business with Wistram, even through middlemen. It’s some kind of grudge, although I’ve never heard what it was about.”</p>
<p>“Really? A Gnoll grudge? I hear they keep those for lifetimes.”</p>
<p>“Too right. It’s a shame too, because I’d bet their tribes would benefit from having a few of their number learn magic. But…”</p>
<p>Calvaron shrugged. Beatrice raised her head so she could get everyone’s attention.</p>
<p>“A Gnoll did come here to study once, though. About a decade or two ago.”</p>
<p>“A Gnoll? You’re pulling my hoof, Beatrice.”</p>
<p>“Nope. He came but dropped out before his first year was up.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>The Centaur leaned towards Beatrice, but the Dullahan closed her lips in a slight smile.</p>
<p>“Secret. Pay me and I’ll tell.”</p>
<p>Everyone chortled at that. Calvaron was fairly rich in secrets Ceria had learned, and many students and mages came to him to exchange tidbits for goods and services. But Beatrice had her own collection of secrets, as any longtime mage in Wistram did.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if it’s worth a juicy secret. Would you consider a trade for something else? How about other goods and services rendered…?”</p>
<p>Calvaron wiggled his eyebrows at Beatrice and she smiled a bit wider.</p>
<p>“Not worth my time.”</p>
<p>“Ah, you!”</p>
<p>They liked each other. It was quite obvious from the way they flirted. Calvaron did it openly, Beatrice with deadpan remarks that might be serious or a joke; you could never tell which.</p>
<p>“Looks like you’d better cough up a secret if you want to know, Calvaron. Me and Pisces don’t have enough to cover the costs.”</p>
<p>“I’ll pass. You don’t collect as many secrets as I do by spending them frivolously.”</p>
<p>Calvaron waved a hand. Pisces looked intrigued and leaned forwards over the table.</p>
<p>“Just how many secrets <em>have</em> you obtained during your stay here, Calvaron?”</p>
<p>“That’s a secret in itself, my dear Pisces. But suffice it to say, I’ve got more than one person’s little tidbits locked away in my head.”</p>
<p>The Centaur tapped his head importantly. Pisces looked impressed as he nodded, but Ceria thought the Centaur was full of it. She raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>“You mean, you’re a secret keeper? Ooh. <em>Fancy.</em>”</p>
<p>Pisces snorted. Across the table, Beatrice choked on her food. She had to place her head on the table while the rest of her body pounded on her chest. Ceria and Pisces nearly fell over themselves laughing as Beatrice’s face contorted and Calvaron had to reach over and slap her on the back a few times. When she was done, the Dullahan turned her head with her hands so she could glare at the two.</p>
<p>“Not that funny.”</p>
<p>“It was pretty funny. No one calls people like me secret keepers or—or shadow brokers or anything like that, Ceria. I’m just a broker, a middleman. Or middle-Centaur if you like. It doesn’t roll off the tongue as smoothly. I buy and sell.”</p>
<p>“And make a good profit, I’ll bet. You’re rich!”</p>
<p>“Wistram rich, my dear half-Elf. It’s not the same as being actually rich. If I left this small isle no one would know my name. Here I have a bit of power.”</p>
<p>“Which explains why you maintain your independent status. Any faction in the academy can treat with you without fear you’ll trade their secrets away. It’s a valuable position to be in.”</p>
<p>Pisces observed that as he glanced carefully at Calvaron. The Centaur’s eyes focused on Pisces and he gave the younger man a nod of respect.</p>
<p>“Sharp, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“He hides it well. Tell us more about these factions, Calvaron. How did they pop up?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. It’s a long story…”</p>
<p>Calvaron glanced at one of the windows that let bright sunlight into the room. Ceria knew this was just theatrics; the Centaur had very few classes she understood, and he liked to lounge around in the banquet hall with Beatrice.</p>
<p>“Come on, you’ve got time and we don’t have classes for the rest of the day. Give us new students a bit of history.”</p>
<p>The Centaur grinned as he popped another grape into his mouth.</p>
<p>“What, for free? This isn’t just gossip. Some of this stuff is important. I can’t just give it away! You know how it works. Secrets for secrets.”</p>
<p>Pisces and Ceria both groaned at the same time. Ceria was going to tell Calvaron she didn’t want to know that bad when Pisces raised a finger.</p>
<p>“Would a small one do?”</p>
<p>“For general history? I suppose.”</p>
<p>Calvaron’s eyes sharpened, and the Centaur leaned forwards. Ceria saw Beatrice’s hands move; the Dullahan’s head whispered something and Ceria felt magic around the four of them. Some other students looked around, but most seemed used to what was going on.</p>
<p>It was an exchange of secrets. Calvaron and Pisces spoke to each other, but Ceria only saw a blur around their mouths and heard nothing. The Centaur had pulled a small crystal out of a belt pouch; it glowed bright red as Pisces spoke. The Centaur nodded, and in the next moment the bubble of silence dissipated.</p>
<p>“Well, I’d say that qualifies. How did you find out?”</p>
<p>Pisces smiled enigmatically at the Centaur.</p>
<p>“Secrets for secrets. To learn my method, you’d have to pay quite a lot, my dear Calvaron.”</p>
<p>“I suppose I deserved that.”</p>
<p>Ceria was dying to know what Pisces had told Calvaron—it could be just pointless information, but how had Pisces found out? She knew she wouldn’t get an answer from the Centaur though, so she pointed at the gem that the Centaur was putting back into the pouch at his waist.</p>
<p>“Is your truth crystal broken? It glowed red when Pisces spoke.”</p>
<p>He shook his head, grinning.</p>
<p>“Nope. It’s a little trick. Most truth spells glow green or blue or white when someone tells the truth, right? I’ve enchanted mine to do the opposite. Sometimes you can throw someone off with it.”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded as if this was perfectly sensible, but Ceria just rolled her eyes again.</p>
<p>“Everything in Wistram seems like a trick or mind game.”</p>
<p>“That’s just because you’re new. You’ll get used to it quick enough. Now, I believe I owe you some history?”</p>
<p>All four students took the moment to refill their plates. Ceria took some cold cubes of ice and splashed them into a sweet drink of fruit, delighted at the luxury of it. She sipped at her drink as Calvaron began speaking.</p>
<p>“I suppose you know Wistram has been around for thousands of years. It was founded oh, way back, when a lot of nations were at war and mages wanted a place to learn and teach in peace. Well, Wistram may have gained and lost power over the years, but it’s always been independent. No nation controls us—we have an army of our own here and only a truly grand fleet could make it to our shores with weather spells raised against them.”</p>
<p>“Not to mention Wistram provides many services.”</p>
<p>Beatrice put that in. Calvaron nodded proudly.</p>
<p>“We do provide the best spells and mages. You can trust a Wistram-certified enchantment. And we can enchant weaponry and other artifacts as well. We do a booming trade with adventurers who want better gear or to have something analyzed—”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. Wistram is great. That’s why we came here.”</p>
<p>Ceria cut in, impatient to get to the good part.</p>
<p>“What does this all have to do with factions? From what I’ve heard, they didn’t always exist.”</p>
<p>“No, Miss Busy half-Elf, they didn’t. And if you’d let me explain, you’d know that a few centuries ago, mages competed in Wistram quite fiercely. It was every mage for himself and they formed their own groups—but there was no faction. Instead, powerful mages attracted people to them. One of them was Archmage Zelkyr. Mind you, he wasn’t just an Archmage, but an <em>actual</em> [Archmage].”</p>
<p>“He obtained the class?”</p>
<p>Pisces’ eyes were shining, and Ceria scooted forwards on her seat. Calvaron nodded, looking just as excited by the idea.</p>
<p>“It’s a matter of history. The class <em>does</em> exist, and he and the other [Archmages] who ruled Wistram at the time all had them. But Archmage Zelkyr was the best. He was a Drake – famous, you know, for being able to damage one of the Walled Cities’ walls. But he was more famous for his ability to create Golems.”</p>
<p>“Cognita.”</p>
<p>Beatrice said it quietly. Calvaron nodded.</p>
<p>“Her and an entire army of Golems. They eventually made it so that Zelkyr was in undisputed control of Wistram. He alone explored the higher reaches of the citadel, searching for ancient magics left behind by the greatest mages in Wistram’s history.”</p>
<p>“Higher up? You mean, there’s places not yet explored in Wistram?”</p>
<p>Calvaron nodded as if it were obvious.</p>
<p>“Of course. How many mages do you think lived in Wistram? The greatest of them—legends who could cast countless magics—all settled the highest floors. If you go exploring higher and higher you’ll run across their creations, spells, and maybe their rooms. But imagine the amount of traps and dangerous spells up there! Just trying to break into a former mage’s room is deadly.”</p>
<p>“But Zelkyr had the monopoly on that, right?”</p>
<p>Ceria was beginning to understand what had happened, and why the upper floors were off limits now.</p>
<p>“He did indeed. Zelkyr ordered his Golems to guard the entrances to the upper levels and seal it off so only he could learn from the mages above. Of course, the other mages didn’t accept that and there was a huge battle. But in the end his surviving Truestone Construct—Cognita—imposed a new order on the surviving mages. They could live and study in Wistram, but the upper levels were for Zelkyr and the few he trusted alone.”</p>
<p>“Hence their current inaccessible state?”</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>Calvaron pointed a finger at Pisces as he stole a grape from Beatrice’s plate. She jabbed him with a gauntleted finger.</p>
<p>“<em>Gah!</em> Damn it Beatrice, it <em>hurts</em> when you do that!”</p>
<p>“Then don’t steal. Yes, Pisces, the upper levels are closed. The top three are only off limits for new mages, but after that—there is a door. Cognita and many golems guard it. It leads further up.”</p>
<p>“Okay, but why hasn’t anyone gotten Cognita to open it? Zelkyr is dead, right?”</p>
<p>“I’m getting to that! Hold on!”</p>
<p>Calvaron took a long drink, enjoying making Ceria and Pisces wait.</p>
<p>“One day, Cognita came down from the upper floors and announced that Archmage Zelkyr was dead. Ever since then, she and the other Golems have been maintaining Wistram. They still fulfill his orders by helping us, taking care of the academy, fighting off intruders and so forth, but his other order still stands. No one may venture above. So while Wistram is safe—”</p>
<p>“The higher magics are off-limits?”</p>
<p>Pisces looked dismayed at the thought. Calvaron waggled a finger at him.</p>
<p>“Just the ones that belonged to the greats. There’s plenty of mages here capable of casting Tier 5 spells, or even Tier 6. But higher than that…? You’ll have to get past Cognita first, and that’s pretty much impossible. If you challenge her, you’ll be fighting her and Zelkyr’s best creations.”</p>
<p>Beatrice’s armor shuddered a bit and she turned the corners of her mouth down.</p>
<p>“Golems. Scary.”</p>
<p>Ceria thought that was ironic coming from a Dullahan, but she had to admit that for all Beatrice was a disembodied head and a body covered in light metal armor, she was clearly alive. Cognita and the other Golems were not. There was an important distinction there.</p>
<p>“So Cognita’s not just a nice, friendly Golem?”</p>
<p>Calvaron snorted.</p>
<p>“She’s as nice as a Golem can be, which is sort of. But try to get past the door and…you’re dead. No one’s gotten past her since Zelkyr died.”</p>
<p>“And so far no one’s tried?”</p>
<p>“And so far no one’s <em>survived.</em>”</p>
<p>Beatrice said it quietly. Calvaron nodded soberly.</p>
<p>“Of course, countless mages challenged Cognita and the Golems in the past. Some did it by themselves, others attacked in groups or tried to catch the Golems off-guard. None succeeded. The Golems are powerful, and Cognita’s the strongest of them all. I’ve never seen her fight personally, mind, but there are other guardian Golems that Zelkyr made. Occasionally some group of mages decides to challenge them, but they’re always killed.”</p>
<p>Both Ceria and Pisces shuddered. Beatrice looked between them and shook her head with her hands.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. So long as you never try to get past the door, you’ll be fine. And there are other places below the door that are still unexplored.”</p>
<p>“Like below. There’s plenty of passages unexplored there, although we do have a problem with the undead. There are a lot of bones stored in the catacombs and they sometimes reanimate people who get killed down there.”</p>
<p>“Lovely. And…wait, how does this have anything to do with <em>factions?</em>”</p>
<p>“I’m <em>getting </em>to that. You’re the most impatient half-Elf I know, Ceria.”</p>
<p>“I’m the only one who’ll put up with a Centaur like you, Calvaron.”</p>
<p>“Hah! True. Anyways, the factions in Wistram popped up because there’s no one mage who’s powerful enough to really control everyone like there used to be. Now our Archmages are just the greatest mages among us, not those with the actual class. And factions are just mages with similar ideals.”</p>
<p>“Like the Revivalists. My faction. You two should join if you pass the exam.”</p>
<p>Beatrice smiled at Pisces and Ceria. Calvaron rolled his eyes and tipped her head over.</p>
<p>“Stop that, Beatrice! Ignore her, you two. You don’t want to get wrapped up in factional politics before your exam. That could really hurt your chances to get in.”</p>
<p>“Why? Surely if we pledge to one faction, they could help us succeed?”</p>
<p>Pisces seemed curious. Beatrice took the moment to respond—she’d cast a spell that made all the hairs on Calvaron’s horse-half stand up, which the yelping Centaur was having to dispel.</p>
<p>“They might. But other factions don’t like giving one strength. So it’s a bad idea. Sorry.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Calvaron gasped as he managed to remove Beatrice’s shocking hex. He glared at her, but she gave him a satisfied look and he decided not to escalate the situation.</p>
<p>“You won’t have to deal with them too much. Just know that some mages belong to a group with certain ideals. They differ in how they agree of course, but they stick together when it comes to voting or pushing their agendas. Illphres, for example. Remember her?”</p>
<p>Ceria ground her teeth together. She was still sore about not being taught any combat magic all this time she’d studied here.</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“Well, she’s an Isolationist. Thinks we should only allow mages who are already strong to join and that we should be reaching for greater heights in magic. That’s why she didn’t want to teach you.”</p>
<p>“Can’t the other factions force her to teach?”</p>
<p>“They can…but Illphres is stubborn and it’s not worth the battle. They’ll use her not teaching to their advantage instead; the others will be able to say the Isolationists don’t contribute their fair share and be able to vote against them. So Illphres is harming her own faction, but she’s too influential for anyone to stand up to her.”</p>
<p>“And meanwhile <em>we</em> suffer for it.”</p>
<p>Ceria angrily stabbed her cold pork, but Calvaron just shrugged.</p>
<p>“It’s bad luck I’m afraid. Sorry. But there are other factions in Wistram you should know about. Your good friend Rievan, for instance, belongs to the Libertarian group. They want us to start taking sides with different nations and throwing our influence around.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like a bad idea.”</p>
<p>“Don’t let any of the Libertarians catch you saying that. A lot of them are from Terandria, and they take a deep interest in the politics from there.”</p>
<p>“So factions are something else we’ll have to worry about?”</p>
<p>Ceria didn’t like the thought of that, but Calvaron just chuckled.</p>
<p>“Not for a while, and certainly not until you pass your exam. And if you get strong enough, you might be able to deal with factions on your own. The more important you are, the less your connections and factions matter. Then it’s just about who you are as a [Mage].”</p>
<p>“But it sounds like unless I’m a powerful mage, I’ll <em>need</em> to join a faction or be in danger.”</p>
<p>Ceria pointed that out and Pisces nodded in agreement. Calvaron paused before shaking his head.</p>
<p>“Not necessarily. You see, the factions keep each other in check so that the independents like me can function. How can I explain it? Okay, let’s say someone—a certain angry Elementalist teacher for instance—wanted to harass you. Because he doesn’t like your ears.”</p>
<p>“He <em>doesn’t</em> like me because of my ears.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but he’s not actively trying to harm you or get in your way, is he? That’s because if he did start attacking you, the Revivalists and the Preservationists would be all over him. They don’t want him to alienate your people—or spread the rumor that Wistram is a speciesist institution.”</p>
<p>“Preservationists? That’s a long name, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“They chose it, not us. Anyways, Mister Angry Elementalist would have to have a lot of support from his faction to get at you. He’d also have to consider your friends, and how much the other factions would retaliate if he went at you. Mind you, you’re hanging out with second and third-year students who aren’t powerful. Beatrice is a [Runeshaper] and I’m just a generalist [Mage], so we don’t have much clout.”</p>
<p>“You study runes, Beatrice? You never said.”</p>
<p>Beatrice nodded. She tapped at her armor where Ceria now saw some carved symbols etched into the metal.</p>
<p>“Working on some personal enchantments. Rune magic is very popular among Dullahans. But not powerful in faction.”</p>
<p>“Right. But don’t worry—Rievan’s not going to try anything. It would be too much trouble if he did and you’re not worth it.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>“Hey, it’s just politics. Like how you got stuck with Rievan and Illphres anyways. That was due to a squabble with the factions.”</p>
<p>“Really? Would you mind explaining how that happened?”</p>
<p>Pisces was interested, although Ceria wasn’t. Calvaron shrugged.</p>
<p>“You really want to know?”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“I don’t.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll tell Pisces and you can just eat your dead pig, Ceria. Now, the current mages teaching are mostly mages who like doing it. Some mages earn their keep and just live here by teaching. It’s not going to make them influential, but it is necessary and so they keep doing it. But a year ago, Tshya, the old Drake who taught me and Beatrice, died.”</p>
<p>“Poor Tshya.”</p>
<p>“He had scale rot. Very nasty odor. He never cleaned himself right near the end.”</p>
<p>“Calvaron!”</p>
<p>“Well, he didn’t! Remember the smell? And he was old. But he was in charge of a lot of lessons, and so the council wanted another of the oldest and most inactive mages to take on the job. Unfortunately, that would have meant choosing Belfore—he’s a Preservationist, just like Yim, the other teacher who was taking on a lot of classes. But that would have meant that the Preservationists were essentially doing all the teaching, and they didn’t want to let that happen in case it became precedent. So they <em>insisted</em> that the teaching be taken up by mages from all factions, which led to, among others, Rievan getting tapped for the job.”</p>
<p>“He’s not that important. So he got the job.”</p>
<p>“I see. But what about Illphres? You said she was important?”</p>
<p>“Yes, well, the Centrists—they’re the ones who want us to make every mage in the world part of Wistram and declare ourselves a nation—they’re always fighting with the Isolationists. And they really don’t like Illphres, so they nominated her. And she’s got a lot of enemies so they passed the vote and made her take the classes.”</p>
<p>Beatrice smiled.</p>
<p>“Simple, right?”</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>Ceria clutched at her head while Pisces nodded and kept asking more questions. Ceria went off to get dessert—a lovely bread with sugar baked into the crust and glazed with honey. Mages ate well at Wistram, but this was a treat. She returned to the table and suffered through more discussions of politics. Pisces looked hurt when she suggested they leave.</p>
<p>“You don’t find this interesting? There’s so much <em>depth</em> here!”</p>
<p>“Depth is for people who want it. I came here for magic, not politics.”</p>
<p>Ceria groused. But she had one thought. She turned to Calvaron and Beatrice.</p>
<p>“What about Amerys? Does she belong to any faction?”</p>
<p>The two older students blinked at her. Calvaron slowly shook his head.</p>
<p>“Amerys? Some factions wouldn’t have her simply for what she’s done. Others might, but Amerys has never approached anyone. The mage of the King of Destruction’s Seven stands alone.”</p>
<p>“She has friends.”</p>
<p>“More enemies than friends by a long shot. No, Amerys is alone, for all she’s an Archmage. I’d walk clear of her if I were you. No one forces her to do anything. And she’s unpredictable at best.”</p>
<p>“Like when she went out to fight the Sea Serpent. That was a surprise.”</p>
<p>“Not really. You know she likes battle, Beatrice.”</p>
<p>“I thought she did it to gain favor with the Revivalists, or maybe the Centrists.”</p>
<p>“Her? Hah! Never. Now, I can see one of the other Archmages doing that. Old Verdan Blackwood for instance could have taken down the Sea Serpent, but Amerys volunteered. Do you know what happened after that? Pisces, you’re not going to believe this…”</p>
<p>Somehow, it was dinner time before the conversation ended. Ceria and Pisces loaded up their plates with more food and chatted with Calvaron and Beatrice for another hour until Ceria decided they really did need to get back to their rooms to study.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe we talked for six hours!”</p>
<p>Ceria exclaimed out loud as she and Pisces headed back to their rooms. He only smiled, looking as happy as she’d ever seen him.</p>
<p>“It’s wonderful isn’t it? This place is such a haven of learning. I feel like I’m right at home when I have discussions like these.”</p>
<p>“More like a place to get fat. I ate too much.”</p>
<p>“Good food, magic, and interesting people to talk to. What’s not to love?”</p>
<p>“Rievan. And Illphres. And Charles de Trevalier.”</p>
<p>“Well, besides them.”</p>
<p>Both students laughed as they went back to Pisces’ room. There they pulled out the spellbook and stared at it. Ceria wanted to learn another combat spell, and Pisces was still staring at one spell he claimed to half-understand already. After a while, Pisces spoke.</p>
<p>“They’re betting on us.”</p>
<p>Ceria raised her head with a frown.</p>
<p>“Who are?”</p>
<p>“Beatrice and Calvaron. I heard they’ve put money that both of us will pass the exams.”</p>
<p>“People bet on who’ll pass? Wait, of course they do.”</p>
<p>Ceria sighed. She felt annoyed that Calvaron and Beatrice were treating her getting into Wistram so trivially, but Pisces took the opposite view. He smiled at her.</p>
<p>“Don’t be angry. If they didn’t like us or care they wouldn’t have made the bet. I think they’re trying to help us. They give us tips and secrets for free all the time, don’t they?”</p>
<p>“I guess. It’s just—we’re going to need more than a bit of help if we want to be sure we’ll pass.”</p>
<p>Ceria sighed, dispirited. Pisces raised his eyebrows and tapped the book in front of them.</p>
<p>“That’s what this is for. Look here—I’m certain this spell is in fact [Flash Step]. I had to get to one of the encyclopedias to look it up, but the spell’s description seems to match this spell exactly!”</p>
<p>Filled with sudden interest, Ceria peered at the spell. She nodded.</p>
<p>“You could be right!”</p>
<p>Then her face fell.</p>
<p>“But there’s only three weeks left until the exams. Not enough time for either of us to learn it.”</p>
<p>“I think I can do it. At the very least, I want to try.”</p>
<p>Ceria stared at Pisces. She knew he was smart. But this? [Flash Step] was a Tier 3 spell.</p>
<p>“You’re going to try?”</p>
<p>“Of course. And you can learn [Stone Fist] as well. If we work together, we’ll pass the exams.”</p>
<p>Pisces grinned at her. Ceria felt her heart pounding in her chest. Just heard it. She smiled at Pisces, and held up a fist for him to bump his cautiously against.</p>
<p>“Definitely.”</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Wistram was a world unto itself, with a different set of rules, a different kind of people. And yes, Ceria thought to herself as she cautiously opened her door, a different sense of time.</p>
<p>This early in the morning the hallway was empty. Seemingly empty. But Ceria knew better than to step out incautiously. She whispered a spell as she stared hard at the floor and ceiling.</p>
<p>“[Detect Magic].”</p>
<p>The world faded. Colors became less vivid in Ceria’s eyes, while others sprung out at her, as if they were the only real things in a blurred reality. And so when she looked again, Ceria could clearly see the hex that had been drawn on the flagstones in front of her door.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>It was a spell that would make the ground slippery like grease. Ceria moved to destroy the hex and then paused. She glanced suspiciously around the hex, and then peeked her head around the doorjamb. That’s when she saw the second, far less obvious spell about to go off.</p>
<p>She gritted her teeth. Ceria pushed mana into her hands and raised it. A jet of flame scorched the stone and disrupted the fragile matrix of the trap spell. The half-Elf grimly watched both spells disappear as she dared step outside at last.</p>
<p>“A shock spell? Dead gods. Those damn Human—”</p>
<p>She caught herself. She didn’t <em>know</em> it was a Human who’d cast the spell. But she was pretty sure it was.</p>
<p>“Charles de Trevalier.”</p>
<p>Ceria muttered his name as she stalked down the corridors towards the banquet hall. She was in no mood to wait for Pisces to get up—he usually woke up late unless they had class in the mornings, anyways. So Ceria contented herself with grabbing some fruit and a piece of cheese and eating alone at one of the tables.</p>
<p>Two weeks had passed since she and Pisces had stolen the spellbook, or rather, reclaimed it from the library with Cognita’s help. It wasn’t really stealing, actually. True, other students had found the book and probably intended to retrieve it, but as Ceria and Pisces both pointed out to each other, they hadn’t gotten to it in time.</p>
<p>Therefore the book was rightfully theirs, or rather, Pisces’ property. Still, neither student had told a soul about what they’d done, even Calvaron or Beatrice. A secret like that would be worth a huge amount and Ceria didn’t want to risk having a bunch of older students angry at them.</p>
<p>Especially not at this time. There was less than a week left until the exam that would decide everything for Ceria. In five short days, she’d be tested on her magical abilities and Skills, and demonstrate what spells she’d learned while studying here.</p>
<p>In truth, this was as much of a test of her abilities as a student as it was her prowess as a mage before she’d arrived at Wistram. Ceria had heard from Calvaron and Beatrice just what the tests measured.</p>
<p>“They’ll look to see how powerful you are <em>and</em> whether you picked up on the lessons. If you’re talented in either respect, you’ll gain points. So a good mage could get accepted on their abilities or someone who’s mastered every lesson could get in solely based on that, but it’s best to be outstanding in both areas.”</p>
<p>They’d be measured in many different areas, from their ability to control fundamental magic, to how they analyzed enchantments and held their cool in battle. There were several tests Ceria had practiced for, but it was the last one, a grueling obstacle course where the students would be allowed to use attack spells to get to the end quickly, that she was focused on.</p>
<p>After so long, Ceria knew how she ranked among the prospective students in Wistram. It was common knowledge; the entrance exams were the subject of quite a number of bets and power games, again according to Calvaron.</p>
<p>Your ranking was critically important, but Ceria knew it wasn’t the only key to passing the exams. How much wealth you had—or your family had—and whether you were well liked by any influential mages could also be key.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Ceria hadn’t made any strong connections with anyone but Calvaron and Beatrice. She had no wealth besides the money she’d scraped together for the application fee. So all she could rely on was her talent.</p>
<p>And to be fair, Ceria wasn’t bad at magic. She had a higher level than most new students, and she was also quicker than most at picking up each lesson. However, the key here was ‘better than most’. Ceria wasn’t at the top of her class; she was only gifted.</p>
<p>That wasn’t reassuring. And to make it worse, Ceria knew someone who was consistently at the top of any class he took.</p>
<p>Pisces.</p>
<p>She hadn’t realized it at first, but after nearly a month of hanging out with the young man and becoming friends, Ceria had realized he truly was a prodigy at magic.</p>
<p>Pisces could pick up a spell twice as fast as Ceria could. Worse, he had a finer control over his magic. <em>His</em> lightning didn’t spark all over the place, and he could remember almost everything he was taught in class with his memory alone.</p>
<p>It made Ceria incredibly jealous at times. She knew Pisces couldn’t help being gifted anymore than she could give up her race’s affinity with magic that let them channel mana better than any other species. And yet, she couldn’t help but feel that in a few days he might be the one to stay while she left.</p>
<p>Hence, her decision to wake up so early. Ceria glumly chewed down the last of her fruit and finished the cheese. She normally liked to eat meat—morning, noon and night and for a snack—but she couldn’t have a full stomach for what she was about to do.</p>
<p>Leaving her dishes where they were—a Golem would come by and pick them up if some other students didn’t levitate them to another table—Ceria headed towards the entrance of Wistram. In truth, she’d had little reason to leave the academy before now.</p>
<p>The half-Elf took a breath of the crisp morning air and then scowled as that crisp air turned out to be full of water. She spluttered as a wave crashing against the rocks of the isle sent a spray of water into her face.</p>
<p>“Nature.”</p>
<p>She groused to herself as she stomped down the winding steps that led down to the large stone pier. The isle that was Wistram was really very small, in truth. Aside from the towering citadel that seemed to reach into the sky, there was only the docks and a separate bay where other ships could disgorge their cargo. Both were built out of stone and could hold dozens of vessels at a time, but Wistram had no grass or open areas to speak of.</p>
<p>All that was inside. Ceria had actually seen a large plaza filled with grass and trees in&nbsp; one part of Wistram, the top open to the sky. The magics that made up the citadel were such that the finite building that represented the outside couldn’t hint at the full expanse of Wistram on the inside.</p>
<p>And yet today, Ceria left the steps and made her way down to a bunch of large boulders that protected Wistram from the direct impact of the tide. This early in the morning she saw only a few other mages about. Ceria found a secluded spot where she could stare out across the ocean and took a breath.</p>
<p>“Time to practice.”</p>
<p>The first thing she did was hurl a few orbs created with the [Light] spell. The shimmering spheres hovered in the air in front of Ceria, some relatively close, but others floated up to a hundred feet away. Ceria took a deep breath, and aimed carefully at the nearest one.</p>
<p>“[Stone Dart]!”</p>
<p>It was her favorite spell and the one she was most proficient at. The dagger of stone cut through the air with a whistling sound and pierced the center of the first ball of light. Ceria grinned triumphantly as it vanished.</p>
<p>She raised her hand and carefully aimed at the next orb. Ceria concentrated hard to make sure she was right on target; it wasn’t just that she had to aim with her finger. The image of the floating orb was just as important in her mind; it could inform the angle and trajectory her spell took.</p>
<p>A second stone missile flew, and again the orb vanished soundlessly. The seagulls circling about the isle cawed raucously and the ocean waves blew up gouts of water while Ceria lined up her next shot.</p>
<p>She was practicing for the combat trial. Ceria knew most of the new students knew only a few combat spells and only Tier 1 spells at that. But she’d actually fought before! True, she’d only worked as a Bronze-rank adventurer to make ends meet now and then, but she was confident she could demonstrate her abilities in that section of the exam more than any other.</p>
<p>She just had to make sure her aim was spot-on. Thus, Ceria was practicing hitting the targets as they floated in the air. She’d done it all the time back in the forests around her home, only then she’d hunted animals and shot leaves out of trees. Here she had to make her own targets; she wasn’t about to kill the seagulls just to practice. Unless one of them pooped on her head, that was.</p>
<p>Ceria found aiming at the nearest orbs of light easy. She could hit them in rapid succession once she’d gotten her mental eye in. But past fifty feet her aim grew worse and worse. The wind blew her spells off course and she had to hit each ball of light in the center or she wouldn’t destabilize the spell enough for it to vanish.</p>
<p>The final orb floated tantalizingly some one hundred and twenty feet away. Ceria cursed as she launched dart after dart at it, growing more tired with each shot. She could only fire about thirty or so before she had to rest and she was nearing her limit even with the short break she’d took.</p>
<p>But she was determined to hit it. Ceria waited for the wind to die down and then shot a dart across the ocean. She held her breath as she stared at the orb of light and then flung her arms out in success as it went out.</p>
<p>Only when she had finally shot down the last floating orb did Ceria realize she had an audience. She turned and nearly had a heart attack as she saw a cluster of mages, all far older than any of the students Ceria hung out with—watching her.</p>
<p>These were true mages, the ones who’d stopped being students and now either taught classes or studied magic on their own. Men and women in robes, Drakes, Lizardfolk—standing a ways away from the Drakes—a Dullahan and one of the Stitch People regarded Ceria silently. Ceria saw a bird-man standing next to two women she recognized.</p>
<p>Her heart stopped. There, standing with the mages was Illphres. And standing next to her, smiling slightly was none other than Amerys, one of the King’s Seven.</p>
<p>The Calm Flower of the Battlefield. One of the King of Destruction’s generals, who had conquered a continent and threatened the world. Ceria forgot she was a fellow mage for a second and froze in panic.</p>
<p>But these mages—why were they here? Had she broken a rule for some reason? Only, they didn’t seem angry. They were just watching her. Some looked amused, others, considering.</p>
<p>“Um.”</p>
<p>Ceria could barely breathe. The mages regarded her for another silent moment, and then they moved off, as if they were done. Several leapt impossibly high into the air and floated down to rocks closer to the waves—others simply walked off in different directions around the isle.</p>
<p>Only one mage stayed. Illphres. She approached Ceria, moving slowly, face unreadable. She passed a hand over her lips and then Ceria saw a smile appear. It was slightly mocking.</p>
<p>“Sloppy aim.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Your aim is bad. You took far too long to hit that last target.”</p>
<p>Illphres nodded slowly to the ocean. Ceria felt herself blush hotly as she realized all the mages had seen her struggle to hit her final target.</p>
<p>“I got it in the end!”</p>
<p>She was angry that they’d seen her, but angrier at Illphres for lecturing her. The mage passed a hand over her face and Ceria saw her smirking now.</p>
<p>“You can hit a stationary target, but you don’t compensate for the wind. If that was a Goblin archer he would have shot you full of arrows by now.”</p>
<p>That stung because it was true. Ceria replied sharply.</p>
<p>“So I suppose you’re telling me you can aim better?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Watch.”</p>
<p>Illphres pointed, and Ceria looked up. She saw only the sky, and a flock of seagulls looking for scraps or perhaps a tasty mollusk washed up by the tides. The ice mage gestured, and one of the passing seagulls suddenly <em>squawked</em> in terror and plummeted towards the ocean. Ice had encased both of its wings.</p>
<p>Ceria bit her lip. That was a masterful shot; she’d barely seen the streak of light that had shot from Illphres’ hand to hit the bird. But killing an animal just to prove a point seemed wrong to her.</p>
<p>But the seagull never hit the water. A few feet before it would have smacked into the surf pounding the rocks around Wistram it suddenly flapped its wings and flew back upwards, still making sounds of distress. Ceria saw the ice on its wings flaking off, melting with rapid speed.</p>
<p>The gull flew off, and Illphres turned back to Ceria. She passed a hand over her face and looked expressionlessly at Ceria again.</p>
<p>“Everything is a moving target. You’ll never improve by aiming at stationary points.”</p>
<p>It was all true, but Ceria just couldn’t accept the lecture. She pointed at Illphres angrily.</p>
<p>“Teach me, then! Show me how to cast better spells!”</p>
<p>“Melt my ice first.”</p>
<p>Illphres looked at Ceria, and the half-Elf didn’t know what to say in reply. Illphres walked off, leaving Ceria alone to fume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ceria didn’t stay long after her encounter with the mages. She saw them standing on the rocks, doing something close to what she’d done. The only difference was the scale. Instead of sending out orbs of light, some created actual illusions of monsters or incoming spells which they in turn warded against or shot down with their own magic.</p>
<p>She saw Illphres shooting countless discs of frozen ice up into the air at extreme speed and then bolts of lightning catching each one and blasting it to bits. Amerys did that for about ten minutes before she switched and started conjuring birds made of electricity which Illphres shot down in turn.</p>
<p>So. Other mages did what she did? Ceria walked back to Wistram, thoroughly humiliated and not a little bit angry. It was still early and she debated going back to the banquet hall for a second breakfast and to meet up with Pisces before class today. But she paused when she saw him in the hallway.</p>
<p>He wasn’t alone. Pisces was talking with another Human—a young man Ceria recognized with a sinking feeling in her stomach. He had a pointy noise and far too gangly legs in her opinion, but he was attired in rich, colorful clothing like a [Lord]. Which he was, she supposed. It wasn’t Charles himself, but one of his good friends.</p>
<p>Timor du Havrington.</p>
<p>He looked condescending as ever, but what was he doing here talking to <em>Pisces</em> of all people? Ceria stared down the busy corridor full of students hurrying about. He and Pisces were talking while they stood next to an intersection. About what?</p>
<p>About her?</p>
<p>She didn’t want Pisces to see her. Ceria pressed her back against a wall and then realized that was stupid. Instead, she mingled with a group of students going one way, watching Pisces out of the corner of her eye as she walked.</p>
<p>“…happen to agree with you on that point, Havrington. However…”</p>
<p>That was all she heard as she passed by. Ceria desperately wanted to turn and look back, but she was afraid of being spotted. And afraid, perhaps, of what she might hear. She slowly made her way back to her room and only saw Pisces again during lunch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Well, well. If it isn’t my favorite half-Elf! Where’ve you been Ceria? We missed you at breakfast! Wait—don’t tell me. I already know.”</p>
<p>Calvaron’s cheerful greeting made Ceria want to pull his tail. She scowled at him and ducked as a flash of magic flew overhead. He and Beatrice didn’t seem to notice, but then, they’d erected a shield spell around their table.</p>
<p>“Hi Calvaron. Hi, Beatrice. What in the name of tree fungus is going on?”</p>
<p>She pointed across the hall at the circle of students watching two mages exchange blasts of magic, but Calvaron began laughing instead.</p>
<p>“What in the name of—did you hear that Beatrice? Did you hear what she said? Do all half-Elves swear by plants?”</p>
<p>“I did. Be polite.”</p>
<p>Beatrice slapped Calvaron on the shoulder and pointed towards the two fighting mages.</p>
<p>“It’s a duel. Seric and Zepheral are quarrelling over a wand one of them found in an unexplored room. The winner gets to keep it.”</p>
<p>Calvaron nodded.</p>
<p>“Want to place a bet? The smart money’s on Seric, but Zepheral could pull it off. I’ve got three-to-one odds on Seric.”</p>
<p>Pisces, eying the battle warily, ducked as a stray arrow of light splashed across the top of their shield.</p>
<p>“I’m ah, more worried about our safety. Do such duels occur often?”</p>
<p>“Worried? Hey, this shield spell won’t break from a stray shot! And yes, duels are fairly common. I’m surprised you haven’t seen any before, but then, the Council likes to ease you new students into life here. Can’t have fights breaking out on the first day.”</p>
<p>“And students duel for money, pride, what?”</p>
<p>“Anything and everything, Ceria! It’s like secrets; just another way for a mage to get ahead if they so choose. And you don’t have to fight with spells—there are spoken debates too.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Pisces’ eyes lit up at that. Calvaron wagged a finger.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah. They’re usually decided by collective vote, so don’t go thinking the student who knows the most words wins, Pisces. It’s actually quite tricky, since you can’t rely on personal magnetism to win the debate. Those who vote have to answer under truth spell who made the more convincing argument.”</p>
<p>“All the more reason for me to attempt this. You say you can win money with this?”</p>
<p>Pisces grinned at Ceria, who had to force herself to smile back. Calvaron nodded, wincing good-naturedly as a cry went up from the crowd watching the duel.</p>
<p>“Students duel with magic and words in the halls of Wistram. Well, I say students, but all the [Mages] here do it. The older ones just do it with a lot more pomp and ceremony. Ooh! Looks like Seric’s going to win this one. Did you see that, Beatrice? [Air Volt]. Right to the chest! Zepheral’s not walking away from that one.”</p>
<p>“Looks like I win my bet. Good.”</p>
<p>Pisces and Ceria watched as the crowd began to disperse. Apparently Seric had won, and some students were helping to magically carry Zepheral—the unconscious Drake—away.</p>
<p>“Never a quiet moment in Wistram, huh?”</p>
<p>“You know it. But Ceria, I hear you had an interesting encounter this morning.”</p>
<p>Pisces turned, eyebrows raised and Ceria scowled at the Centaur.</p>
<p>“Dead gods, Calvaron! Do you keep your ear pinned to the ground or something?”</p>
<p>“Only when it involves my friends. And quite a few people saw you practicing outside. And how you ran into all the other mages too.”</p>
<p>Ceria covered her face as Pisces demanded and received an explanation.</p>
<p>“Why were they out there? I thought I’d be alone that early in the morning.”</p>
<p>Beatrice blinked slowly at Ceria as she scratched an itch on the back of her head.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know? All the mages inclined towards combat get up early to train. They probably wondered whether you wanted to join them.”</p>
<p>“Oh bark mold.”</p>
<p>Ceria put her head in her hands and groaned as Pisces and Calvaron laughed.</p>
<p>“Shut up! I didn’t know, okay?”</p>
<p>“Don’t fret, Springwalker. Look at it this way; attracting their attention can’t hurt you, especially if they think you might be an asset to the academy.”</p>
<p>“It can if they saw how badly I did! I was trying to get back my aim in <em>secret!</em>”</p>
<p>“Well, you should have practiced elsewhere. The rocks around the academy are a favorite spot for all mages to practice. Less bodies to hit if their aim’s off, you see.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know you were practicing. Was it for the exam?”</p>
<p>Pisces looked at Ceria with a frown. She nodded, not meeting his eyes.</p>
<p>“Ceria’s got the right idea, Pisces. She’s rated high for passing the combat portion ahead of most of the students. You should just try and get top marks in other areas. Mind you, you might have a shot at doing well in the combat portion too, given that no one’s taken classes in combat magic so far.”</p>
<p>“Thanks to Illphres.”</p>
<p>“I hate her so much.”</p>
<p>Ceria mumbled to herself as she stuffed her mouth full of cottage cheese. Calvaron shrugged.</p>
<p>“It’s not good for anyone, but hey, after the exams I’m sure the Council will find someone else to teach you lot. They can’t have you not being taught for an entire year.”</p>
<p>“Too late if we fail.”</p>
<p>“You’re so pessimistic! But hey, speaking of Illphres, did you know that Charles de Trevalier got into her classroom?”</p>
<p>“<em>No.</em>”</p>
<p>Pisces and Ceria both stared at Calvaron in shock. He nodded.</p>
<p>“Apparently, your good friend Charles was seen in the classroom. He caused a big commotion, calling for Illphres to come and teach him.”</p>
<p>“So she taught him, then? How’d he manage to get past the ice?”</p>
<p>“That’s the thing.”</p>
<p>Calvaron’s eyes twinkled in amusement.</p>
<p>“He got in, but apparently he got someone else to melt the ice for him. Anyways, it was obvious he hadn’t done it himself, so Illphres said it didn’t count. I heard she and Rievan were arguing about it and she nearly froze his face off. He’s probably the one who did it, although it must have been a struggle.”</p>
<p>“Rievan and Charles are working together?”</p>
<p>Ceria exchanged a horrified glance with Pisces. She’d noticed Rievan didn’t pick on Charles nearly as much for his failures, but she hadn’t expected the two people who hated her most to join forces. Calvaron nodded seriously.</p>
<p>“Oh yes, Charles is heavily in Rievan’s camp now. He’s part of the Libertarian faction for sure. They’ll love having someone with his family’s deep pockets and influence, that’s certain. And if they throw a bit of help back towards his family when they’re having their own political battles, well, everyone wins.”</p>
<p>“Great. Just great.”</p>
<p>Ceria put her head down on the table. Pisces patted her gingerly on the back while Calvaron and Beatrice discussed what they’d do with their winnings.</p>
<p>“I think this is a great time to break out that drink I just bought. Beatrice, can you get some more quiches? Or maybe some of those eggrolls—or just cold cuts of meat? I’m told this goes well with spicy food, but I hate spices.”</p>
<p>“On it.”</p>
<p>The Dullahan left the table as Ceria raised her head in time to see Calvaron producing two glasses and a bottle and placing them on the table. He had a very limited bag of holding that let him carry objects around.</p>
<p>“What’s this? Are you drinking at lunch?”</p>
<p>“Just a bit, just a bit. I made a good bundle betting on that duel. And this is a treat. Here—Pisces will you hold this bottle? I need to get this out…”</p>
<p>“What’s that? Salt?”</p>
<p>Ceria watched disbelievingly as Calvaron took out a small pouch of salt and began to add it to the rims of the glasses. He lined one and then poured some of the pale lime-colored liquid into the glass.</p>
<p>“There we are. Mm. This smells good. This, my dear Ceria, is called a Sand Tumbler—it’s an alcohol made with limes and lemons, I think. Don’t ask me why it’s called that. It’s a tasty drink—an alcohol I just bought from a ship captain who had a cargo full of drinks.”</p>
<p>“But salt?”</p>
<p>“It’s part of how you drink it. Again, don’t ask me why. But it—ooh, it does taste good! Here, Beatrice, you have to have one of these!”</p>
<p>Calvaron sipped from his glass with appreciation and delight. Beatrice, returned with a platter of food, reached for her own glass to prepare it like he had. Calvaron drank his, but objected when he saw Beatrice sprinkling the salt.</p>
<p>“Aw, Beatrice! Don’t put salt <em>in</em> the glass! A Sand Tumbler is supposed to have it on the rim. It adds to the taste!”</p>
<p>“I like salt. What about on the ice?”</p>
<p>“No, no! It’ll melt the ice and—look, let me do it, alright?”</p>
<p>Huffily, he showed Beatrice how to prepare the glass properly. When she was sipping it with apparent appreciation he turned back to Ceria and Pisces.</p>
<p>“I like to treat myself to the latest delicacy when I can afford it. Did you know this comes from Chandrar? It’s very refreshing—do either of you want to try one?”</p>
<p>Pisces declined. Ceria was sorely tempted, but she knew she had better spend all her time studying, not drinking.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to cram as much as we can right now, Calvaron. I’d love to stay, but unless you want to show us how to decipher complex enchantments—”</p>
<p>He groaned and Beatrice rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“Dead gods, I’d rather let Illphres use me as a target than study that again. You two go study. Good luck!”</p>
<p>The two students left Calvaron and Beatrice to share their drink with a few students who’d drifted over, lured by the call of alcohol and snacks. Pisces was excited about the duel and Ceria was quiet, conflicted by her doubts.</p>
<p>“I do believe I might actually participate in a duel. Not a physical one—I’d rather not get hurt—but a verbal duel sounds promising! I might make some spending coin off of it. What do you think, do I have a chance?”</p>
<p>“If your opponent gets half as confused as I do, you’ll win for certain.”</p>
<p>Ceria smiled weakly at Pisces as they walked into his room. It had become their place to study, mainly because it was so convenient. And it had a balcony. He eagerly began spreading his notes over his bed and table as Ceria took a chair.</p>
<p>“What shall we focus on today? I thought we might work on our spell composition. I know that Rievan’s focused on it a lot already, but I think there’s room to improve.”</p>
<p>“Um, Pisces.”</p>
<p>He looked up as Ceria spoke quietly. Her heart was pounding, but she had to know.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Earlier this morning, I saw you talking with Timor. What was that about?”</p>
<p>She watched his face anxiously. Pisces wasn’t a good liar, Ceria knew. Or she thought she knew. He paused, and scratched at his hair as if trying to remember.</p>
<p>“Him? Oh that—nothing of consequence. I was just on my way to breakfast and he stopped me—”</p>
<p>“Pisces, please. I have to know.”</p>
<p>He paused, and then turned to look Ceria in the eye. Pisces sighed, and took a seat on his bed.</p>
<p>“Timor did, in fact approach me this morning to extend an invitation to me. To join him and Charles in their…faction. The Libertarians. They offered me quite a few incentives.”</p>
<p>Ceria felt a hand squeezing at her heart. It wasn’t what she’d feared, but it still made her worried.</p>
<p>“And? What did you say?”</p>
<p>“I refused him outright, of course!”</p>
<p>Pisces looked indignant and hurt that Ceria had to ask. He stood up, smoothing his robes.</p>
<p>“I told him no, but he kept pestering me. He wanted me to abandon my friendship with you so I could add my abilities to Charles and support him. I’ve apparently got good odds to pass the exam and the Libertarians want every new student they can get.”</p>
<p>“Why’d you say no? They can offer you a lot more than you’d get by being independent.”</p>
<p>“Hardly. You know what Calvaron said about factions.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but…”</p>
<p>Ceria trailed off miserably. She didn’t want to suspect her friend, but she did. Pisces looked at her, and his tone softened.</p>
<p>“Ceria, I turned him down. I would never join with him. You are my…friend.”</p>
<p>He said the word cautiously. Ceria blinked up at him and Pisces colored. He turned and spoke rapidly.</p>
<p>“Besides, Timor’s offer was quite disingenuous, I felt. I am completely disinclined to subsume myself into a close-minded group that bows to the most influential member without discourse or free thought. Your company—and that of the other myriad members of each species—is far more pleasant for me.”</p>
<p>That was what he said, but his real meaning was far easier to understand. Ceria surprised herself by standing up and giving Pisces a quick hug.</p>
<p>“You’re a good friend Pisces, but you talk too much.”</p>
<p>He grinned at her, embarrassed, but pleased.</p>
<p>“So I’ve been told. Were you really that worried?”</p>
<p>“Not really—well, okay, a bit. Charles has it out for me.”</p>
<p>“I know he doesn’t like you, but do you really think he would try to get to you through me?”</p>
<p>Pisces frowned, but Ceria nodded with conviction.</p>
<p>“Positive. He doesn’t do anything openly, but you heard Calvaron. Charles is allied with Rievan and I think he’s been doing other stuff in secret. I’ve been finding trap spells and hexes around my room every few days when I wake up. I think he and his friends are planting them there each night.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know about this! Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>
<p>Pisces looked outraged. He eyed Ceria and then turned red.</p>
<p>“You thought <em>I </em>was the one doing it?”</p>
<p>“I was wrong, okay? Look, Pisces. I know you’re a good friend. I do. But you’re Human and there’s a history between my people and yours.”</p>
<p>“So I’ve been given to understand, but this much? Charles didn’t like you on sight, but why? Is there really that much animosity?”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded tiredly. She wasn’t surprised Pisces didn’t know; if he’d grown up away from half-Elves or in a different nation he wouldn’t have the same perspective.</p>
<p>“I’m a half-Elf. He’s a Human noble. At one time my people ruled over most of Terandria and enslaved Humans.&nbsp; It’s a longstanding grudge and it’s not as if Humans and half-Elves have gotten along splendidly since then. I’ll just bet Charles is from one of the Human families my people used to enslave.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Or it could just be he hates half-Elves. Some Humans just hate other species. Stitch-people are widely accepted although some people get freaked out by them, but half-Elves are much more disliked. Lots of Humans hate us just for being, well, half Elf.”</p>
<p>“I don’t.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but you’re a bit strange.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Pisces grinned. Ceria smiled at him and felt better. He cleared his throat, looking at his scattered notes.</p>
<p>“Not to change the topic, but regardless of whether Charles is planning something, if we don’t study we’ll fail the exams anyways. Should we get to work?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely. Come on, let’s practice. Show me how you get your lightning to go straight, will you?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That night, Ceria slept more soundly than she had for a few days. But she was woken up just past midnight by a loud scream just outside her door. She sat up, heart pounding as she heard panicked voices outside.</p>
<p>“<em>Aah!</em>”</p>
<p>“What <em>are </em>they?”</p>
<p>Ceria heard shouting as she ran to wrench her door open. When she raced out into the corridor, hands ablaze with fire, ready to throw it at whoever was outside, she saw retreating shapes running down the corridor. They were being followed by a stream of…</p>
<p>“Ceria?”</p>
<p>Pisces yanked open his door, looking bleary-eyed and confused. He stared around, but now the corridor was deserted. A few other students were opening their doors as well, wondering what was going on.</p>
<p>“I think they were trying to put a trap on my door again. But something chased them off.”</p>
<p>“How strange.”</p>
<p>Pisces looked innocent. Too innocent. Ceria squinted at him suspiciously.</p>
<p>“You did something, didn’t you? What chased them off?”</p>
<p>“Mice, I believe. I ah, cast a spell to attract a few of them.”</p>
<p>Pisces grinned at Ceria and closed the door. She stared at it and smiled before going to sleep. If the next day Calvaron pointed out a few Human students with small bites all over their arms and legs, neither Pisces nor Ceria commented on it. Some secrets were just that: secret.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last few panicked days of studying, one last important thing happened as Ceria and Pisces were studying. Both mages poured over the spellbook they’d taken from the library each night before they went to sleep. Ceria had given up on learning [Stone Fist] in time—she thought with a week or two she might do it, but not when she had to devote her time to memorizing all her lessons.</p>
<p>But Pisces doggedly worked at decoding the spell he’d focused on. And as Ceria was sitting with her back to a wall in his room, trying to create the perfect [Stone Dart] to use as a model for her spells, he suddenly exclaimed and shot to his feet.</p>
<p>“I’ve figured it out!”</p>
<p>She looked up. Pisces was waving his arms about. He took a step—and suddenly blurred, appearing several feet forwards in an instant. She gaped. He turned to her triumphantly ecstatic.</p>
<p>“Look, look! Ceria, look! I can do the spell!”</p>
<p>He took another step and vanished. Ceria heard a yelp and saw him reappear and knock over the desk. Pisces jumped about and cradled his shin. She was dumbstruck.</p>
<p>“What? But how?”</p>
<p>“[Flash Step]! I told you I could learn it! It’s so useful! See—look at this!”</p>
<p>He took another step and appeared right in front of Ceria. She recoiled, but Pisces just grabbed her hands.</p>
<p>“I did it, Ceria! It’s so wonderful.”</p>
<p>He stepped away from her, disappearing and reappearing again. Ceria watched, open-mouthed. Pisces took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“It works. And I can use it. If I…”</p>
<p>He broke off, and began to mumble to himself. Ceria just stared at him. He’d really done it. And so quickly! It had been what, less than three weeks? She couldn’t imagine any other new student learning a Tier 3 spell so quickly.</p>
<p>But he’d done it. And now Pisces did something that made Ceria go speechless. He took another step and disappeared. Reappeared. He wasn’t teleporting, but rather moving so quickly around the room that he generated his own gusts of wind. But Pisces wasn’t doing it randomly.</p>
<p>He moved about the room, slower now. Ceria watched, mouth slightly open as she saw Pisces’ energetic leaping about turn into something else.</p>
<p>Was it a dance? Ceria had seen a waltz before, and what Pisces did now looked similar. His feet moved slowly, but with each step he flicked a few feet away. And yet, not once did he crash into a wall. Slowly, Pisces circled the room, stepping, turning, one arm on his hip, the other held outwards.</p>
<p>Turn, step, pivot, step. Pisces snatched up his rapier and then it was in his hands. He circled the small room, vanishing from sight and reappearing, facing off against some imaginary opponent. Just…circling.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t been using [Flashstep], Pisces would have just been moving about in a complicated dance of steps with rapier in hand, to better maneuver around his opponent. But with the spell he was suddenly impossible to predict. He moved about Ceria and she was sure that if she had a sword she’d be hard pressed to strike at him.</p>
<p>Still, that wasn’t what kept her eyes on Pisces. It was that he never hit anything. His room was large, yes, but even so, one careless step or moving a bit too far with the [Flashstep] spell would send him face-first into one of the stone walls. Yet Pisces never hit anything. He moved around gracefully, exerting perfect control over a spell he’d learned just moments ago.</p>
<p>Pisces walked for a long time, rapier held at the ready, doing a dance that made it appear like there were ten versions of him in the room at once, all flicking in and out of sight. Ceria watched silently, spellbook in hand. She stared at the young man, eyes closed, face upturned. She wondered who he was, who he had been before he had come here.</p>
<p>He was a genius. Pure and simple. And she envied him and delighted in the fact that he was her friend. A Human. A Human she could call friend.</p>
<p>She wanted to keep studying with him. She wanted to pass the exam. But when Ceria looked at Pisces, dancing about with flawless perfection, she knew she’d never be able to copy what he did. So Ceria bent down over her spellbook and got back to studying. She had to pass.</p>
<p>She had to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The day of the exam, all the prospective students gathered in front of the double doors where their exam would take place. Ceria supposed finding the spot was an exam in itself; any student who couldn’t navigate Wistram’s halls by now deserved to fail.</p>
<p>All of the students stood talking or practicing spells by themselves or in small groups. Ceria was with Pisces. Neither student had had the stomach to eat much this morning. They’d already been wished well by Calvaron, Beatrice, and a few other students who were rooting for them.</p>
<p>Now Ceria stared at the two marble doors, wondering why anyone would bother making doors out of marble so she didn’t worry about how she was going to perform. There could be no mistakes, she knew. If she failed, or if she took more than one try to do something, it would be noted by the mages who’d gathered to watch.</p>
<p>There weren’t a dedicated group of examiners for the test. Some mages like the teachers had to attend, but all the mages had a voice in choosing who would pass and who would fail. That made Ceria worried.</p>
<p>Very worried, especially when she saw Rievan talking with Charles and a group of his friends off to one side. The young man looked too relaxed, and so did Timor and a few other of his friends.</p>
<p>“I bet they’ll pass one way or another. If Rievan can’t get them through, Charles and Timor can just pay their way in.”</p>
<p>Pisces muttered that to Ceria. She nodded, glaring at Charles. He looked over and saw her. Before Ceria could debate whether to look away he was approaching.</p>
<p>“Don’t fight, Ceria.”</p>
<p>“I won’t.”</p>
<p>She murmured it and then looked up to glare at Charles.</p>
<p>“Something you want, Charles?”</p>
<p>“That’s Charles de Trevalier to you, half-Elf. And this hallway is free for anyone to use, as is Wistram. Not that your people would know what being free meant.”</p>
<p>Timor sniggered behind Charles. Ceria saw some heads turn, but she was in no mood to spar with Charles. She shot back at the young man.</p>
<p>“Go boil yourself. You smell like rotted fish.”</p>
<p>Charles’ nose turned white with outrage, but before he could retort, Ceria walked away from him. Pisces followed, grinning happily.</p>
<p>“I do believe that was the most civil conversation you’ve had with him.”</p>
<p>“If I fail the exam, it’ll be the last. That would be the one silver lining.”</p>
<p>“It won’t come to that. We’ve studied.”</p>
<p>He squeezed her arm, and Ceria smiled at him. And then, before both students were ready, the doors opened. A mage stepped out, making the students go instantly quiet as if he’d cast a [Silence] spell.</p>
<p>“Come in groups of eight! Order has no meaning.”</p>
<p>The exams were beginning. Caught off-guard, some students fearfully retreated, not wanting to be the first ones in. Others decided that boldness might earn them points and headed in. Ceria and Pisces held back until the third group, and then took the exam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A large number of applicants this year.”</p>
<p>The mages who’d gathered to watch the new students take the tests were a diverse group, both in race and faction. Of course, every group in Wistram wanted to evaluate promising students, but some had come to support their candidate, or just to mingle and talk amongst themselves.</p>
<p>Some were here against their will, too. Illphres stood with a group of influential mages, both in power and status, scowling as she stared at the students casting magic under the instruction of a mage performing the test. A few feet away from her, Rievan hovered, not quite in the group which consisted of mages from every major faction, but unwilling to mingle with other mages. He kept interjecting comments or agreeing with a comment from one of the mages which several found quite annoying.</p>
<p>“Too many students is what I think. This is taking too long.”</p>
<p>Illphres folded her arms. The scowl on her face didn’t change until she passed a hand over her face and it returned to its expressionless stare. The mage standing next to Illphres, a tall Dullahan with his head held up to stare at the students, chuckled. He was unusually talkative and good-natured for a Dullahan, which meant he was about normal when compared to how much Humans acted out.</p>
<p>“You’d say that if we had one applicant, Illphres. But some of these candidates are genuinely talented. Look at those two. The half-Elf and the young Human on the left side. See?”</p>
<p>“I see. So what?”</p>
<p>A pale Selphid, hair dyed dark blue, stroked his beard thoughtfully as he studied Pisces and Ceria showing off their control of magic with the other students.</p>
<p>“A half-Elf? She’s not bad and they do have more talent than most. But the Human next to her—”</p>
<p>“Gifted.”</p>
<p>One of the Lizardfolk said that. She was a tall, sinuous woman with a head that resembled a cobra’s. Her arms and legs were longer than a Drake’s and she was distinctly reptilian, whereas the Drakes more closely resembled Humans and their draconic ancestors. She nodded at Pisces approvingly as he demonstrated his perfect control over the [Electric Jolt] spell.</p>
<p>“Ooh yes. I like him. He’s very good. We should accept him.”</p>
<p>Rievan raised his voice hurriedly as the others agreed.</p>
<p>“We haven’t finished the tests, Quexia. I think there’s still more considerations to be made. I told you, we’ve already seen some good candidates. Charles de Trevalier for instance is quite talented for being so new to the craft—”</p>
<p>“Shut up, Rievan. No one’s interested in a lordling with money. He can buy his way in if he wants, but he’s as talented as my left toe. Less.”</p>
<p>Illphres interrupted without looking at the mage. Rievan flushed angrily, but dared not reply. He glared instead at Pisces and Ceria, fervently wishing bad luck on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ceria felt like she was making a mistake every time she cast a spell. She was so nervous her hands shook. It didn’t help matters that she’d spotted Rievan among the watching mages, and he seemed like he was trying to cast a spell on her with his eyes alone. Ceria was pretty sure that was impossible, but it added to the pressure she felt.</p>
<p>She felt herself getting tired and worried—and a bit lightheaded because she’d forgotten to eat enough! And always, she could feel Rievan’s gaze on her. It made Ceria make simple, stupid mistakes a few times and she berated herself for slipping up.</p>
<p>The exams were exhaustive. Even with eight or more students being tested at a time, they took a while. Ceria had to do everything from repeat lessons on magical theory to demonstrate spells they’d learned, or pick out dangerous artifacts from a lineup presented to her. Some of the tests were easy, just to make sure she knew what she was doing, but others were fiendishly hard, so that the best students could distinguish themselves.</p>
<p>Ceria did passably well at everything. She was proud of herself for picking out an artifact that would have caused horrible itching out of a lineup when everyone but Pisces had missed it, and mortified when her [Stone Dart] spell was found to have an imperfection in its composition. But she thought she hadn’t done anything <em>too </em>badly wrong, so Ceria kept going.</p>
<p>Soon, she and the other students were done with all but one of the tests and she had to lean exhaustedly against a wall as Pisces nervously paced back and forth around here. There was only one test left, and Ceria tried to gather all of her wits about her for it.</p>
<p>“Alright, the combat test is next. You, students. Twenty of you come with me. The rest of you will have to wait.”</p>
<p>Ceria’s stomach twisted into a knot as she heard those words. This was it. Time to prove she could fight as well as cast magic. She didn’t join the second group, but told Pisces she was going in the next one.</p>
<p>“I’ll go with you. Just don’t hit me with a spell, please.”</p>
<p>“You’ll just dodge it if I do. Are you going to [Flash Step] your way to the end? And why’d you bring your rapier? You won’t need it!”</p>
<p>He grinned at her nervously, hands shaking. He had buckled the rapier to a belt over his robes which made him look slightly ridiculous, but Ceria hadn’t told him that.</p>
<p>“I might. I have no idea what’s going to be on the test. Did you know, last year Calvaron said the examinees had to fight a Troll?”</p>
<p>“They did not! Who’d be stupid enough to pit new mages against a Troll? They’d be dead in a heartbeat!”</p>
<p>“I’m just saying—”</p>
<p>The doors opened. Ceria jumped, and walked towards the mage before he announced they were ready for the next group. She heard a groan as Pisces joined her.</p>
<p>“What,<em> what?</em>”</p>
<p>“Look to your right. See who’s joining us?”</p>
<p>Ceria turned and saw Charles and Timor and two of their friends standing with the mages. Her heart sank as they smirked at her.</p>
<p>“What are they doing?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. They can’t interfere during the exam. Not with all the mages watching—”</p>
<p>“I guess.”</p>
<p>Ceria wasn’t so sure, but there was no time to do anything. The mage took them down a corridor, and then Ceria entered into a strange corridor.</p>
<p>The walls, the ceiling, the floor seemed…vaguely transparent. Ceria gasped as she saw the stones were actually ghostly replicas of the real thing. And yet, the mage assured them the corridor was solid.</p>
<p>“Mages will be watching from the outside. Ignore them. Your only job is to prove you can navigate your way down the corridor and pass the other obstacles with your own magic. If you fail, just say so and you will be removed. Your speed, ability to handle each obstacle, and resourcefulness will all be taken into consideration. You will begin when I say so.”</p>
<p>Ceria eyed the empty stone corridor with trepidation. She had no idea what was ahead of her, but she was busting with nervous energy. Beside her, she felt Pisces tensing.</p>
<p>“<em>Now!</em>”</p>
<p>At the mage’s words the students started. Ceria took two steps forward and <em>ducked</em> as a fireball came hurtling down the corridor towards the group of students. Half of them screamed, one fainted, and Pisces vanished.</p>
<p>“Ceria!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Standing together watching the students make their way through the first part of the combat test, the mages chortled as the fake [Fireball] spell burst harmlessly among the group, showering them with fire.</p>
<p>“I never stop enjoying that.”</p>
<p>“One of the students has fainted? Well, I think he’s out.”</p>
<p>“Did you see that, though? The half-Elf dodged most of the blast, but that young man avoided it completely!”</p>
<p>“[Flash Step]. At his age? Impressive.”</p>
<p>“Now, how will they do with the traps? Oh? Looks like that half-Elf is quite daring. Isn’t she the one I saw practicing in the morning?”</p>
<p>Illphres watched Ceria navigating the traps ahead of the others. She was doing well, avoiding or disarming the ones in front of her.</p>
<p>“She’s nothing special.”</p>
<p>“Well, she’s doing well enough. Oh, look. That Trevalier boy’s set off three traps. Hah!”</p>
<p>Rievan ground his teeth as he watched the students move through the hallways of traps. But he comforted himself, knowing what came next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Monsters!”</p>
<p>Someone screamed that, which made Ceria want to kick them. She dove out of the way as a shimmering bird that seemed to be made of light dove at her. Of course it was a monster! If you had the time to shout it, you might as well cast a spell!</p>
<p>“[Stone Dart]!”</p>
<p>She shot the bird through the head and it dissipated into fragments of light. All around her, students were fighting a swarm of magical creatures, the next part of the gauntlet that was their combat test. Ceria had gotten into the room first, but she’d been hard-pressed to progress. Some of the illusions were the circling birds who dove at you from overhead, but there was a huge Troll guarding the exit and she was wary of getting close.</p>
<p>“A damn <em>Troll?</em> Someone’s got a sick sense of humor!”</p>
<p>She growled as she shot down a huge wolf that was running at her, mouth open. All the illusions seemed so <em>real!</em> She’d already been hit twice, but instead of being injured, the apparitions had left bright, shining marks where they’d struck her.</p>
<p>Ceria was determined not to get hit again. She saw some students scream as a flock of the shimmering birds dove at them. Pisces was blinking around the room, dodging desperately and she saw most of the other students were huddled near the entrance of the trap corridor, throwing spells desperately.</p>
<p>This was her chance. Ceria called all the mana she could into her fingers and aimed at the swarm.</p>
<p>“<em>[Stone Dart]!</em>”</p>
<p>This time not one dart flew, but a score of them. Ceria fired the spell repeatedly, shooting jagged shards of rocks into the swarm, trying to hit as many birds as possible.</p>
<p>A score of the shimmering birds fell, the light-flesh of their bodies shattering and fading as they struck the floor. Ceria grinned as she ran forwards at the head of the group. There were still monsters left, but she had a clear shot to the Troll.</p>
<p><em>This</em> was what she’d been practicing for! Ceria raised her finger, aiming for the Troll’s vulnerable eyes—</p>
<p>And felt something crash into the back of her head. She stumbled, and the world went dark. Something had hit her. But this was a test. What—?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“That damn brat! He hit the half-Elf on purpose!”</p>
<p>Some of the mages were calling out in outrage. Rievan was raising his voice, trying to placate them.</p>
<p>“It was an accident. A slip of the finger!”</p>
<p>“Was this your plan? If this is what the Libertarians call fair, I won’t have it! I demand a retrial!”</p>
<p>“Now? You’ve got to be joking. We saw the half-Elf go down by accident.”</p>
<p>“My tail it was an accident!”</p>
<p>“It’s too late to retry. We’ll just have to judge her by what we’ve seen. That’s fair. And as for that boy, I doubt he’s passing.”</p>
<p>“He’ll just buy his way in! This is outrageous—”</p>
<p>Rievan let the debate rage hotly among the other mages, sometimes shouting in support, but no longer trying to shift the argument. It was done. Ceria was lying on the ground. She couldn’t distinguish herself further in this trial. A redo of the test was unlikely, he knew. Some mages might shout, but no one wanted to give one student special treatment.</p>
<p>He stared at the examinees, smiling, but his smile faded when he saw what was going on. Illphres shifted her cold stare from Rievan to the students still battling the illusions. She passed a hand over her mouth, and then she was smiling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pain. Dark. Ceria felt herself falling—</p>
<p>And someone caught her halfway down. Ceria felt two arms encircling her, and felt herself being lifted upwards. She felt…safe. &nbsp;Someone was calling her name. Ceria smiled. So dark.</p>
<p>The world faded. When Ceria opened her eyes again, the exam was over. But in the time between then, someone carried her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“That boy. What’s he doing?”</p>
<p>“He can’t be intending to carry the half-Elf to the end?”</p>
<p>The mages stared as Pisces lifted Ceria, dodging out of the way of the Troll’s illusory club. The Lizardwoman angrily turned towards a group of mages Rievan was standing with.</p>
<p>“See what’s happened? Now we’ll have to adjust for his performance as well. He can’t be expected to do as well carrying her!”</p>
<p>“What if we send a mage in to retrieve her? That’s simple.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but—wait a second. What’s that in his hands?”</p>
<p>The mages stared. After a moment one exclaimed.</p>
<p>“A rapier? Why’s he carrying <em>that?</em>”</p>
<p>“We <em>told</em> them it was a combat test. And I suppose some of them heard the rumor about the Troll—”</p>
<p>“If he wants to try and take it out with a rapier, that’s fine. But that’s not a display of mage combat—”</p>
<p>“Hold on!”</p>
<p>Some of the mages gasped as they saw Pisces blur with Ceria’s body in his hands. He stabbed backwards as the Troll lunged at him, and then ran the hulking beast through with his rapier. On one shoulder he carried Ceria’s unconscious body, in the other hand he held the rapier, thrusting it into the Troll’s eye.</p>
<p>“Good strike!”</p>
<p>“Look at that footwork! The Troll can’t touch him! He’ll take it down without a scratch!”</p>
<p>“That [Flash Step] spell is being used superbly! Does he have any [Warrior] classes?”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t need any. Look at his rapier.”</p>
<p>That comment came from Illphres. The mages stared, and after a second one exclaimed.</p>
<p>“A silver bell! Well, that explains that. If we’re looking at a [Swordmage] here, I say we accept him on the spot.”</p>
<p>“Even if he doesn’t want to be one, this is a splendid example of mixing magic with conventional proficiencies. I agree!”</p>
<p>Rievan stared helplessly as he watched Pisces run past the disintegrating Troll. Weapon in hand, the young man was speeding through the rest of the test almost too fast for the mages in charge to trigger the spells.</p>
<p>“Silver bell? What’s so important about a silver bell?”</p>
<p>“It means he is recognized as a true expert. It’s a Terandrian symbol of expertise.”</p>
<p>Rievan jumped. He turned and stepped backwards from Illphres. She was smiling at him and he didn’t like it.</p>
<p>“Indeed, Miss Illphres?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>She nodded at Pisces.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t have to have a [Fencer] class. A silver bell is given to those who reach a certain level in [Fencer], true, but it’s also given to those who have proven themselves by dueling a master. It’s worth a lot of money to some.”</p>
<p>She turned back to watch Pisces. Rievan clenched his fists, but he comforted himself with the thought that even if Pisces passed, his performance would only serve to eclipse Ceria’s. Regardless of whether she finished the test, she had done nothing.</p>
<p>And then the exams ended. Ceria woke up in her rooms two hours after it had finished, and cried a bit before Pisces and the others checked on her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It really wasn’t your fault, Ceria.”</p>
<p>Beatrice said that as they sat together in Ceria’s room. It was hard to fit everyone in. Besides Pisces, Beatrice, and Calvaron, some of their friends and people they’d gotten to know had come, like Cessic, to cheer Ceria up.</p>
<p>The room was crowded, especially with Calvaron in it. He kept turning and finding nowhere to go. Now he stomped one hoof angrily.</p>
<p>“It was that bastard Charles! I wouldn’t have believed he would try anything—the Libertarians have really done it now! There’s a row happening and I’ll protest what he did to the Council.”</p>
<p>“I will too. But the mages won’t redo the test, Calvaron.”</p>
<p>The Centaur deflated slightly.</p>
<p>“No. They won’t. I’m sorry, Ceria. But they saw you during the first part, and you did really well.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you did. And I’m sure they’ll take note.”</p>
<p>Ceria tried to smile, and failed. She looked at Pisces. He was avoiding her gaze, toying awkwardly with the rapier in his hands.</p>
<p>“I hear you carried me all the way to the end. Thank you, Pisces.”</p>
<p>“And he set a record doing it! Dead gods, I heard about it! Some mages are using a [Mind Scene] spell to show others—Pisces was dodging traps left and right! He barely got touched by any! He’ll be sure to pass—”</p>
<p>Calvaron broke off, awkwardly. All the other students in the room fell silent, but Ceria already knew the truth. She looked at Pisces.</p>
<p>“Thank you. I’m glad you did it. And I’m glad you’ll pass. You deserve—you deserve to be here.”</p>
<p>Ceria choked on the words. She felt like someone was tearing out her guts. Beatrice patted her softly on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“You don’t know you failed. You did as well as anyone else. Better, in many parts.”</p>
<p>But Ceria knew it was over. She knew it in her heart. She bore with the words of comfort and vows against Charles and the Libertarian party as long as she could, and then excused herself. Beatrice and Pisces offered to go with her, but Calvaron managed to get them to leave Ceria alone, which she was grateful for.</p>
<p>All she wanted to be was alone. She’d failed. Her big chance had been right in front of her—</p>
<p>And she’d failed.</p>
<p>Ceria stumbled down the corridors of Wistram, deserted except for the occasional golem or older mage. All the students were celebrating or commiserating with one another. She used one cold stone wall for support as she wandering aimlessly.</p>
<p>It wasn’t fair. Part of Ceria was raging. She wanted to kill Charles for attacking her. But why hadn’t she been ready? Why hadn’t she guessed he’d do something like this and taken precautions? She could have learned a barrier spell, or watched her back—</p>
<p>“Stupid!”</p>
<p>Ceria pounded her fist into a wall. She hit it again and again until her knuckles bled, but it didn’t help. Ceria walked on, full of despair. She wiped at her eyes and saw her tears mix with the blood.</p>
<p>She wondered if she could ask Pisces for the spellbook when she left. Maybe he’d let her take it. That way, at least she wouldn’t have done all this for nothing.</p>
<p>It was cold. Ceria shivered, and then looked up. She looked at a wall of ice, uncomprehending, until she stared about and realized where she was. Her path had taken her to the classrooms where they normally studied.</p>
<p>This was the classroom Illphres had blocked off.</p>
<p>“Get through if you’re a real mage and I’ll teach you, huh?”</p>
<p>Ceria spat bitterly and raised her fist to punch the icy wall. But it would just freeze her skin and probably tear it off. She glared at the icy wall.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that cold. It was just ice, but Illphres had made it impossible to break or melt. It was an unfair test, just like the rest of Wistram.</p>
<p>Unfair. But what could she do about it? By now, Ceria knew Calvaron would have talked everyone into doing a bit of celebrating. She dreaded going to his room, where the party would be going on. He’d probably be pouring everyone a drink and showing them how to put salt on their stupid glasses—</p>
<p>Wait a second. Ceria stopped as she had a thought. It was crazy, but…her eyes widened and Ceria dashed off through the halls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You need <em>what?</em>”</p>
<p>Calvaron stared at Ceria as she panted and tried to explain. He and Beatrice were standing outside of the large room they’d chosen to party in. Ceria could hear loud voices through the stone walls, but she had no time for drinking.</p>
<p>“Please, Calvaron. I need to take some stuff out of the kitchens, but the [Cook] there said I needed to get permission from the head [Chef] or pay. And I don’t have the coin! Please—I’ll pay you back.”</p>
<p>“Can it wait? We’re celebrating, Ceria! You should too!”</p>
<p>Calvaron stared back towards the party. He pointed into the room.</p>
<p>“Pisces is already drunk. I had to practically pour a bottle of wine down his throat so he wouldn’t go looking for you. Come on, whatever it is, it can wait!”</p>
<p>“No, it can’t. Please, Calvaron. I know I don’t have anything I can trade you, but—”</p>
<p>Beatrice looked at Ceria’s pleading face, and then nudged Calvaron. He blew out his cheeks, but nodded.</p>
<p>“Oh—fine! Tell the [Cook] that you can take whatever you need. Put it on my account.”</p>
<p>“Thank you! Thank you! Tell Pisces I’m fine! I’ve just got to go!”</p>
<p>Ceria raced off. Calvaron watched her go and turned to Beatrice.</p>
<p>“What in the name of the Great Companies was that, do you think?”</p>
<p>Beatrice shrugged. She stared at the place where Ceria had been.</p>
<p>“Should we go after her? She’s very upset.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. No—she’s got a plan. We’d better let her do what she needs to do and not draw attention. But see if the bookies will take another bet, will you? I’m thinking our dear Springwalker might have better odds than we think.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wistram was quiet the day after the exams. Most students and mages were too hungover to do anything, and the ones who weren’t suffering were disinclined to do anything when making loud noises could get half a dozen spells cast at your face. Thus, it was only a few mages who gathered outside to practice their spells by the ocean.</p>
<p>Illphres was raising pillars of ice and shattering them with the [Glacial Spear] spell when Ceria found her. The half-Elf panted as she raised a hand to touch Illphres.</p>
<p>“Miss Illphres—”</p>
<p>The woman turned faster than Ceria had ever seen her and stopped Ceria.</p>
<p>“Do not touch me. What is it?”</p>
<p>“Please, come with me.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Illphres stared expressionlessly at Ceria. The half-Elf knew she was disheveled, hair mussed, and she knew she was grimy and still damp to boot. She tried to explain.</p>
<p>“I did it. I did it. I got rid of the ice just like you said so can you come and see? So I can show you? The ice?”</p>
<p>For a second Illphres just stared at Ceria, but then she nodded.</p>
<p>“Very well. Show me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one was using the classrooms when Ceria led Illphres there. She had to slow her pace so Illphres could follow, although Ceria was bursting with impatience. Illphres didn’t move faster than a walk. The ice mage stopped though, when she saw the dripping hole in her ice wall.</p>
<p>“Hm.”</p>
<p>“I did it, you see?”</p>
<p>Ceria practically danced in front of the melted ice, half-hysterical from exhaustion. She waved her arms and nearly cried out. Her muscles were beyond burning—they felt torn, and her fingers and hands were raw and practically numb.</p>
<p>Illphres gazed at Ceria and then at the wall. She stared hard at the puddle on the stone ground, and noted the white stains on the floor. She looked at Ceria calmly and said one word.</p>
<p>“Salt.”</p>
<p>“Yes, salt!”</p>
<p>Ceria pointed triumphantly to the nearly empty bag of salt, a huge sack she’d practically depleted after she’d taking it from Wistram’s kitchens. It was so simple. Salt.</p>
<p>Salt melted ice. Ceria had used it to melt the ice, rubbing it on the frozen spell over and over and raising the heat with her own spells. She’d thought it was hopeless, but slowly, oh so slowly, the salt had helped dissolve the enchanted ice.</p>
<p>“I created this ice wall to be impervious to any spells below Tier 4. But I didn’t expect anyone to actually use something like salt.”</p>
<p>Illphres mused as she stared at the gap in her ice wall. Ceria stared at her, hopefully, desperately.</p>
<p>“But I thought of it. It’s not magic, but you didn’t say I couldn’t use salt. So I pass, don’t I? You’ll teach me spells?”</p>
<p>“There’s only three days before your probationary period ends.”</p>
<p>Illphres turned to Ceria, expressionless. Ceria’s heart sank, and then the anger in her bubbled forth.</p>
<p>“So? You said anyone who could get into your classroom you’ll teach magic! I’ll go in right now if you want!”</p>
<p>“Spare me. But what kind of a mage uses <em>salt?</em>”</p>
<p>“Me! I did it! I’ll do anything to learn magic.”</p>
<p>“So I see.”</p>
<p>“Please, teach me magic. I might not stay here, but I want to learn <em>something </em>powerful. Please, you promised!”</p>
<p>Ceria found herself begging to Illphres and hated herself for it, but she was at the end of her rope. This was the only thing she could think of, the last straw she had to grasp at. If Illphres would teach her something, maybe Ceria could earn money as an adventurer and try again next year. Or if she didn’t, she’d at least have something from Wistram.</p>
<p>For a long time the ice mage was silent. Her face was cold, like a mask, and Ceria could read nothing in her expression. For her part, Illphres looked the half-Elf in front of her up and down.</p>
<p>Ceria was as old or older than Illphres was but still a young woman by her people’s standards. Her hands were red, the knuckles and skin on her palms crackled and bleeding from the intense cold and friction. She was desperate, begging.</p>
<p>Illphres looked at the ice wall, the wall she’d created, sure that no student could break it on their own. Melted, not with a spell, but with salt and effort.</p>
<p>“Tell me, girl. What makes you think a real mage would stoop to this? A real mage would strive towards the height of magic on her own, not rely on anyone else.”</p>
<p>In front of her, Ceria took a deep shuddering breath. She looked up at Illphres, and there was a spark in her eyes of something more than determination.</p>
<p>“I know that. But I can’t become a real mage on my own. You told me that real mages don’t need help. To forge my own path. Well, I found a way to melt your damn ice, but I still need help. I want to <em>become</em> a real mage, but I’m not going to be able to stay here. So teach me something now. Please.”</p>
<p>Silence. Illphres stared at Ceria, and then nodded.</p>
<p>“Interesting.”</p>
<p>That was all. She turned away and began to walk from her classroom. Ceria jumped as the ice blocking it reformed in an instant. She called out to Illphres in despair.</p>
<p>“Wait! Where are you going?”</p>
<p>The ice mage made no reply. She walked away, and Ceria sunk to her knees in the cold corridor.</p>
<p>That was it. It was over.</p>
<p>Slowly, Ceria made her way back to her room. She crawled into bed and slept, too full of sadness to cry. She slept as she heard students stumbling out of her door, slept and willed herself never to wake.</p>
<p>But someone did wake her. Someone hammered at her door and shouted when Ceria didn’t respond.</p>
<p>“Ceria! <em>Ceria!</em> Are you in there? Get up! You passed! You did it! You <em>passed!</em>”</p>
<p>“<em>What?</em>”</p>
<p>Ceria leapt out of bed. She shoved open the door and nearly ran Pisces over. He gabbled at her and then gave up and both of them ran down the corridors, past students celebrating and crying and hugging each other. They came to the entrance hall and stared up at the floating words that danced and spun about in the massive room.</p>
<p>It was a list. A list of names. Each one was a student. Ceria saw Pisces’ name on there, no last name given, and Charles de Trevalier’s, and Timon’s too. But she had no time for that. She looked up and down the list desperately, and then saw her name. It was right on the end, hovering in the air, slightly out of place, as if tacked on at the last minute.</p>
<p><em>Ceria Springwalker.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ceria didn’t know what happened after that. She had a brief image of herself kissing Pisces on the cheek, hugging him, and then running to find Calvaron and Beatrice and hugging and crying some more. She only knew that at some point after the banquet and speeches and eating she found Illphres. Or rather, the mage found her.</p>
<p>The bathrooms in Wistram were magical as with everything else, but Ceria was far too drunk to appreciate them at the moment. She staggered out of one and nearly ran into Illphres. The ice mage was waiting for her, and scaring away all the other students who wanted to use the bathroom.</p>
<p>“I keep my promises.”</p>
<p>That was all she said. Ceria stared at her, and burst into tears. Illphres looked slightly surprised. That was to say, her eyes widened, although the lower half of her face didn’t change.</p>
<p>“Stop that.”</p>
<p>“Thank you!”</p>
<p>“Don’t thank me. You broke my enchantment.”</p>
<p>“But you—you—”</p>
<p>Ceria sniveled and Illphres rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow, class will be held in my quarters. Find your way there. Do not be drunk or late. If any of your friends manage to melt the ice I will teach them too.”</p>
<p>“Pisces will come.”</p>
<p>Ceria said that instantly. Illphres paused.</p>
<p>“I see. Will all the other students come? It is a valuable…secret you have. It might be worth much. What will you do with it, let everyone pass my test?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I don’t know what I’ll do with it. I owe someone—but Pisces will come.”</p>
<p>“So you will help your friend, to pass my test? I wonder, will you drag yourself down by pulling other people up?”</p>
<p>It was a question that wasn’t really a question, but Ceria had an answer ready. She smiled through watery eyes at Illphres.</p>
<p>“Real mages help each other. We don’t abandon each other.”</p>
<p>The ice mage stared at Ceria for a long time. Then she passed a hand over the lower half of her face, obscuring her mouth. When she lowered her hand, Ceria saw she was smiling ever so slightly.</p>
<p>“So I’ve noticed.”</p>
<p>She turned and walked away. Ceria smiled at her back, and bowed ever so slightly. Then she ran to find Pisces. She had to drink more, and tell him—and maybe Calvaron—everything. After all, she didn’t want to be in Illphres’ class alone tomorrow. She wanted to learn everything with Pisces. At last, they had time.</p>
<p>At last, they were true mages of Wistram.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Of the many wonders of the world, the isle of Wistram and the academy of mages which rests upon it is not, in fact, one of the greatest. It is not the oldest relic of the past, not by far. The tall, dark citadel of stone does not shine with the colors of a thousand glittering ores smelted into metal like the fabled Dwarf-built towers in Baleros.</p>
<p>And neither is Wistram associated with power, at least not more so than any other ancient structure. The Walled Cities of Izril speak of an era long past, when Drakes fought their distant ancestors from atop those battlements. It is not the oldest building made, nor the grandest, nor is it the most isolated.</p>
<p>And yet, for every young mage in the world, no other place could capture their hearts so. Wistram Academy represents the pinnacle of magic learning and ambition. To them, it is a long-pursued dream, and to spend just a moment in those fabled halls is what some will work towards their entire lives.</p>
<p>Which is why leaving is all the harder. The day after the yearly exams finished, the isle of Wistram saw a slight increase in the number of seafaring vessels docking in its stone harbor. Experienced [Captains] chartered from around the world made their way to Wistram to pick up the failed students. Of the hundreds who had come, as usual, less than a tenth had passed.</p>
<p>The students departed silently, some weeping, others too disappointed for words. They stared at Wistram as the ships took them out of the calm bubble around the isle. As the winds and rain descended, the gray spires of Wistram’s citadel would be the last thing they saw.</p>
<p>That is what those who had failed saw. For those who passed, their celebration was nearing its third consecutive day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has to be said that mages know how to party. Aside from being able to obtain delicacies and goods from around the world, the students at Wistram had developed quite a number of spells specifically designed to add to a party. Some were amusing, like a spell that disguised a drink’s true nature until it had been imbibed. Others were simply dangerous, as in the case of one party which saw students play a game where they aimed spells at a moving target. Fifteen students were badly injured and one nearly died.</p>
<p>However, on the third day the partying had ceased to become an all-day affair, and life was returning to normal, although the night’s entertainment was rumored to be better than last year’s. For now though, the newly accepted students stumbled into the banquet hall to eat before class. Some of them jumped in surprise when they heard the cheering from the older students, and several of them flushed red with embarrassment. They were full students of Wistram now.</p>
<p>“Aw, look at them. They’re so awkward. It reminds me of you two when you passed.”</p>
<p>Calvaron laughed as he sat at his customary table with Beatrice, Ceria, and Pisces. The others glanced up as they noted the new students streaming into the hall. Beatrice stopped spooning porridge into her mouth and turned her head to look, and Ceria did likewise. Pisces was still engrossed in his book.</p>
<p>“How many passed this year?”</p>
<p>“Thirty-four.”</p>
<p>Beatrice answered this time. She frowned as a trio of people—Drake, Human, and Lizardman – passed by. They all had deathly pale bodies and they were clearly Selphids.</p>
<p>“Lots of Selphids this year.”</p>
<p>“So? Don’t glare, Beatrice. You’ll scare them.”</p>
<p>Calvaron grinned as Beatrice looked away. She turned her head to continue feeding herself, and Ceria nudged Pisces.</p>
<p>“Hey. Get your head out of the spellbook and take a look.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>At last, Pisces blinked and looked up with a frown. He took in the new students being jeered, laughed at, and congratulated and blinked.</p>
<p>“Oh, are the exams over? That was quick.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it was. Stop reading and eat with us.”</p>
<p>Ceria yanked the worn spellbook out of Pisces’ hands. He protested, but gave in and pulled the cold plate of sausages and potatoes over towards him.</p>
<p>“You interrupted me just as I thought I was getting towards a breakthrough. I was close to figuring out the [Invisibility] spell, I’m sure of it!”</p>
<p>“You’ve been saying that all month. One break’s not going to kill you so shut up and eat.”</p>
<p>The half-Elf rolled her eyes as she levitated a tureen of gravy over while Pisces warmed his food up with a simple heat spell. In moments he was happily scarfing down his food.</p>
<p>Calvaron sighed and shook his head as he stared at the two second-year students sadly.</p>
<p>“It’s so sad.”</p>
<p>“Don’t start, Calvaron.”</p>
<p>“No, no! I have to say this.”</p>
<p>The Centaur pretended to be deeply troubled, sighing and clutching at his chest.</p>
<p>“I can’t bear to see it. How quickly you two become jaded – it feels like just yesterday you two were eager students, so happy to be admitted to Wistram! Didn’t you, Ceria, burst into tears at the table one year ago? And you, Pisces, I fondly recall you getting so drunk you thought you could cast the [Flight] spell and leaping off your balcony—”</p>
<p>He ducked as Ceria hurled one of Pisces’ sausages at him. Beatrice raised her head so she could glare at everyone.</p>
<p>“Stop that. Behave.”</p>
<p>Calvaron raised his hands and Ceria went back to her food. Pisces was busy eating. The four students were used to each other’s company after a year of studying together, and so in no time they were talking about the latest world news and gossiping over publicly available secrets. But Calvaron stopped and turned his head as someone new approached their table.</p>
<p>“Um, excuse me. Do you mind if I sit with you?”</p>
<p>Ceria paused as she reached for her goblet of milk, chewing a huge bite of sausage. She saw a young Human staring anxiously at her, a young woman to be exact, bright red hair hanging in a loose ponytail down the robes on her back.</p>
<p>“Why certainly, miss. Have a seat, please!”</p>
<p>Calvaron ushered the young woman to one of the padded chairs that went well with the low table. He waggled his fingers at Ceria and she shoved Pisces’ plate over to make room, much to his displeasure.</p>
<p>“Ceria, I’m <em>eating—</em>”</p>
<p>Pisces looked up and took in the new arrival. He coughed, and wiped his mouth with a napkin.</p>
<p>“Ah, excuse me. Who is this?”</p>
<p>“My name is Montressa du Valeross. I’m a first-year student here.”</p>
<p>The young woman bowed her head slightly, practically radiating nervousness. She seemed intimidated by the older students, especially Beatrice, who was regarding her with her usual calm. Ceria found that amusing, and noted the slight smile on Calvaron’s face.</p>
<p>“Please, sit, Montressa. Are you here for me, or something else? I’m afraid I don’t have that many secrets to buy at the moment, but if you’re looking to sell a few—”</p>
<p>“Secrets? Oh—I mean, no. I’d just like to sit and talk and—”</p>
<p>Montressa stumbled over her words. Calvaron just laughed though, and with his usual charm broke through her awkwardness.</p>
<p>“Oh, just talk is it? Well, I’m good at talking. You’re one of the students who just passed the exam? Congratulations! Don’t let my dour companions put you off—Beatrice stares at everyone, Ceria’s always grumpy and Pisces doesn’t see anything when he’s eating.”</p>
<p>He winced as a napkin, sausage, and pinch of salt bounced off his chest. Montressa laughed, covered her mouth, and thus became part of the table.</p>
<p>“So, why are you here Montressa?”</p>
<p>Calvaron asked that after the young woman had begun eating the food she’d brought. Ceria saw her pause as she lifted a forkful of buttered peas to her mouth. Montressa put her fork down and glanced at Ceria and Pisces before replying.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m ah, new here. And I was just accepted to Wistram, but I actually didn’t take the exams. I got in late you see; I’ve only been studying for a week now.”</p>
<p>Ceria saw Pisces’ eyebrows rise and she blinked in astonishment herself. But Calvaron only nodded as if it were obvious.</p>
<p>“Your family paid the full fees for this year? Well, no wonder Wistram accepted you.”</p>
<p>Montressa blushed.</p>
<p>“I wanted to take the exam, but I wouldn’t have passed and I missed the first ship you see—”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. A student’s a student. It’s just your good fortune you <em>could</em> afford to pay your way in.”</p>
<p>Ceria frowned.</p>
<p>“Du Valeross? Oh, you’re one of the Terandrian nobility, aren’t you? You wouldn’t happen to know Timor du Havrington, would you?”</p>
<p>“Me? No. I mean, I know of his family, but I haven’t talked to any of them.”</p>
<p>“Good. Otherwise we’d have to kick you out of the table.”</p>
<p>Calvaron smiled to allay the girl’s sudden panic.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. It’s nothing you’ve done. It’s just that Ceria and Pisces here don’t get along with Timor du Havrington or his friends. I’d suggest you stay away from him as well. He’s a bad egg, you know. And let me tell you, there’s nothing like a bad egg to spoil an omelette.”</p>
<p>Montressa nodded seriously, and Ceria had to pinch herself hard not to burst out laughing. She saw the same humor in Pisces and Beatrice’s eyes; Montressa was so earnest she was taking Calvaron seriously.</p>
<p>They kept eating. Montressa explained that she was an aspiring mage—she’d been tutored since she was young, but to really start her education she’d been sent to Wistram by her family.</p>
<p>“My parents are of the lesser Terandrian nobility. They want me to become a great mage and apparently I have the aptitude, so they made a gift to Wistram for my enrollment.”</p>
<p>“And no doubt you’ve been approached by all the factions already. I hope you didn’t commit.”</p>
<p>The young woman nodded nervously.</p>
<p>“I was told to avoid making promises. And I’m just learning my way around here still—I only found out about secrets yesterday. I don’t want to take sides, just study.”</p>
<p>“Good luck.”</p>
<p>Pisces sighed, and Ceria made a face. She was still independent after a year, as was he. But pressure on them was mounting too.</p>
<p>“So you’re a new, keen student. That makes sense, but I have to ask, why sit with us? We’re happy to have you, but you seem to have approached us for a reason.”</p>
<p>Montressa fiddled with her fork.</p>
<p>“I um, heard you all were really good mages. I didn’t study with the other students for the first month, so I’m really behind—I was hoping I could ask one of you to tutor me. I could pay, but I don’t have <em>that</em> much coin on me and I don’t have any secrets, so…”</p>
<p>The older students fell silent. Calvaron stroked his chin as he glanced at Beatrice. She smiled slightly and nodded a bit—Ceria shrugged and poked Pisces. He was busy eating and didn’t notice.</p>
<p>“Well, Pisces here is probably the best for that.”</p>
<p>Pisces looked up.</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you. Why don’t you help young Montressa with her studies?”</p>
<p>The young man swept a hand through his messy hair, looking distracted.</p>
<p>“Well, I <em>am</em> studying my [Invisibility] spell at the moment. It would be a time commitment but I…hm. I don’t think I’d fall behind in my own classes—”</p>
<p>“I’ll pay you. Four small secrets for helping, how about that?”</p>
<p>Montressa opened her mouth to protest as Pisces sat up and nodded. Calvaron waggled a finger at her.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah. Don’t object. You’re new and I have a soft spot for new students. After all—”</p>
<p>He clutched at his chest as Ceria rolled her eyes and smiled.</p>
<p>“—You’re only young once. Besides, Pisces really is the best mage in Wistram to help you.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes. Don’t you know who you’re sitting across from? Pisces—wipe your mouth, Pisces—is a hero, nay, <em>legend</em> among his fellow students.”</p>
<p>Montressa’s mouth fell open as Ceria tried desperately not to burst out laughing. Calvaron continued, eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>“Do you know he finished his first-year exams by killing a Troll? He was passed unanimously by all the mages. He actually <em>got</em> money from Wistram to stay, if you can believe that. A natural genius; he’s the best second-year student at dueling, and debate <em>and</em> he’s one of only six students to have passed the Ice Demon’s class last year.”</p>
<p>“Ice Demon? I heard the class last year was hard, but the teacher for this year is nice. Who is the ‘Ice Demon’? Is she actually a demon? From Rhir?”</p>
<p>“Close, but even those demons would probably run from Illphres. You might know her as the grumpy Human who never smiles at anyone. She specializes in ice magic—she had to teach a class in combat magic last year, but it was so grueling that everyone who managed to take it dropped out. Only six students passed. Two of them are sitting at this table.”</p>
<p>Pisces straightened up importantly, and Ceria waved a hand. Montressa turned huge eyes to her. It was too much. Ceria stood up, balancing her dishes on top of one another.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to go. Don’t tell Montressa too many lies, Calvaron.”</p>
<p>He looked offended.</p>
<p>“Lies? Not at all. I may exaggerate the truth, but believe me, Miss Montressa, every word I say is absolutely true. Good luck, Ceria!”</p>
<p>She waved at him as she left the table. Pisces was still eating and he waggled his fingers at her. Ceria left, striding purposefully out of the banquet hall.</p>
<p>The Ice Demon? Is that what people were calling Illphres nowadays? Ceria supposed the nickname had started last year when she was teaching. It wasn’t entirely undeserved.</p>
<p>Balancing on poles while firing magic at oncoming targets, learning to cast while in pain or under stress, aiming at targets that were invisible – in the days after Ceria had won the right to take Illphres’ class, she’d sometimes wished she’d failed the exam altogether. Although she’d traded the knowledge of how to pass Illphres’ test to Calvaron for a good price—as payment for him helping her get the salt in the first place—almost all of the students who took Illphres’ class still dropped out.</p>
<p>The woman was vindictive, mean, uncaring, and frankly, rude. She’d made each student melt the ice with the salt by themselves while she watched, which eliminated over half who simply gave up from sheer exhaustion. And yet, Ceria had leveled up more from her tutelage than anyone else’s.</p>
<p>That was why Ceria stopped in front of the door that was lined with frost two floors up from the banquet hall and waited. She knew better than to knock; Illphres’ room was so cold that the door could tear the skin off of the palm of your hand. Nor did she try to get Illphres’ attention by shouting or calling out. If Illphres knew she was here, she probably wouldn’t come out.</p>
<p>Ceria was fairly confident Illphres hadn’t gone to breakfast yet, and sure enough, after only fifteen minutes or so of waiting, the door opened. The expressionless woman with dark hair paused when she saw Ceria. The half-Elf stared innocently back at her.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Miss Illphres.”</p>
<p>The woman just stared at her. Illphres sighed, and then walked out into the corridor. She moved past Ceria without a word, walking slowly and somewhat stiffly down the hallway. Students and some mages moved aside when they saw her, but Ceria just caught up to Illphres and began chatting naturally.</p>
<p>“I gained a new class today.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>Illphres’ voice contained not a shred of interest. Ceria smiled cheerfully, forcing her mouth to move upwards.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I gained the [Elementalist] class.”</p>
<p>“How interesting.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s a good start, don’t you? It’s better than being a general [Mage], at any rate.”</p>
<p>“An [Elementalist] is just a mage who can’t commit to one specific element.”</p>
<p>That stung and made the smile on Ceria’s face falter, but she didn’t stop.</p>
<p>“Well…it’s still a class change. And I owe it all to you.”</p>
<p>“Do you?”</p>
<p>“You taught me how to improve my magic. You helped me learn so much last year. And you know, I <em>am</em> a second-year student now.”</p>
<p>“So I understand.”</p>
<p>“And I don’t have a master right now and I could really use some magical instruction…”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>She was going to make Ceria say it again. The half-Elf took a breath.</p>
<p>“Teach me magic.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You did it last year.”</p>
<p>“Because I had to.”</p>
<p>“I would really like you to be my master. Please?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Can I change your mind?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“What if I got you breakfast?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“What would you like to eat today? They’ve got mashed potatoes and sausage, but there’s also quite a good spread of greens today if you want—”</p>
<p>“Go away.”</p>
<p>“If you taught me magic, I’m sure I could help you out so much.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Please?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Pretty please?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“What if I—”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ceria didn’t get Illphres to teach her magic that day. Or the next. Or the next. But every day she found herself standing outside of Illphres’ door, and every day the ice mage looked more and more annoyed to find Ceria standing there. But she never wavered, and Ceria never gave up trying to persuade her, much to the amusement of her friends.</p>
<p>“It’s not exactly uncommon, what Ceria’s doing. She needs a master, you see. Someone to teach her magic.”</p>
<p>Calvaron explained to Montressa as the young woman sat with them and studied. She’d quickly become a part of their group and sat with them when the students ate or studied—usually in Calvaron’s room. She was earnest, enthusiastic, and, Ceria was happy to find, not at all bothered by other species. She treated Ceria exactly the same as Pisces, which was a refreshing change of pace.</p>
<p>“Do all second-year students have to get a mage to teach them?”</p>
<p>Montressa, or Mons as everyone had grown to call her, looked up from her spellbook as Pisces muttered to himself and frowned over his spellbook. He’d managed to figure out how to turn himself transparent, but that was a far cry from true [Invisibility].</p>
<p>“Not at all.”</p>
<p>Calvaron shook his head and sat up importantly. He gestured to Beatrice, who was sitting next to him and leaning against his lower half. They were sharing a blanket.</p>
<p>“You see, older students like Beatrice and I, well, we <em>have</em> to have masters because it’s simply too hard to progress otherwise. There’s a limited number of spellbooks and besides, older mages can help us in so many ways.”</p>
<p>“But it’s hard. Masters don’t always need apprentices.”</p>
<p>“Exactly, thank you Beatrice. Many mages don’t want to have to teach younger mages, so we have to persuade them. Sometimes it’s with services we can provide—I can get my master almost anything he needs thanks to my connections and Beatrice helps her master with his spells. But it’s all variable. Some mages like my master have multiple apprentices and teach them all, and others have only one like Beatrice’s.”</p>
<p>“And some don’t want apprentices. Like Illphres.”</p>
<p>“But if she doesn’t want one, then why—”</p>
<p>“Ah, well, only Ceria could tell you why anyone would be crazy enough to want Illphres as a teacher.”</p>
<p>Ceria raised her head from her spellbook and scowled at Calvaron.</p>
<p>“I think she’s an excellent mage, okay? And I want a master who knows actual combat magic. Illphres is the only mage I actually know, and I think I can convince her.”</p>
<p>Calvaron winked at Mons.</p>
<p>“There’s a running bet on. Fifty-to-one says Ceria doesn’t manage it by the end of the year. But she’s doing her best, and it’s been done before. Bothering the older mages constantly is a valid tactic.”</p>
<p>“So long as she doesn’t freeze Ceria’s ears off.”</p>
<p>“She wouldn’t do <em>that</em>, would she?”</p>
<p>Ceria just shrugged.</p>
<p>“She might. But I think she likes me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first month had passed in a blink of an eye, and the second was almost over as Ceria walked through the hallways of Wistram. She was looking for Pisces so they could get together and study after their class on enchantments. She passed by students and mages, nodding to some, smiling at others, wondering where Pisces had run off to.</p>
<p>This was Ceria’s life in her second year at Wistram. A lot had changed, but much had stayed the same. She still took classes, although they were harder, and she actively pestered Illphres every time she saw her. Being a second-year student only meant you studied more; a student was still a student and Ceria had already gotten used to classes and practicing spells day in and day out.</p>
<p>But one thing was different. Ceria found Pisces by following the excited voices. She heard a roar as she pushed her way through a crowd of students and saw Pisces, rapier in hand, pointing it at another young man who had both hands raised.</p>
<p>“My victory, Ramon.”</p>
<p>Pisces smiled at the third-year student. The other mage flushed bright red, but he reluctantly dropped the sword and wand in his hands.</p>
<p>“That was unfair! I never saw—”</p>
<p>“A victory’s a victory. Pay up.”</p>
<p>Pisces didn’t lower his rapier until Ramon tore a pouch from his belt and hurled it at him. The bag slowed in midair and Pisces snagged it. He sheathed his rapier with a flourish as the crowd began to break up. Ramon stomped away towards another group of Humans who glared at Ceria as she approached.</p>
<p>“Another duel? Dead gods, how many is that this week, Pisces? Six?”</p>
<p>“Eight, in fact. And you won’t believe how much I won this time. Six gold pieces and ten silver.”</p>
<p>Ceria whistled as she fell into step beside him. Pisces grinned widely as he added the coins to his bulging purse. He had come to this academy poor, but now he was rich in both coin and secrets.</p>
<p>“They must have been very certain they’d beat you this time. What did that Ramon fellow have? A wand?”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded.</p>
<p>“A dancing sword enchantment on one of the daggers and he had a wand with a frost spell attuned to it. He must have thought he could corner me with his sword, but he’s a poor fighter. It was a simple victory.”</p>
<p>“In that case, you’re paying for drinks tonight. Come on, I want to go over what we learned in class. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Pisces frowned as he stowed his money pouch at his side.</p>
<p>“Where? A library? I told you I prefer solitude. Our room are back that way, if you recall.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be stupid. Montressa invited us to her rooms, remember? And they’re a lot less messy than yours and far bigger than mine.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Of course.”</p>
<p>It was now Ceria and Pisces’ custom to study with Montressa if Calvaron and Beatrice were busy. And the two older students often were. Aside from their more difficult classes, the two were officially an item now, which came as no surprise to anyone that knew them. Calvaron’s obvious affection for Beatrice made Ceria sick sometimes; not the affection itself mind, but the lavish compliments he heaped on her every second.</p>
<p>Pisces sniffed as he adjusted his robes. Ceria eyed him as she walked.</p>
<p>“You need to wash your robes again, or learn a cleaning spell, Pisces. Dead gods, if you can learn [Invisibility] in one month you’d think you could look up [Cleanse] or something!”</p>
<p>He looked down at his robes with a frown.</p>
<p>“I don’t think they’re <em>that</em> dirty.”</p>
<p>“I can see stains all over them! Go buy some new ones—I’m sure Calvaron could find you some nice ones enchanted against messes.”</p>
<p>“I prefer to save my coin for more important things.”</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“Spellbooks, Springwalker, spellbooks. Even with what I can earn in duels, obtaining a new spellbook will be extremely expensive. I need to save all the secrets and coin I can. Why, a wand would set me back—”</p>
<p>“Just don’t be surprised if Montressa kicks you out of her room for being too messy.”</p>
<p>“She wouldn’t do that, surely?”</p>
<p>Pisces looked worried. Ceria paused.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think she would. She likes you, I think.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>He brightened. Ceria made a face at him.</p>
<p>“You can’t tell? It’s pretty obvious. And don’t tell me you haven’t seen Praemla making eyes at you in class.”</p>
<p>“Well, I—I might have seen, but you know—”</p>
<p>There was no accounting for taste. Pisces grew flustered as Ceria kept teasing him. He was fairly popular with the female sex it seemed, if only because he was a genius at magic. Ceria could only roll her eyes when someone brought Pisces up as a potential boyfriend. He was far too messy, distracted, and besides—</p>
<p>She poked him in the back. Pisces yelped and glared.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“There’s rat dropping on your robes, Pisces! How have you not cleared those things out yet?”</p>
<p>“As a matter of fact, those are <em>mice </em>droppings, Ceria. I happened to run across a few briefly earlier this week.”</p>
<p>“Again? Do you seek out rodents in your spare time or something?”</p>
<p>“I—”</p>
<p>He faltered. Ceria glanced sharply at him.</p>
<p>This is what was different. In the time since they had become second-year students, Pisces had made a name for himself with his prowess in magic and dueling. He could beat students with several years on him thanks to his talent with a rapier. But he was also rich in secrets.</p>
<p>Very rich. In fact, Ceria sometimes wondered if Pisces had more secrets than Calvaron. It certainly seemed like Pisces knew everything sometimes. People could be whispering in the halls and he’d somehow pick up on it.</p>
<p>Naturally, everyone suspected Pisces of mastering an advanced eavesdropping spell, but no one could tell when he was using it or which spell it was. More than once Ceria had seen other students casting [Detect Magic] to try and observe him using the spell, but so far they—and she—hadn’t been able to figure out how Pisces was doing it.</p>
<p>“Something on your mind?”</p>
<p>“A bit.”</p>
<p>He turned down a corridor and Ceria saw him whisper a standard ward against listening. He kept talking casually with her, as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>“You know, I’ve been meaning to speak with you, Ceria. There’s something I’d like to show you later.”</p>
<p>“Really? What?”</p>
<p>“A secret. A big one. Remember when we found the spellbook last year? Well—”</p>
<p>Pisces broke off and Ceria felt the ward around them vanish. He raised his voice and called out.</p>
<p>“Mons! Ah, good. We were just coming to see you.”</p>
<p>She hurried towards him, smiling widely, holding a stack of books in her arms. Ceria greeted Montressa and in a moment they were in her rooms.</p>
<p>Montressa had been given a large room—probably because her family had bought her way into Wistram. Ceria and Pisces sat at a wonderful table inlaid with ivory while they chatted in between periods of study.</p>
<p>“Did you go to Illphres again, Ceria? I can’t believe you stand outside her door every day!”</p>
<p>“It’s a habit. I think I’m getting to her—she’s started waking up earlier to try and avoid me.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see why she doesn’t turn you to ice. Everyone says she has a temper. She’s so scary!”</p>
<p>“Like I said, she likes me. And—uh, I think she might get in trouble if she does it. I hear she did it once and got in a lot of trouble with the Council. So I’m…probably…safe.”</p>
<p>“How many days has it been, Springwalker? Fifty six?”</p>
<p>“Yup. And I told you, stop calling me Springwalker, Pisces.”</p>
<p>He shrugged.</p>
<p>“As you wish. However, I must inquire. Isn’t there another mage with suitable qualifications that might serve as a master instead of Illphres?”</p>
<p>“There are. But they all already have apprentices or they’re like Illphres. I want a master who can teach me one-on-one, you know?”</p>
<p>Pisces and Montressa nodded. He frowned, tapping his fingers thoughtfully on the table.</p>
<p>“I support your efforts, but it would be prudent to have a fallback plan. Illphres is…”</p>
<p>“I know. If I can’t persuade her by the end of the year I’ll give up. Frankly, I hope I can get her to give in before that or passing the yearly tests is going to be tough.”</p>
<p>“Yearly tests? No one told me about yearly tests! I thought there were only the entrance exams for new students!”</p>
<p>Montressa sat up, looking alarmed. Pisces chuckled and waved a hand.</p>
<p>“You need not worry, Mons. You see, the yearly tests only apply to second-year students and beyond. And they’re not so much tests as…qualification exams.”</p>
<p>“That’s a test, Pisces.”</p>
<p>Ceria sighed and rubbed her head as she closed her spellbook. She tried to explain to Mons.</p>
<p>“You see, at the end of the year all mages have to prove they’ve learned something while studying at Wistram. It can be anything from a spell they’ve learned to reciting something they’ve studied or presenting something they’ve made—it’s just to prove they’re worth keeping. Otherwise the mage might be forced to pay to stay—it can be only a bit for food and lodging, or a lot if the mage is a lazy waste of space like Charles de Trevalier.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see.”</p>
<p>“Ceria doesn’t really need to worry that much, in truth, Mons. Second-year students don’t get tested nearly as harshly as older students like Calvaron and Beatrice.”</p>
<p>“That’s rich, coming from the mage who mastered [Invisibility] in one month.”</p>
<p>“Ah, well, all the better to spy with you see?”</p>
<p>“Just so long as you’re not caught peeping in any of the female student’s rooms, Pisces. I’ve heard some of them have learned anti-invisibility spells already.”</p>
<p>Pisces drew himself up indignantly.</p>
<p>“I would never stoop to such behavior! If you want to accuse anyone of voyeurism, try Quesm. You don’t think he’s taking scrying classes for purely academic reasons, do you?”</p>
<p>Both Mons and Ceria made noises of disgust. Talk turned back towards spells—this time on wards to prevent scrying and who might be willing to put them up in their rooms. Ceria never did get to ask what Pisces was going to say in the hallway, but she sometimes wondered if he would tell her.</p>
<p>She thought he would, eventually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There are more and more raids by pirates each week, it seems.”</p>
<p>Ceria pursued Illphres down the corridor. The mage ignored her. Doggedly, Ceria continued, trying to keep up a monologue.</p>
<p>“A lot of people think it’s the Drowned Men—not all of them obviously, but probably a few ships of them. They’re hitting all the major sailing routes, and some of the ships going to and from Wistram. Some nations have offered Wistram a reward if we destroy the ships. What do you think about that?”</p>
<p>“Pay for magic. That’s common. So what?”</p>
<p>“Well…I was thinking I might join in if the Council decides to send a hunting party. There’d probably be a lot of older students going, but it would be a good way to test my abilities in battle.”</p>
<p>Illphres turned her head to stare at Ceria.</p>
<p>“You? You wouldn’t last five minutes against a group of raiders.”</p>
<p>“Not by myself, but Wistram would hire a group of mercenaries and send a bunch of combat-capable students. Pisces said he might go. Calvaron and Beatrice wouldn’t, but it seems safe enough, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“Arrogance.”</p>
<p>That was Illphres’ only comment. She walked out of the corridor and Ceria had to shade her eyes as she stepped out into the light. She found herself on a large walkway directly over the ocean.</p>
<p>This part of the citadel hung out over the calm seas. Ceria wondered why Illphres had come here. She stared down queasily into the water below. They were quite a ways out over the ocean—magic enabled the walkway to stretch far further than normal architectural engineering could allow.</p>
<p>Illphres stopped at the edge of the walkway. It had no guard rails, and so the mage could stare down straight into churning surf. She turned and passed a hand over her face. She was smirking a bit as Ceria halted a few steps back.</p>
<p>“You aren’t going to follow me over here like always?”</p>
<p>“I uh, don’t like heights that much.”</p>
<p>“I thought half-Elves all swung around on branches and lived in trees.”</p>
<p>“No, no…we don’t do that.”</p>
<p>Ceria cursed as her stomach roiled. Illphres was clearly enjoying herself. How had she found out Ceria was afraid of heights?</p>
<p>“Looks like the secret I paid for is true. You hate heights.”</p>
<p>“I—it’s more that I’m afraid of falling. Why did you come here?”</p>
<p>Illphres gestured to the open air around Ceria. She stared hard at the half-Elf.</p>
<p>“Four months you’ve followed me around. It’s annoying and you won’t stop.”</p>
<p>Ceria swallowed hard.</p>
<p>“No, no I won’t. Look, I know you don’t want an apprentice, but I need a master and you’re—well, brilliant. Please, won’t you teach me? I learned so much from you last year.”</p>
<p>Illphres considered this. She passed a hand over her face and her smile was slight and mischievous this time.</p>
<p>“I might. That’s why I’m testing you today.”</p>
<p>“A test?”</p>
<p>Ceria’s ears perked up. She was going to be tested? She took a deep breath, hope fluttering in her chest.</p>
<p>“I’m willing to do whatever I need to.”</p>
<p>“Really? Good. In that case—jump.”</p>
<p>Illphres said the word lightly as she pointed down to the ocean below. Ceria’s heart stopped.</p>
<p>“Wait, what?”</p>
<p>“Jump. And I’ll make you my apprentice.”</p>
<p>For a few seconds Ceria stared at Illphres. The woman was smiling at her. Just smiling.</p>
<p>“No. Hell no. That’s stupid.”</p>
<p>“Oh? I thought you’d do anything.”</p>
<p>“I’m not an idiot. Who’d jump just because you said so?”</p>
<p>Ceria glared at Illphres. The woman looked amused. She shrugged and walked past Ceria.</p>
<p>“At least you’re a bit intelligent. I wouldn’t teach you if you did jump. Be careful not to slip.”</p>
<p>“Slip? What do you m—”</p>
<p>Ceria turned to walk after Illphres and her foot slipped on a patch of ice. It was practically frictionless, and as Ceria windmilled her arms desperately and stepped back to keep her balance, her other foot slipped on a <em>second </em>patch of ice.</p>
<p>Screaming, she fell off the walkway down towards the ocean below. It was a long, long drop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ceria, I really think you should stop. You did your best, but Illphres is never going to teach you.”</p>
<p>That was what Calvaron said to her the next day as Ceria sat at their table, sneezing and shivering. She’d survived the fall, but gotten a bad cold from treading the freezing water before someone had helped levitate her out. Given that it was mid-summer, she had Illphres to thank for that as well.</p>
<p>Glowering, Ceria shook her head and coughed hard. Her lungs felt full of phlegm and she resented the way all the other students leaned away from her when she did.</p>
<p>“I’m not gibing up. And why are you all hiding?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to get sick.”</p>
<p>Beatrice replied as she placed her head as far away from Ceria as possible. Pisces nodded. He turned to the young woman sitting beside him.</p>
<p>“Colds are impossible to cure with healing potions, Mons. You will note that Ceria remains this way even though she is in the capital of magic? The cold is so troublesome that the greatest of mages find themselves susceptible to it. It is simpler to let it run its course, but of course the risk of contagion from Ceria is—”</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>Ceria scowled at Pisces. She shivered; she still <em>felt </em>cold.</p>
<p>“Ib gonna make her teach me. I will.”</p>
<p>“Well, before you do that, would you mind convincing Pisces not to join the pirate hunting expedition? And removing yourself from the list as well?”</p>
<p>Calvaron snapped exasperatedly at the two. Beatrice nodded.</p>
<p>“It’s not safe. You shouldn’t go.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense. This is a prime opportunity.”</p>
<p>Pisces waved a hand airily.</p>
<p>“We have no less than <em>four</em> experienced captains with their own ships, each with a crew of capable fighters. And with over twenty of Wistram’s best students, we’ll be sure to find these pirates who have been preying on traffic and—”</p>
<p>“Get killed. Horribly. Or ransomed.”</p>
<p>Calvaron interrupted as he buttered a roll. Beatrice nodded her head with her hands.</p>
<p>“It’s dangerous.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense. You’re exaggerating things. Ceria and I will be paid handsomely—”</p>
<p>“If it’s so safe, why aren’t the mages doing it? Why leave it open to the students?”</p>
<p>The Centaur frowned at Pisces and Ceria. She coughed and replied.</p>
<p>“Because it’s boring? We’ll be days at sea and might not find them the first time. But it’s fine, really, Calvaron. We can handle ourselves.”</p>
<p>“I think you two shouldn’t go. I really do.”</p>
<p>Ceria just shook her head. Her mind was made up. Calvaron opened his mouth to argue again, and paused as something flickered and flew past his face. He raised a hand to bat at it, and stopped as he saw the shimmering, fiery insect that flew past him to hover in front of Ceria.</p>
<p>She smiled as she saw the firefly—a literal fly made of glowing lights—hovering in the air. It spread its wings wide and she saw symbols and shapes flickering in the air.</p>
<p>“Oh? Is this from you, Mons?”</p>
<p>“I did it! I think I figured out the spell!”</p>
<p>Sitting next to Pisces, Mons’ face lit up with excitement. Calvaron stared at the flying insect and the message only Ceria could read and frowned.</p>
<p>“What’s this, Ceria?”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded. He straightened in his chair importantly as he explained.</p>
<p>“It’s a new spell Ceria and I developed. It helps us communicate at range and no one’s been able to decipher the messages.”</p>
<p>“So far.”</p>
<p>Beatrice studied the glowing message carefully. Pisces smiled confidently at her.</p>
<p>“I am sure no one will be able to break this spell. It is many times more complex than any [Message] spell you could ever devise, and it can be used up to several miles away.”</p>
<p>“Handy. Will you teach us how to use it?”</p>
<p>“Maybe…but only if you stop trying to dissuade Ceria and I. Our minds are made up.”</p>
<p>Calvaron threw up his hands in disgust.</p>
<p>“It’s your funeral.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two weeks later, Illphres found herself sitting alone at a table in the banquet hall. That was unusual for her, and she couldn’t help feeling something was wrong. Only when she understood that it was because she was used to having Ceria talking to her and pestering her did Illphres realize what she was unconsciously missing.</p>
<p>She passed a hand over her face and let her features change into a scowl. The half-Elf was gone on her adventure chasing pirates, and good riddance. She was far too annoying anyways, and now Illphres could concentrate.</p>
<p>That didn’t improve her mood though, and neither did the tall Dullahan who pulled a chair up at the table with her. He was named Jurix, and he was part of her faction, the Isolationists. That didn’t stop her from glaring daggers at him.</p>
<p>Jurix raised his hands as he placed his head on the table across from her. Two plates of food and a cup floated down next to it. He ignored Illphres’ glare that told him to leave and began to talk to her, quite unperturbed. He was too cheerful for a Dullahan, which contrasted well with Illphres.</p>
<p>“Stop glaring, Illphres. We’re on the same side here. Or are you missing that half-Elf that kept following you around all the time?”</p>
<p>“I’m not missing her and she was a pest. What do you want, Jurix?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. I’m just here to tell you that Ophelia is on board. Totally.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Illphres passed a hand over her mouth, and she was smiling when she lowered it. This <em>was</em> good news. Jurix nodded, pausing to smile as he fed himself with a hovering spoon.</p>
<p>“That’s right. We’ve got four now; if we can get one more mage on our side I think we’ll have a shot.”</p>
<p>“I’ll talk to Amerys again.”</p>
<p>“Try not to start a fight?”</p>
<p>“No promises.”</p>
<p>Illphres, changed her features to a grin as she covered her mouth. She could have done it without covering her face; Jurix knew her secret. But she had grown used to doing it this way. She was about to ask Jurix what had changed Ophelia’s mind when someone began shouting a few tables over.</p>
<p>“What’s this now?”</p>
<p>Jurix frowned and picked up his head so he could see. Illphres turned and saw one of the mages shouting in panic as he raced into the room.</p>
<p>“It was a trap! They’re under attack!”</p>
<p>“Who are?”</p>
<p>Someone shouted, and Illphres looked towards the entrances to the banquet hall. She was expecting another loose experiment, or perhaps some of the undead from the catacombs under Wistram, but it seemed the issue didn’t lie within Wistram, but outside of it.</p>
<p>“The students! The hunting expedition we sent—it’s been ambushed! I just received a [Message] spell—there’s a fleet of nine ships attacking them! It’s not just a few isolated ships—it’s an entire armada!”</p>
<p>The banquet hall erupted into shouts at this news. Jurix turned to Illphres. Her expression hadn’t changed, but her eyes had locked onto the mage who had spoken.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that half-Elf with…?”</p>
<p>“Quiet.”</p>
<p>“The students say they’re outnumbered and the pirates have mages of their own! And their leader is far stronger than the [Captains]—he’s already slain two! Where’s Archmage Amerys? They need her!”</p>
<p>“She’s out hunting!”</p>
<p>The mage turned in desperation.</p>
<p>“One of the other Archmages, then! We need someone who can teleport or fly—if we don’t hurry the students will be dead!”</p>
<p>Jurix and Illphres saw the hall devolving into confusion. Some mages—those who could actually teleport—backed away, unwilling to expose themselves to danger. Wistram was full of mages, it was true, but only a fraction of their number was willing to go into combat.</p>
<p>For his part, the Dullahan stared hard at Illphres. She was seated, motionless in her chair. He knew she was thinking.</p>
<p>“Are you going to help?”</p>
<p>“She knew what she was getting into. All those students do. It isn’t our job to bail them out.”</p>
<p>“Very true. We should let them sort out their own problems. And if they can’t, well, that’s life.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. It’s not our problem.”</p>
<p>Jurix nodded understandingly. He reached for a plate, and stopped as Illphres stood up. She glared at him.</p>
<p>“Well? Are you coming?”</p>
<p>He grinned and pushed back his chair, already fastening his head securely to his neck.</p>
<p>“I’ll message Bastam and Ophelia. We’ll get her to teleport us, but it will take several leaps—”</p>
<p>“Hurry. I’ll go ahead. I’ll be faster.”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>Illphres strode away from Jurix. She saw heads turning towards her, but paid no attention. Students and mages cried out as ice spread in front of Illphres, but she just stepped forwards.</p>
<p>Her shoes were designed to stick to the ice, but only if she allowed them too. Illphres slid forwards on the ice, gathering momentum as she let the slick ice take her momentum. It spread across the banquet hall, making anyone standing on it slip or be forced to grab a table for support. Calvaron tumbled to the ground with a cry and Beatrice had to grab Mons to keep her upright as Illphres kicked herself across the ice, moving faster.</p>
<p>She shot down the banquet hall, smooth-soled shoes turning as she pivoted, zipping past a group of students. Illphres jumped and cleared the fallen Calvaron. She shot down a corridor and found herself headed at a wall.</p>
<p>Ice rose and curved. Illphres kicked off from one wall and shot up the ramp and onto the far wall. For a few seconds she was horizontal, skating on the far wall, then she dropped down to the ground and kept going, barely losing speed.</p>
<p>She didn’t know why she was doing this. Illphres ignored the shouting as her ice magic shot down the hallway, providing her with a passageway to keep skating down, moving faster and faster. There was no reward for this, at least none she cared for. She told herself real mages stood alone.</p>
<p>But she thought of Ceria. She scowled as she shot out Wistram’s front doors, blasting them open with a pillar of ice. Illphres felt herself falling, and gazed down at the steps as they came rushing towards her. The steps froze, and the ice turned the hill down towards the docks into a ramp. Illphres sped down it, gathering more speed. She created a ramp for herself at the end and flew out into the ocean, a missile.</p>
<p>Real mages stood alone. But the half-Elf wasn’t a real mage yet. And neither was Illphres.</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Get <em>down!</em>”</p>
<p>Ceria screamed as another volley of arrows flew overhead. Half of those who heard her threw themselves down, but the other half were too busy fighting to dodge. She heard screams as several arrows found their mark. One flashed past her head as she held still on the deck of the rocking ship.</p>
<p>As soon as she thought the worst of it was over Ceria was on her feet. She clutched at her arm; she’d been hit once already. The shaft stuck out of her flesh and Ceria felt faint.</p>
<p>But there was no time to rest or scream. The enemy was everywhere.</p>
<p>The deck of the ship she was on was filled with men and women with swords. Not just any men or women though; the Drowned People. They were a race created when parasites from the ocean fused with Humans or other species. Many were peaceful people, the products of an accident. But others were pirates.</p>
<p>And these were no ordinary raiders, no ragtag group of sea bandits. Someone had gotten their information very wrong, Ceria knew, because eight ships had ambushed the expedition from Wistram at sea. Now they swarmed the three remaining ships, wearing bright red bandanas. That way the archers on the other ships could avoid hitting their friends as they loosed arrows on the mages and mercenaries fighting for their lives.</p>
<p>At least the bandanas made them easy to hit. Ceria raised her hand and pointed three fingers at the nearest pirate.</p>
<p>“[<em>Ice Dart</em>]!”</p>
<p>Three shards caught the woman as she turned. Two bounced off the crustacean like shell on her chest, but the third hit her in the throat. She choked but didn’t fall. Ceria saw a mercenary turn and run her through—</p>
<p>“Ceria!”</p>
<p>She felt someone hit her from the side. Ceria fell and saw Pisces. He’d knocked her to the ground just in time to keep her from being run through by a man with a cutlass. He grinned and slashed fast at Pisces.</p>
<p>“[Flame Jet]!”</p>
<p>Ceria screamed the spell as she pointed her hands up. The man dodged back from the gout of flame with a curse and gasped as Pisces ran him through. The mage pulled his blade back with a grimace and helped Ceria to her feet.</p>
<p>“We have to run!”</p>
<p>He screamed it in her ears as he pointed to the side. Ceria dragged him back.</p>
<p>“We can’t jump! They’ll kill us in the water easily!”</p>
<p>“In that case—I’ll have to—”</p>
<p>He turned and swore.</p>
<p>“Look out! He’s coming again!”</p>
<p>Ceria turned and saw a ship shooting towards them, black hulled, the front reinforced with steel to create a ram.</p>
<p>The captain of these pirates stood at the head of the deck, grinning, bloody sword in hand. Ceria flinched as she saw him holding two heads. He’d already killed two of the [Captains] of the four ships and sunk one with his vessel. She braced as Pisces gripped the railing—</p>
<p>The impact splintered the hull of the vessel Ceria was standing on and threw her and Pisces apart. She got up groggily, and saw more pirates swinging down onto the deck, charging the outnumbered Wistram students and mercenaries.</p>
<p>Already half of the students had died. The rest fell back, fighting with spells but unable to defend themselves from the brutally efficient blades and arrows that assailed them. Ceria stumbled backwards, firing shards of ice desperately. It wasn’t supposed to be like this. They were supposed to be doing the hunting. They could have taken any equal force with their mages, but this—</p>
<p>Fire erupted to one side, burning a group of mercenaries as the pirates cheered. Ceria saw a mage – a man with red robes – standing on one of the far ships. They had mages of their own.</p>
<p>She was going to die here. Ceria backed towards her friends, fellow students, and the mercenaries who’d formed a desperate semicircle on their deck. This was it. The pirate captain led the charge and she fought for her life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Across the deck, Pisces found himself fighting for his life. He stepped backwards in a flash, parried a blade, and stepped again, thrusting desperately. But his opponent moved as fast as he did, perhaps faster.</p>
<p>“I have a Skill that’s a match for your spell, boy.”</p>
<p>The man who pushed Pisces backwards was no Drowned Man, but a Human, heavily tattooed on his face and arms. He cut at Pisces, making the mage duck and weave. Pisces muttered under his breath as he took five rapid steps backwards, flashing across the length of the deck.</p>
<p>“Rise, rise unto me—”</p>
<p>He cried out as the man cut his arm with a slash from his offhand. He had a dagger to match with his blade. Now the man stood, sword in one hand, dagger in the other. He beckoned with the dagger at Pisces, challenging.</p>
<p>“I see your bell. Shall we have a duel of it, mage from Wistram?”</p>
<p>Pisces grinned wildly as he cast a spell without words.</p>
<p>“If you want to try, be my guest.”</p>
<p>They spun away, each attempting to catch the other. Pisces leapt from the railing of his ship towards another one. He landed on the deck and the man followed, laughing. The pirates had butchered the crew of this ship and only the dead remained.</p>
<p>“Nowhere to run!”</p>
<p>“No. There isn’t.”</p>
<p>Pisces’ eyes glinted as something moved on the still deck. He brandished his rapier and circled the tattooed man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ceria saw Pisces jump, but she could do nothing to help him. She was fighting for her life. It seemed like there was a wall of blades around her. She expected at any moment to be run through, but fought for every second.</p>
<p>Two ships, now. The third was dead in the water, Pisces and the other pirate the only living souls aboard. Ceria saw the other ship approaching, and realized they were coming to help. But more pirate ships were all around, and they were trying to board the other ship. Ceria saw one ship coming dead on, attempting to ram—</p>
<p>“<em>To port! Hard port!</em>”</p>
<p>Someone screamed that. Ceria saw the pirate ship turn, but too slowly. She gaped as a huge blade of ice sudden crashed into the ship, a vertical guillotine that cut the entire vessel in two.</p>
<p>“<em>What was that?</em>”</p>
<p>The attackers stopped their assault as they turned to look. The pirate ship broke in two and began to sink. Ceria turned towards the railing and her heart stopped as she saw a familiar figure, skating across the waves.</p>
<p>Illphres. The ice mage froze the very sea around her as she dashed across the ocean. She moved faster than anything Ceria had ever seen on land, leaving a trail of disintegrating ice as she spun in the air and landed, skating backwards towards another vessel.</p>
<p>From her hands came ice, massive pillars of it that crashed into another pirate ship and broke the wooden hull. Illphres turned, and a wall of ice formed in front of her as one of the pirate mages blasted her. She raised a finger and hit him in the chest with a spike of ice.</p>
<p>“<em>Mage!</em>”</p>
<p>Ceria heard an incredible roar and turned to see the pirate leader. He was on his ship and it turned incredibly fast towards Illphres. Archers shot at her as she raised a second wall of ice to block them. Calmly, Illphres sent a second scything ice blade to cut apart the pirate leader’s ship.</p>
<p>The ice broke as it struck the hull of the black ship. Ceria, ducking back and throwing fire, saw Illphres pause and heard the captain roar.</p>
<p>“I sailed through storms that have sunk islands, mage! My ship and I are one! I am a [Storm Captain]! Come and fight me if you dare!”</p>
<p>Illphres raced towards him on the frozen sea. She leapt, and a pillar of ice threw her up onto the deck. Ceria cried out. It was a trap! There was no way Illphres could fight an entire crew of pirates and their captain alone. She leapt from the deck of the ship she was on and dove into the waters below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pisces remembered the past. With every step and thrust and dodge and parry, he remembered the lessons his father had taught him. His sword felt heavy in his hands, but he dared not stop moving.</p>
<p>“Tiring, mage? You have skill, but I have Skills.”</p>
<p>The tattooed pirate laughed at him as Pisces gasped for air. He was badly winded. Pisces knew he couldn’t continue. He stepped backwards, towards a place where the dead had been cut down in droves. The man advanced, laughing. He was coming for the finishing kill.</p>
<p>One slash nearly tore the rapier Pisces held out of his hands. The thrust with the dagger cut him across the ribs. Pisces hissed, and tripped backwards over a corpse. He raised his rapier as the man stepped over the body—</p>
<p>And it seized him by the leg. The pirate turned, stabbing at the man who rose from the ground.</p>
<p>“What is this?”</p>
<p>He was horrified to find the man who’d grabbed him was dead. The tears in his chest showed clearly where he’d been killed. But he still struck at the pirate, and another zombie grabbed him from the other side.</p>
<p>“Apologies.”</p>
<p>Pisces rose to his feet and lifted his rapier. The tattooed pirate stared at him with horror and fury.</p>
<p>“You coward! This is a duel!”</p>
<p>“Only to you.”</p>
<p>Pisces ran the tattooed man through. He turned, and took a deep breath. More pirates were coming, swinging onto the deck and stopping in horror when they realized who they were facing.</p>
<p>“<em>Necromancer!</em>”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes.”</p>
<p>Pisces stared sadly at the dead around him. They charged towards the living and he walked forwards, rapier in hand.</p>
<p>“I suppose there’s no hiding it now.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Illphres and the [Storm Captain] fought on the deck of his ship, exchanging blows. For Illphres, each spell was a spear of ice, or a storm of frozen daggers that cut down pirate after pirate, merciless, tearing holes in the deck of the ship. But the captain of the pirates dodged each spell, moving with effortless grace and speed on the rocking deck.</p>
<p>And he was strong, too. Each time Illphres raised a wall of ice to block him, he would swing past the wall of ice or shatter it with his enchanted blade. It could pierce her thickest barrier, and she didn’t have the time to fight him and the crew that assailed her from all sides.</p>
<p>He caught her as she froze a score of pirates around her. The captain kicked Ilphres off her feet. He tried to stab her through the chest as she lay on the ground, but she pointed and he dropped his sword, howling as it froze his skin.</p>
<p>He drew a dagger from his belt and threw himself at Illphres. She blasted him off his feet with a gust of frozen air, but he was back in a second. He raised his dagger with a yell—</p>
<p>And his foot came down on the patch of slick ice underfoot. Ceria shot an [Ice Dart] at the man’s head as she hauled her drenched body on the deck.</p>
<p>The captain’s boot landed on the ice and he turned and leaned out of the way of the shard of ice. He grinned as Ceria stared at him in dismay.</p>
<p>“On my ship, I cannot be tripped by air, water, or any other thing underfoot, girl.”</p>
<p>Then he turned and leapt out of the way. A flurry of [Ice Spikes] flashed past him, but each one missed. The [Storm Captain] lunged towards Illphres, and cut across her face.</p>
<p>Ceria screamed. But Illphres didn’t fall. Instead, her face fell to pieces. The [Storm Captain] froze as he stared at what remained and Illphres nodded.</p>
<p>“See what the face of a true mage looks like.”</p>
<p>Then the air froze. The deck froze. The captain raised his dagger and—</p>
<p>Froze.</p>
<p>Standing on the other side of the deck, Ceria felt the water on her freeze instantly. She cried out in pain and flailed about, hearing it crack. The cold was <em>intense. </em>She saw Illphres, kneeling on the deck.</p>
<p>“Illphres!”</p>
<p>It was minutes before the intense chill faded enough for Ceria to dash over to Illphres. She saw the woman kneeling on the deck, eyes closed, panting heavily. Ceria reached down to her, and froze.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Illphres looked up, staring at Ceria. Blackened lips moved, but the rest of her face stayed still. Her jaw, her nose—the entire lower half of her face was blackened, the skin dead. Ceria had seen such symptoms before. It was the look of frostbite.</p>
<p>“Do you see?”</p>
<p>Illphres whispered it to Ceria. The shards of ice that had been the—the mask on her face slowly began to melt as the temperature on the ship began to normalize. Ceria could only stare.</p>
<p>“This is what magic looks like.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re just in time by the looks of it.”</p>
<p>The three mages appeared in the air over the sea. They landed on the choppy water, staggering. Their feet met the surface of the water as if it were solid earth, but the constant movement of the waves still made it hard to stand. One of the mages, a woman with stitching around her hands, gasped for air as the other two caught her.</p>
<p>Jurix, the Dullahan and Bastam, the Drake, turned towards the ships where fighting still continued. Jurix pointed.</p>
<p>“There! Two ships are still active. A third is—”</p>
<p>“Are those zombies?”</p>
<p>Bastam stared intently at one of the ships. Jurix shook his head.</p>
<p>“Look later. I’ll take that ship, Bastam. You take that one.”</p>
<p>“Got it. Go.”</p>
<p>The Dullahan spoke a spell as Bastam began to chant.</p>
<p>“[Whirlwind Leap].”</p>
<p>He shot upwards, propelled by a massive gust of wind that hurled him towards the ship he had chosen. Jurix landed on the deck of one of the enemy ships and began casting spells at once. A trio of pirates rushed at him, but their blades scratched uselessly at his now-impervious armor. The Dullahan struck one with his palm.</p>
<p>“[Tremor Impact].”</p>
<p>The broken body of the Drowned Man flew far over the railing and splashed into the water below. The other pirates backed up, but Jurix pursued them, using [Flash Foot] to blink forwards and striking them with the same spell.</p>
<p>Caught by surprise, the pirates tried to swarm the ship Jurix was on. But one of their ships slowed as spells began to rain down from the sky upon it.</p>
<p>[Fireball] and [Lightning Bolt] spells struck the deck of the ship with deadly accuracy. Bastam, standing on the top of the ocean waves with Ophelia, hurled the spells hundreds of meters into the air, arcing them to hit the pirates on deck with deadly accuracy.</p>
<p>Three ships sunk and two more taken by the enemy, the pirates attempted to flee. Illphres sunk one by breaking the hull with [Glacial Spears]—the other two fell to combined attacks from the surviving mages.</p>
<p>And then it was over. Ceria stumbled across the deck of the deceased pirate captain’s ship as Illphres connected it to another ship with a bridge of ice. Ceria wanted to support Illphres; the woman stumbled twice as she walked, but the woman just shrugged her hands off.</p>
<p>“Leave me. Find your friend.”</p>
<p>Ceria hesitated, but then ran onto the other ship. She called out for Pisces, searching for him among the surviving mercenaries and student mages. Then she remembered he’d gone to the other ship.</p>
<p>“<em>Pisces!</em>”</p>
<p>The ship was full of people. How? Ceria shouted as the last surviving [Captain] turned his ship alongside the vessel. For a moment she thought one of the other ships had sent people to help Pisces fight, but then someone standing next to her cried out in horror.</p>
<p>“<em>Zombies!</em>”</p>
<p>They stood motionless on the deck, swaying slightly as the ship rocked back and forth. The undead. Some were mercenaries, others, Wistram students. More still were pirates, brought back from the dead after being slain. The ship was full of death.</p>
<p>And one living person. Pisces stood at the railing, a bloody rapier in hand. He was cut badly, but intact. He stared across the railing and then stared at the mercenaries and other mages. They all gazed at him, some vomiting, others backing away in fear.</p>
<p>Someone dropped a gangplank. Ceria saw Pisces step up. He walked across to her ship, and stopped in front of her. She just stared at him, not fully understanding. Not wanting to understand.</p>
<p>Pisces couldn’t meet her eyes. He cleared his throat, stared at the ground. He looked at Ceria at last, and there was guilt in his eyes.</p>
<p>“I wanted to tell you—”</p>
<p>Ceria took a step back. The corpses standing on the deck stared vacantly ahead. The head of one had been hacked nearly apart, but it stood, bits of gore and brain falling to the rocking deck. Illphres regarded Pisces silently as both sailors and the other students stared at him in horror.</p>
<p>But he only had eyes for Ceria. Pisces lowered his crimson rapier.</p>
<p>“Ceria—”</p>
<p>She backed away from him. Ceria felt weak. Her head was spinning. She took one more look at the undead that Pisces—her friend had created and threw up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Necromancer.”</p>
<p>It was the word on the tongues of every student and mage in Wistram. Even the dramatic battle at sea paled in comparison to the attention, anger, and hatred focused around one person.</p>
<p>Pisces. He stood in front of the Council, the assembly of mages presided over by the Archmages of Wistram, the body that governed the academy. Normally the Council voted on topics such as policy, Wistram’s stance towards nations, appointing new teachers, but it also served a rarely-fulfilled role as arbiter.</p>
<p>Standing on a balcony in the huge, circular room, Ceria stood next to Calvaron and Montressa as she stared down at Pisces, standing alone as he faced the Council. Beatrice had refused to attend the hearing. Or was it a trial? It felt like one.</p>
<p>The accusation was simple. Pisces was a [Necromancer]. It wasn’t as if Wistram had outlawed that school of magic explicitly—and yet, it was clear that they had. No sane mage practiced necromancy. It violated the dead. It was a tool used by crazed cults and madmen to create armies to assail the living.</p>
<p>It was wrong.</p>
<p>And yet Pisces stood in front of the Council and argued. Ceria heard his voice ringing through the chamber, confident, beseeching the other mages to understand. She stared at Montressa and saw the girl’s horrified face, and the grim look on Calvaron’s.</p>
<p>“Magic is pure! Necromancy is a force to be wielded for good or evil, not inherently biased in itself! And is Wistram not a place where all mages may study? Consider, I implore you, the case of Az’kerash! His name is infamous as the most powerful [Necromancer] of this millennium. He once studied here before he was slain on Izril. His sins are legion, that is undeniable—and yet, is he not an example to study and admire?”</p>
<p>Outrage. The rumble of voices in the room rose, but Pisces spoke over them.</p>
<p>“Yes, admire! I came here to follow in his footsteps, to see if anyone else understood necromancy as he did, or if he left anything behind. Az’kerash was evil, it is true, but he was also a master of magic! He gazed deeper into the heart of magic than any but the greatest [Archmages] before him. Is this not something we should accept? Necromancy is the equal of any other magical school!”</p>
<p>Mages sitting or standing around the room shouted at this, furiously denouncing Pisces. But he ignored them. His eyes were only for the Council. He spread his arms pleadingly.</p>
<p>“Wistram Academy is a place where the study of magic comes before all else. Before law, before morality or ethical concern. Here, magic is all. I came to study magic, to deepen my understanding of it. Wistram once held a single phrase to be true: ‘To ever strive’. I ask that you allow me to study, to be part of this institution and add to it as the one expert in my field. I have committed no crimes, despoiled no graves. I simply wish to learn.”</p>
<p>They debated. And argued. A few stood for Pisces. Amerys was one of them. But slowly, Ceria saw the Council and the opinion of the mages swing only one way. At the end of it, a man stood. He was old, one of the Archmages, and the only one besides Amerys that Ceria knew.</p>
<p>The half-Elf, the ancient mage who had represented Wistram for over a century. Archmage Feor. He stared down at Pisces and spoke quietly.</p>
<p>“Wistram will turn away no mage who seeks to learn and is worthy of it. But necromancy is not taught within these halls. It is not accepted. And if you choose to study here, Pisces, you will do so alone. We hereby revoke your scholarship. If you would stay, pay the full dues owed to the academy. Otherwise, you must leave. That is the decision of the Council.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pisces walked alone after that. He walked through hallways and rooms, but found no one who would speak with him. Some spat, others cursed him.</p>
<p>And when he found his friends, one would not stop to speak with him. Beatrice left. Montressa, Ceria, and Calvaron stayed, but all three looked at him as if he were different. Changed.</p>
<p>Evil.</p>
<p>“I have…one day to come up with the funds to pay Wistram. Or I must leave.”</p>
<p>Pisces’ voice shook with rage, pain, and anguish. Ceria wanted to hug him, but she couldn’t bring herself to. He was a [Necromancer]. He raised the dead.</p>
<p>It all added up. Already students were putting clues together. Someone had raided Pisces’ room, found the small army of undead mice he used to spy with. They had been burned, as had almost all of Pisces’ possessions.</p>
<p>“Do you have enough coin to pay? I know you had a lot saved up—”</p>
<p>Calvaron looked at Pisces with a trace of sympathy. Pisces shook his head roughly.</p>
<p>“Not—not enough. I need more, and a lot of it.”</p>
<p>“Well, I—I’m afraid I can’t lend it to you, Pisces. I could trade you secrets—and I’ll give you a good price for them—but I don’t think you have enough of those either.”</p>
<p>Calvaron didn’t meet Pisces’ gaze. Ceria didn’t look at him either. Montressa just stared at Pisces, as if she wasn’t sure who she was seeing.</p>
<p>“I know. I’ll trade you what I have. But I need more coin. So—this.”</p>
<p>Pisces fumbled for something at his side. Ceria saw him lift his rapier up. Calvaron froze as Pisces offered it to him.</p>
<p>“Would this be enough? If you sold it—it is worth a large sum to the right buyers. Is it enough?”</p>
<p>The rapier trembled in his hands, and the silver bell chimed once. Ceria stared at Pisces. Calvaron was silent for a long time before he replied.</p>
<p>“Enough to pay the academy’s fees? I can probably do that. But—are you sure?”</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<p>Pisces jerked his head. It could have been a nod. Calvaron stared at him, and then took the blade. Pisces stared at it, face white, and turned away. He stumbled as he walked out of the banquet hall.</p>
<p>No one went after him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was quiet when Ceria found Illphres. Somehow, the spirit of Wistram had been sucked out, or so she felt. Everything felt hollow, and empty. Even when she saw people laughing, it sounded fake and insincere.</p>
<p>The ice mage opened her door when Ceria called out. She admitted Ceria into her room and for the first time, Ceria saw the inside.</p>
<p>It was just a room. Cold, far colder than normal, but there was a bed and a bookshelf, and precious little else. Illphres only had time for magic.</p>
<p>The ice mage sat at a table with Ceria as the half-Elf shivered. Ceria couldn’t help but stare at Illphres’ mouth. The ice mage had restored her mask of ice, and her flesh looked healthy and normal. But now Ceria knew.</p>
<p>“You see, it’s why I have to alter my face to smile.”</p>
<p>Illphres showed Ceria, warping the ice around her face to change her expressions. The ice rippled and shifted unnaturally as Ceria watched, making her feel queasy.</p>
<p>“Far easier to hide it.”</p>
<p>The woman passed a hand over her lips and smiled bitterly. Ceria stared at her.</p>
<p>“Thank you for saving me.”</p>
<p>This was the first chance she’d had to say it. Illphres waved a hand over her face and changed it back to impassiveness.</p>
<p>“I suppose the fault is mine. I’m too soft-hearted.”</p>
<p>That made Ceria laugh. But that flash of humor was swallowed up by the hole in her heart. Illphres studied her.</p>
<p>“Your friend has upset the other mages. If he stays, he will only face their hostility. He will not be accepted here, not ever.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“Did you know he was a [Necromancer]?”</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>Ceria shuddered.</p>
<p>“If I had known—I think he wanted to tell me. But if I had known—!”</p>
<p>“You would have done what, stopped him? It is magic. He is a mage.”</p>
<p>“You think it’s okay?”</p>
<p>Ceria stared at Illphres in horror. She could still see the lifeless eyes of the dead people Pisces had brought back. Dead, and yet moving. Far worse than a golem; someone who had been alive once, forced to shamble about. Illphres just shrugged.</p>
<p>“It is magic. In his own way, your friend Pisces aspires to be what I yearn to be as well. A true mage. And you want the same thing, unless I am mistaken.”</p>
<p>“I do. But Pisces—I’m not the same as him.”</p>
<p>“He is a mage. And you are a mage. And I…I am a mage. But none of us are true mages. Not yet. I lost to that pirate captain. If you hadn’t bought me time to cast that spell, I would have died.”</p>
<p>Illphres said it matter-of-factly. Ceria nodded.</p>
<p>“But you saved me. You did what I never could. You’re a better mage than I am.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I am.”</p>
<p>The two sat in silence for a while. At last, Ceria asked the question, knowing the answer.</p>
<p>“Will you teach me magic?”</p>
<p>Illphres paused.</p>
<p>“Yes. If you truly wish it.”</p>
<p>It was the answer Ceria had been waiting half a year to hear. But it filled her with nothing. She looked down at her hands.</p>
<p>“Is it really okay? Is Pisces really…”</p>
<p>“The mages here would say one thing. I say another. Follow me and become a true mage. Then you will know the answer.”</p>
<p>Illphres held out a hand and Ceria stared at it. She looked at the woman, the mage, who hid her pain behind a mask of ice. She thought of her friend, who had hid behind lies. The person she barely knew. She saw what magic looked like, what it truly looked like.</p>
<p>Slowly, Ceria reached out and took Illphres’ hand.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On a controversial report published by one of the foremost [Emissaries], Trixal Therest in the year 2 EL.R, he listed Wistram as one of the most powerful factions in the world. Trixal’s report was issued to one of the Great Companies of Baleros who had hired him to write the primer, but it soon became widely disseminated across the world.</p>
<p>Other [Historians], [Diplomats], and other notable cosmopolitans soon voiced their outrage over Trixal’s report, which was claimed to be inaccurate and grossly misleading not to mention biased. However, while many charges were leveled at the characterization of other world powers, no words were spoken against Wistram’s position. For Wistram was an undisputed world power, if an often quiet one.</p>
<p>Mages. They worked for lots of gold and sometimes caused trouble, but they were indispensable. Of course, any organization that trained young spellcasters could be a threat, and other nations competed with each other to create their own institutions of magic now and then. But Wistram was safe from such politics, or indeed most wars due to its famed neutrality.</p>
<p>If the mages of Wistram did take part in a war, it was by declining to provide services, boycotting specific groups or countries, and so on. Few times in recorded history did mages fight on battlefields against a specific kingdom or empire. When mages did take to the field in numbers, it was against common enemies such as the Demonfolk of Rhir, or against a Goblin King or similar calamity.</p>
<p>Still, were it not for the benefits Wistram provided to all, it surely would have been taken over by one nation or other over the countless years it had existed. Wistram occupied a central point for all ships crossing the ocean, providing them with a place to trade, sell, and resupply. Yet few armies had ever taken Wistram by force, and none had ever breached the gates since the Golems of Archmage Zelkyr had been created to protect the isle.</p>
<p>But what kept Wistram alive? Trade was only a part of the mage’s economy, and that by itself would not allow mages to live in such splendor. No, it was the unparalleled quality of their education. A mage may be made of any fool with a basic grasp of magic, but of Wistram mages, it was said that the weakest of them was a match for any Silver-rank adventurer.</p>
<p>And that was broadly correct. A mage passed by Wistram was almost always a studied graduate of at least six years, capable of casting many spells and studied in a wide variety of fields. She or he or they owed it all to the rigorous training given to them by their teachers, older mages who imparted their knowledge to the new students.</p>
<p>That was the true value of Wistram. Its teachers. Each one defined the experience the students would go through year to year, and so it was small wonder the students quickly learned which teachers could be appeased, which ones were competent and which were barely able to convey their subject matter and of course, which ones were to be feared.</p>
<p>The teacher for basic combat magic this year was not happy. Few teachers saddled with the job were. Teaching magic to the newest students, those that had passed their entrance exams, was not an easy job, and the salary provided by the council was meager. It was a task mages fought to avoid.</p>
<p>Perhaps that was why this mage was angry. Then again, it could have just been her personality. All the new students knew was that their teacher was as terrifying as she was good at ice magic. And whenever they saw her in the hallways, or now, entering the banquet hall for breakfast, they took care to greet her deferentially while clearing a path.</p>
<p>“Good morning, professor.”</p>
<p>“Hello, professor.”</p>
<p>It was a title of respect. And fear. The students backed away from their magic teacher, letting her select her food and pile it onto a plate before moving away to their collective relief. The teacher stalked away towards a far table, face frozen with a hostility that her students had grown to dread.</p>
<p>“Hoi, teacher! Over here!”</p>
<p>Someone waved to her. The mage turned. Her face changed little, but she scowled as she sat down with a few other mages for breakfast. One of them grinned at her.</p>
<p>“Hi there. How’s it going, professor Ceria?”</p>
<p>Calvaron stared at Ceria Springwalker’s glaring face for a few more seconds and then burst out laughing. He howled with mirth as he pounded the table Beatrice and Mons sat at. Ceria kept glaring until the Centaur had finished.</p>
<p>“You done? Because if you’re not, I’ll shove an icicle so far up your—”</p>
<p>“Whoa there, don’t take it out on me! Please, professor, show mercy!”</p>
<p>The Centaur raised his hands in mock fright. He grinned at Ceria, still sniggering at her. She wanted to throw her plate at him, but it wouldn’t be worth it. Calvaron had been laughing about the title her students had given her since the year had started. She growled as she cut into the steak slathered with butter on her plate.</p>
<p>“I keep telling them <em>not</em> to call me that.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but you know students. They have to have a nickname for their teachers, and I think ‘professor’ suits you quite well. Don’t you, Beatrice?”</p>
<p>The Dullahan looked up from her plate and nodded her head with her hands. She had a book open by her head and was alternating between staring at that and nibbling on cheese.</p>
<p>“It’s a better name than Scaleslough. That’s what they called our old teacher.”</p>
<p>“Dead gods, I’d forgotten! We used to call old Tshya that all the time! That brings back memories.”</p>
<p>The Centaur smiled at the memory, but Beatrice did not. She looked at Ceria.</p>
<p>“How are classes going?”</p>
<p>“How do you expect? Badly.”</p>
<p>Ceria made a face as she forked a dripping piece of meat into her mouth. She wanted to grimace, but the hot meat made her too happy to properly grouch. Instead, she only sighed, sipping at the sweet juice in her cup as she stretched out on the comfy cushioned seats she’d grown used to.</p>
<p>“All these new students don’t know the difference between a fire spell and a water one, I swear. Their magical composition is terrible, they can’t compress their mana correctly, their aim is so bad I have to put up a ward or they’ll hit each other—”</p>
<p>The half-Elf broke off, affronted as Calvaron <em>and </em>Beatrice laughed at this. Mons had to smile too, although she tried to look away from Ceria. Ceria growled as she eyed her friends.</p>
<p>“What’s so funny?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, Ceria. It’s just that—every teacher always says the same thing about their students.”</p>
<p>Calvaron chuckled as he explained.</p>
<p>“All the mages who have to teach say it. And all of the older students say it too. Why, not two years ago I heard all the older mages saying it about your year.”</p>
<p>“They did not.”</p>
<p>Beatrice nodded, smiling.</p>
<p>“Did too. And now you’re saying it. It’s funny.”</p>
<p>Ceria turned her head to stare at Montressa. The younger girl turned red, but she grinned sheepishly at Ceria.</p>
<p>“Calvaron and Beatrice said you’d complain, Ceria. But it’s a good thing you do, isn’t it? It means you care about your students.”</p>
<p>“Well…I’m their teacher. I have to care.”</p>
<p>Ceria hunched her shoulders defensively. Calvaron wagged his finger at her.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah. Don’t be modest, Ceria. I hear good things about your class. You may torture your students—”</p>
<p>“I do <em>not—</em>”</p>
<p>“—torture them with lessons harder than all the rest of their classes combined, but they’re learning a lot from you. The students can tell, for all they think you’re the scariest half-Elf they’ve ever met. You’re doing a good job.”</p>
<p>“Well.”</p>
<p>Ceria couldn’t think of anything to say in reply. She tried not to blush, but knew her ears had turned slightly red.</p>
<p>“It’s just a job. I didn’t want it. It’s a pain and it’s keeping me from studying—anyways, it’s fine. What about you three? I’ve been so busy I haven’t had time to catch up with you all this year.”</p>
<p>The other students sitting at Ceria’s table shrugged. She eyed Calvaron and Beatrice, largely unchanged since she’d gotten to know them. The only real difference was that Calvaron was a bit heavier, having gained weight, and Beatrice had upgraded her plain metal armor with a new coat of paint and what looked like steel mixed in with the common iron.</p>
<p>They had grown. But so had Mons, and in far more dramatic ways than the other two. In the year after the infamous day when Ceria had been caught up in a battle at sea with a powerful pirate navy, the young girl had turned into a young woman.</p>
<p>Humans grew up so fast. In one year, Mons had finished most of her adolescence and become, well, as physically old as Ceria. She had grown two inches taller, and her hair had gotten longer. Her breasts were a bit bigger, she had a bit more muscle, and she was more confident than the girl Ceria had met.</p>
<p>Now Mons smiled at Ceria, the depths of her pale saffron-topaz irises glinting in the morning light. She looked rather strange to Ceria, with her red hair and bright eyes. Half-Elves didn’t have naturally red hair. Staring at her now, the half-Elf felt a pang in her chest. In one year, Ceria had barely changed, but Mons had transformed. How much different would she become by the time Ceria graduated?</p>
<p>“And you, Mons? How are classes in the second year?”</p>
<p>“Good! I’m really enjoying my classes on ward spells. I don’t know why, but I’ve got a real knack for casting them. I’ve gotten a Skill – [Layered Ward]! I think I could really specialize in that field!”</p>
<p>“That’s great news, Mons.”</p>
<p>Ceria smiled at the young woman while Calvaron and Beatrice made similar complimentary noises.</p>
<p>“You never told me you got a Skill, Mons! When was this?”</p>
<p>“Last week. And I told Beatrice, but I didn’t tell you because she said you’d just sell the secret to someone.”</p>
<p>Mons’ eyes twinkled as Calvaron spluttered and turned red. Ceria laughed.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m glad you’ve learned how to put Calvaron in his place. I thought you’d be in real trouble with me gone.”</p>
<p>“It’s not been the same without you, Ceria.”</p>
<p>Calvaron sighed and shook his head.</p>
<p>“Mons and Beatrice try, but no one has your sharp tongue—or penchant for kicking and throwing things at people. I keep telling them, only you can kick like a real Centaur.”</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m serious. Ever since you went off and had to become Illphres’ apprentice, things have been so lonely. How could you just abandon us like that?”</p>
<p>“You’re disgusting. Didn’t you win a bundle for betting I’d be able to do it when everyone said I didn’t have a chance?”</p>
<p>“Of course. But that’s that and this is this.”</p>
<p>Calvaron smiled smugly, causing Ceria to flick her fingers and spray a cloud of snow in his face. He yelped as the freezing snowflakes melted on his fur.</p>
<p>“Aah! That’s the Ceria I know and love!”</p>
<p>She had to laugh at that. Ceria eyed Calvaron as she finished her food. He really hadn’t changed much. And yet, she knew he had taken his own steps towards becoming a mage over the year.</p>
<p>“How’s your own work going, Calvaron? You’re in your sixth year, now. One more and you’ll be able to call yourself a mage. Excited?”</p>
<p>“Hah. Terrified is more like. I’m practicing my tail off for the exam, but really, I’m more worried about collecting secrets and coin right now.”</p>
<p>Calvaron flicked his fingers, making the water on his face and arms vanish in a puff.</p>
<p>“Being a mage means I’ll really get embroiled in faction politics. I want the coin and secrets to, well, keep doing as I’ve done. I figure that without classes, I’ll be able to establish myself as a really influential broker between all the sides in Wistram.”</p>
<p>“Or you could take one and keep studying instead.”</p>
<p>Beatrice turned her head to frown at Calvaron. He avoided her gaze and Ceria sighed. She knew he and Beatrice had been fighting about his future. Calvaron was content to earn a living and continue being the affable Centaur everyone went to when they wanted to sell or buy things, but Beatrice wanted him to join her faction, the Revivalists.</p>
<p>It was an argument Ceria wanted no part of, so she sat back as Calvaron cleared his throat awkwardly.</p>
<p>“I’m…not interested in their goals, you know that, Beatrice. I support some of their agendas, but other things they say—I can’t. Anyways, I need to be neutral. You know that.”</p>
<p>She said nothing, just narrowed her eyes. To break the tension, Mons turned brightly to Ceria.</p>
<p>“So, um, Ceria. How are things between you and Pisces? Have you seen him around?”</p>
<p>The mood at the table—froze. Beatrice turned the head in her hands to stare at Mons and the girl flinched. Calvaron covered his face with his hand and Ceria stopped eating.</p>
<p>“I haven’t seen him around recently.”</p>
<p>“Neither have I. I suppose he’s studying quite a lot. But you know, that’s how it is. We’re so busy studying—Ceria, how are lessons with Illphres going? Does she expect as much from you as you do from your students?”</p>
<p>Mons ignored Calvaron’s desperate attempt to shift the conversation. She stared at Ceria.</p>
<p>“I spoke with him the other day. He was teaching me about how to use the [Flame Arrow] spell more effectively.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>Ceria looked at Mons, surprised.</p>
<p>“You still…keep in touch with him?”</p>
<p>“I see him at least once or twice a week. He’s busy—studying—a lot, but he could use some visitors. I think it might be good if you talked with him.”</p>
<p>Mons met Ceria’s eyes squarely. The half-Elf didn’t know what to say. Across the table, Calvaron fiddled with his fork and Beatrice turned her head back to her spellbook without a word.</p>
<p>“I’ll—think about it.”</p>
<p>That was all Ceria could come up with. Mons nodded, and the table fell into a deep silence.</p>
<p>Even after a year, there was one word, one name that couldn’t be spoken aloud.</p>
<p>Pisces.</p>
<p>Ceria closed her eyes and pushed her plate back a bit, no longer hungry anymore. Even now, after so many months—</p>
<p>It still hurt. It still made her stomach churn.</p>
<p>Pisces was a [Necromancer].</p>
<p>The entire academy knew about it, now. The new students learned this fact within days of arriving. There was a necromancer studying among them. A twisted, deranged madman who experimented with the dead.</p>
<p>What could be more abhorrent? What could be more wrong? Necromancers had existed since the dawn of magic, but today they were shunned and feared. Famous examples among their kind had been used to haunt children’s dreams for generations, and the tale of Az’kerash, the horror that had brought death to two continents for over a century before being slain, still lurked in everyone’s memory.</p>
<p>Necromancy was evil. Few species could look into the rotting, dead eyes of a corpse and see anything but wrongness there. Perhaps the Selphid students sympathized with Pisces, and maybe there were those who quietly thought he did nothing wrong. But they were silent and the rest of the academy turned their backs on him.</p>
<p>Including Beatrice. The first time he had come to sit with them after his trial she’d nearly attacked him herself. Calvaron had—he hadn’t attacked Pisces, but neither could he look the young man in the eye. Ceria couldn’t either. Only Mons had stayed by Pisces’ side.</p>
<p>“Do that.”</p>
<p>The young woman nodded to Ceria, looking around the table seriously. She still trusted Pisces, still talked with him. Ceria could understand—but not condone.</p>
<p>He raised the dead. If she came to grips with that, he had still lied to her about who he was. She’d known him for over a year and he’d lied to her.</p>
<p>“Well, I think I’m ready for an after-breakfast dessert. Anyone want something?”</p>
<p>Calvaron heaved himself up and Beatrice caught at his arm.</p>
<p>“You’ll get fatter. Don’t eat.”</p>
<p>“<em>Beatrice—</em>”</p>
<p>“Actually, before you go Calvaron, I did have some business to discuss with you.”</p>
<p>Ceria interrupted the upcoming squabble. She saw Calvaron brighten as he looked at her and saw Beatrice’s smile of gratitude. Ceria tilted her head slightly as Calvaron sank back down.</p>
<p>“I’m always willing to help a friend out! What did you need, Ceria?”</p>
<p>“A ring or amulet with enchantments that resist ice and cold temperatures. I need good stuff, Calvaron. Not a shoddy spell, but one with the best binding available—something I could use if I had other enchanted items on me.”</p>
<p>Calvaron’s eyebrows raised.</p>
<p>“You need cold resistant magic? What, Illphres is too chilly for you?”</p>
<p>Ceria scowled at him.</p>
<p>“I need what I need, Calvaron. The question is, can <em>you</em> get it for me?”</p>
<p>He looked affronted.</p>
<p>“Of course I can! But it’ll be very expensive, you know that Ceria.”</p>
<p>“Price is no object. The highest-grade enchantments you can get, Calvaron, so long as they have no magical leakage. And I’ll need two of them.”</p>
<p>“Two? What for?”</p>
<p>Calvaron was alight with curiosity, but Ceria clamped her lips shut. She wagged a finger at him.</p>
<p>“Ask me no questions and I…won’t freeze your face off.”</p>
<p>“Ooh. I’m so tempted but—very well. I’ll ask around. You’re sure two? And you’re good for—alright, alright, I trust you! Talk to me in a week or two and I’ll let you know what I find. Okay?”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Calvaron.”</p>
<p>Ceria smiled and stood up. Beatrice looked surprised.</p>
<p>“Going so soon?”</p>
<p>“I’ve got to. Sorry. Illphres doesn’t have that much time and I have classes to prepare for—you know how it is.”</p>
<p>“Well then, stop by another time Ceria. You know where to find us!”</p>
<p>“Will do. See you Calvaron, Mons. Beatrice.”</p>
<p>Ceria waved and walked away. She levitated her plates into a wicker bin designed to hold them—a new addition to the banquet hall after the [Chefs] complained they were running out of dishes since students would pile them up ten feet into the air rather than send them into the kitchen—and walked out of the banquet hall.</p>
<p>By now, Ceria knew most of the academy back to front. The only places she hadn’t gone were the highest levels and deep into the bowels of the academy. It was still dangerous to wander in those places incautiously, but Ceria knew all the best shortcuts everywhere else.</p>
<p>So in less than five minutes, she was standing outside a door from which cold emanated. Ceria rapped on the frozen surface, ignoring the chill that made other students and mages hurry past her. She’d long since learned several spells to help with the cold.</p>
<p>After a moment, the door opened. A woman walked out. She nodded to Ceria—Ceria nodded back.</p>
<p>“You have eaten?”</p>
<p>“Just now. Do you want to have breakfast first or—?”</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Illphres walked down the corridor slowly. Ceria followed. Her relationship with her master, Illphres, was a simple one. Illphres ordered and Ceria usually obeyed. They didn’t waste time with greetings or chitchat, mainly because Illphres had no tolerance for it.</p>
<p>“Hey master.”</p>
<p>“Don’t call me that.”</p>
<p>Illphres turned and scowled at Ceria. The half-Elf took the glare unfazed.</p>
<p>“I get called ‘Professor Springwalker’ because of you. If I get called names, so do you.”</p>
<p>Illphres paused. She moved her hand past her mouth, and when she lowered it, she was smiling.</p>
<p>“They call you that? Hah.”</p>
<p>“It’s your fault.”</p>
<p>Ceria scowled as the woman turned and kept walking slowly down the corridors. Illphres just shrugged.</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“Most masters don’t make their apprentices teach their classes for them.”</p>
<p>“They should. It’s convenient.”</p>
<p>Ceria glowered. That was the thing about Illphres. She didn’t care at all about your feelings, and in fact seemed to delight in annoying other people.</p>
<p>And she usually came up with inventive ways to do it. Not that she’d deliberately gotten herself a teaching position for another year on purpose—that was just politics. But it had definitely been Illphres’ idea to make Ceria do the teaching instead.</p>
<p>Most masters made their apprentices get them food, or clean their rooms, organize their notes, assist with spellcasting and so on. But Illphres hated for anyone to do any of that for her—she wouldn’t let Ceria pull her seat out for her. And yet, she had no problems ordering Ceria to spend half her day teaching and preparing her next lesson for students when it suited her.</p>
<p>“I’ve barely had time to practice with all my lessons, you know.”</p>
<p>“But you <em>do</em> practice, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>“Hmm. We’ll see.”</p>
<p>Illphres led Ceria to a well-used set of rooms, looking at glowing stones on the doors until she found one that wasn’t lit.</p>
<p>“In here.”</p>
<p>They entered into the practice room. It was just an empty room, really. Some had furniture or other objects that could be used for magic practice, but most were just empty. This one had a white marble floor—enchanted of course, to protect against the spells mages would test in here.</p>
<p>Illphres paused in the center of the room and turned to face Ceria.</p>
<p>“Now, attack me.”</p>
<p>There was no warm up, no preamble. Ceria just raised her finger and started casting magic.</p>
<p>“[Ice Dart]! [Ice Spike]! [Frost Arrows]!”</p>
<p>The spells shot from her fingers in the form of deadly shards of ice, some as long as Ceria’s forearm and twice as wide. They shattered harmlessly on the sheets of thick ice that had materialized in front of Illphres. The woman let the slabs of ice hover around her, creating a multi-layered shield Ceria strove to break.</p>
<p>Her [Ice Dart] spell did little to the thick ice, for all it was a rain of projectiles. Ceria’s newly learned [Ice Spike] spell created a few cracks, but the heavier shots didn’t do much. And her final spell, a storm of fourteen arrows that shattered against the ice barrier and left Ceria gasping for air—did nothing.</p>
<p>“All done?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Ceria gasped for air and wiped at her brow, despite the chill in the air. Illphres let the icy barrier around her dissipate, the ice melting into water which vanished, and nodded.</p>
<p>“Not bad. If you ignore the fact that you’d be dead if any of your opponents knew magic of their own or had a bow.”</p>
<p>That stung. Ceria looked up, glowering at Illphres.</p>
<p>“Most students my year can’t cast a Tier 3 spell half as many times as I can! My offense is fine—”</p>
<p>“But your defense is terrible. Why didn’t you raise [Barrier of the Winds] before casting?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know it yet. You’re the one who told me to focus on ice magic! Why don’t you teach me [Frozen Shield] instead?”</p>
<p>Illphres’ face didn’t change, but the tone of her voice was definitely a sneer.</p>
<p>“Bah. [Frozen Shield] is a terrible spell. Just buy a real shield if you want to block something. You’ll be better off learning [Wall of Ice] when you’re at a higher level.”</p>
<p>The two mages continued to argue as Ceria and Illphres took a position facing the far wall. Illphres made colored targets of ice appear and Ceria hit them, Illphres correcting her as they bickered.</p>
<p>“Don’t I get a say in what I learn?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. You’re an idiot whereas I know what spells are best. Your [Ice Spike] spell is flawed—see there? Correct it.”</p>
<p>Ceria gritted her teeth as she did.</p>
<p>“Why won’t you teach me more advanced spells? I want to learn more, not keep practicing one spell over and over!”</p>
<p>“Mastery of the [Ice Spike] spell is key to learning the [Glacial Spear] spell. Besides, you don’t need variety—you need to perfect the basics first.”</p>
<p>Ceria grumbled under her breath and her ears drooped, but she finished practicing without any more complaints. Illphres was an excellent teacher even if she taught in much the same style as her element. Slowly, exactingly, choosing to perfect every spell before moving on to the next one. Still, Ceria couldn’t complain. She had an excellent teacher. Although she sometimes wondered…</p>
<p>As Illphres was walking towards the door without a word of goodbye, Ceria called out.</p>
<p>“Master.”</p>
<p>“Call me that again and I’ll freeze your toes off.”</p>
<p>Illphres turned, her face a scowl. Ceria shrugged insolently.</p>
<p>“…Master, <em>why</em> do you need two enchanted items to protect against the cold? I know it’s not for me.”</p>
<p>The ice mage scowled deeper, reshaping the ice mask on her face to do so.</p>
<p>“Of course it’s not for <em>you.</em> If you couldn’t handle my cold spells by now I’d have gotten rid of you already.”</p>
<p>“Then who <em>is</em> it for? I talked to Calvaron, but he says it’ll be a week or two before he can find anything.”</p>
<p>Illphres hesitated. Ceria waited, hoping she would get an actual reply. Illphres’ eyes pierced her apprentice, and she seemed to come to a conclusion.</p>
<p>“Maybe you’re ready. But—”</p>
<p>She glanced around the empty room meaningfully. There was no one to listen in, but Ceria knew that an eavesdropping spell might not be detectable even if they cast [Detect Magic].</p>
<p>“I will tell you later.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded and asked no more. She felt happy Illphres was willing to confide in her. Usually the woman just gave her orders and suffered no question. But perhaps she was trusting Ceria more? They’d been master and apprentice for over half a year now, and Ceria felt like she knew Illphres almost as well as anyone in the academy.</p>
<p>Drained from her practice session with the woman, Ceria exited the practice room, walking slowly down the hallways. She did not walk back towards Illphres’ room where she now had her own quarters. Instead, Ceria took a familiar route, one she hadn’t used in a long time. She walked down to the first level, and soon found herself standing next to a familiar door.</p>
<p>Pisces still lived in the same room he had when they were first-year students. He had no master. Ceria knew the room she had used to live in—and indeed, most of the rooms around his—were empty.</p>
<p>She stared for a long time at the door. Thinking. At last, she raised her hand to knock. Ceria hesitated.</p>
<p>Then she turned and walked slowly away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ceria had no intention of talking to Pisces. It wasn’t that she couldn’t handle the meeting, it was just that she didn’t want to speak with him. But fate conspired against her, or perhaps it was the finite amount of space even in a place as large as Wistram.</p>
<p>About a month later, Ceria found a knot of students and raised voices that was the sure sign of a duel, either magical or verbal, going on in one of the hallways. Pushing her way into the group, Ceria saw the duel was of the latter kind, and going on between a fourth-year student and—</p>
<p>Pisces.</p>
<p>Ceria’s heart skipped a beat when she saw him. Pisces was standing across from his opponent in a ring of bodies, speaking loudly. He had changed much since she’d seen him last.</p>
<p>Gone were Pisces’ rapier and the silver bell. It now belonged to Timor du Havrington, Ceria knew. And gone was Pisces’ smile, and indeed his normally semi-neat appearance.</p>
<p>Now his robes were dirty, a sign that he had little time or inclination to clean. They looked slept in, and ragged. Pisces had no coin to buy new ones. Ceria listened as the other student, a loudly-speaking cross between a dog and man—one of the Beastkin—concluded his point.</p>
<p>“—and so your foul practice drags down the status of mages everywhere. No nation respects a [Necromancer], and thus, why should Wistram? Why should we condone a school of magic condemned by the entire world?”</p>
<p>A murmur of agreement ran through the students listening to the debate. Ceria saw Pisces draw himself up. His posture was different. He hunched his shoulders more, and glared at his opponent as he sniffed and launched his counter argument.</p>
<p>“Necromancers have no place in the world? Who decides such things? Popular opinion? If that is the case, I must inquire, what of Archmage Nekhret? Was she undeserving of her title despite being tainted, as you seem to insinuate, by the foul practice of necromancy? She was a true [Archmage], not some pretender to the class! She represented the soul of Wistram over a thousand years ago—her bones still lie in the catacombs below the academy itself!”</p>
<p>“She lived over a thousand years ago!”</p>
<p>“Age is immaterial! My point is that she was an Archmage, someone who represented Wistram. Should she be condemned? No—more broadly speaking, can any group of mages be condemned for the actions of a few? I put to you, what about the actions of the infamous Burning Killer, Calico, who was just caught and executed in Chandrar? Do his actions define mages as a whole? Should we look askance at every [Pyromancer] because of him? Let me ask to you this question—”</p>
<p>As she watched, Ceria knew Pisces would lose. His arguments were sound, but he had lost his audience, probably before the debate had begun. When they voted, the group of students chosen to listen to the debate all voted unanimously. Pisces had lost, and so the winner collected his spoils—a small bag that might have had coin or something else—and walked away without another word.</p>
<p>The students dispersed, leaving Pisces to stare murderously at the ground. Ceria approached half-unwillingly. She hesitated before she spoke, but she did speak.</p>
<p>“I hope you didn’t bet anything valuable on that debate.”</p>
<p>Pisces’ head jerked up. He stared at Ceria in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Ceria?”</p>
<p>She met his gaze levelly. The shock faded and Pisces’ expression returned to normal. Now it was a bitter scowl and a sardonic crook of the mouth that was supposed to be a smile. He turned away from her, brushing at his robes.</p>
<p>“Ah, you mean the debate? I wagered nothing of consequence, I assure you. I am…used to the bias of the masses even when presented with the most rational of arguments.”</p>
<p>“So I see. Why bother debating at all, then?”</p>
<p>He glanced back at her haughtily.</p>
<p>“I suppose it is to prove that I have a voice, and perhaps to sway opinions. They are bound under a truth spell to vote for whomever presents the best case, you know.”</p>
<p>“But they hate necromancy.”</p>
<p>“Not all! I have had a few vote in my favor—”</p>
<p>Pisces paused. He sniffed again, and frowned at Ceria.</p>
<p>“Not that it matters. Why, pray tell, have you sought me out?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t. I was just walking and saw a debate was going on.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>The two stared at each other. Ceria shifted from foot to foot as Pisces stared over her shoulder. It was…so hard to see him like this. At last, Ceria sighed.</p>
<p>“I talked to Mons a while ago. She says she studies with you.”</p>
<p>“Mons? Ah—she does. She hires me on occasion to provide her with instruction.”</p>
<p>“That’s good. For you, I mean.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it does…help.”</p>
<p>More silence. After a moment, Pisces cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“You know, I am studying combat magic in my spare time.”</p>
<p>“Really? I thought you gave up dueling.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, well, I cannot seem to find a match. I have no desire to duel practiced mages and I seem to be boycotted by all other students—but I am attempting to refine what spells I know. Mons claims to have benefitted greatly from practicing with me.”</p>
<p>Ceria tried to smile, but all she did was lift the corners of her mouth.</p>
<p>“That’s great, Pisces.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. You are—you would be welcome to join us if you had the time. I realize you may be somewhat preoccupied with your classes, but…”</p>
<p>Part of her wanted to say yes, but she couldn’t. Slowly, Ceria shook her head.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we’re friends anymore, Pisces.”</p>
<p>He looked her in the eyes then. She saw hurt and pain in his, but Pisces didn’t say what was clearly on the tip of his tongue. He was about to, but bit back the words. Then his eyes focused on Ceria’s again.</p>
<p>“In that case, are we enemies?”</p>
<p>He stared at her, searching for something, eyes gaunt and bloodshot, his robes dirty. Ceria felt a pang in her heart and glared at him.</p>
<p>“Don’t be stupid.”</p>
<p>She whirled and walked angrily away. But Ceria knew Pisces was smiling, just a tiny bit, behind her. She murmured under her breath.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t be enemies.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four days later, Ceria found herself sitting at a table with Illphres and four other mages. She was nervous, terrified out of her mind, and nearly knocked over her drink twice when she reached for it.</p>
<p>Illphres glared at her.</p>
<p>“Stop fidgeting.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see how she could, with you glaring at her so, Illphres.”</p>
<p>A tall Dullahan seated next to Ceria said that. His name was Jurix, and he was a powerful mage specializing in combat magic and physical reinforcement magic. Sitting across from Ceria, a Drake named Bastam winked at her reassuringly. Ophelia, the Stitch-woman smiled at Ceria, and the last mage, another Dullahan named Qum, nodded impassively at her.</p>
<p>That made Ceria feel a bit better, but she was still on pins and needles in the presence of so many important mages. She was sitting in the banquet hall, but at one of the tables usually claimed by older mages. It was made of some kind of expensive wood and the chairs were clearly expensive, if a bit worn, but Ceria would have preferred cushions.</p>
<p>And yet, it suited these mages well, because these five were all individuals who commanded quite a bit of influence and power of their own within Wistram. Each one was old; Ophelia, the youngest, was in her early thirties and Bastam, the oldest, was in his sixties, although he didn’t look it.</p>
<p>Any one of them—including Illphres—could cause an upset if they threw their influence into a political fight. Three of them were Isolationists—Bastam, Jurix, and Illphres, while Qum was undeclared and Ophelia was a Centrist. That was surprising in itself, given the Isolationist and the Centrist’s longstanding rivalry, but apparently they had an understanding.</p>
<p>This was Illphres’ group of allies, and Ceria felt out of place and very small sitting with them. But she was here for a reason.</p>
<p>“This is my new apprentice. Ceria. She’s annoying, but she’ll help get the equipment we need.”</p>
<p>That was Illphres’ way of introducing Ceria to the group. Jurix laughed as the others greeted Ceria. He put his head on the table to reach over and shake Ceria’s hand—she remembered to stare at his head while she shook, rather than at the empty space where his head should have been on a normal body.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen you about, and of course I saw you fighting those pirates a year ago, Ceria. If you managed to convince Illphres of all people to take you on as an apprentice, I have no doubt you’re a capable individual able to do pretty much anything.”</p>
<p>Ceria blushed bright red, but Ophelia looked at Illphres with concern.</p>
<p>“Just so long as you’re not planning on making her our sixth. That’s not your intention, surely?”</p>
<p>Illphres passed her hand over her mouth to smile wryly.</p>
<p>“Hardly. I didn’t want an apprentice and I still don’t. But she insisted.”</p>
<p>“Good. No offense Ceria, but I don’t want you getting killed for nothing.”</p>
<p>Ophelia nodded at Ceria and, confused, the half-Elf nodded back. She hesitated, but then cleared her throat.</p>
<p>“Um, what is this about? I know Illphres said she needed the rings enchanted against ice magic—I have them right here, they’re about Tier 4 enchantments which is the best I could get—but what is it for?”</p>
<p>The mages stared at the rings Ceria put on the table, courtesy of Calvaron and a very large amount of gold, and then at Illphres. After a moment Bastam burst out angrily.</p>
<p>“Ancestors, Illphres! You didn’t <em>tell</em> her what we’re going to do?”</p>
<p>Illphres shrugged, smiling wickedly. She seemed to enjoy the others’ consternation.</p>
<p>“Should I have? Teaching her is all I have to do. Why bother telling her something that she can’t change?”</p>
<p>The others groaned and covered their faces, but none of them looked surprised. They too were used to Illphres’ way of doing things. Ceria looked from face to face, wondering what was going on.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll tell her. Unless you object?”</p>
<p>The others shook their heads and Jurix turned to Ceria. She heard Ophelia casting a ward against eavesdropping as Jurix put his head on his shoulders and smiled at her. Then he turned and pointed. Ceria followed his finger and saw a Golem, one of the most primitive types, a crude man made of brown stone slowly wheeling out more food on a table.</p>
<p>He put each dish slowly and carefully on a table as students flowed past him, some taking food right off the plate as he paused so as not to bump any of them. He was just one of the many Golems in Wistram, practically the scenery that Ceria had gotten used to.</p>
<p>“See that Golem, Ceria? Well, he’s our enemy. Him and every Golem in Wistram. At the end of the year, Illphres, Bastam, Ophelia, Qum and I are going to challenge Cognita. We’re going to destroy her and open the doors to the rest of Wistram.”</p>
<p>He grinned at her. Ceria turned to Illphres and stared into her master’s eyes. The ice mage smiled deeply at Ceria. Ceria blinked, looked at the Golem serving food, and then flipped the table.</p>
<p>“<em>What!?</em>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Golems. They were a rarity in most parts of the world—unless you lived in a desert or if it snowed. Then they were more common, but you’d still only see the weakest, most primitive of Golems. Sand Golems, Snow Golems and so on were functions of nature, of excess mana and intention.</p>
<p>But Golems, the kind that were manufactured and sculpted or built and brought to life with magic, those were different. They were expensive, hideously so, to make, and only a powerful mage could create one.</p>
<p>Well, Ceria supposed even she could make a primitive, small one with work. But to create it would take months of study, and it would be hardly useful. She couldn’t imagine the effort needed to create a more advanced Golem.</p>
<p>The half-Elf walked through the halls of Wistram, distracted, hurrying past students without a word. Now that she looked, there were Golems all over Wistram. Okay, not many, not compared to the students, but too many.</p>
<p>A Golem passed her with a basket of laundry in his hands. He was a crude stone one, capable of following basic orders. She stared at him and shuddered as he passed. Okay, he was a simple one, but her idea of ‘simple’ had been skewed by living here.</p>
<p>A simple Golem? He was capable of obeying most instructions quite well! He could fetch and carry and fight or lift extremely heavy objects if need be. Forget simple, he was worth thousands of gold coins by himself, possibly ten thousand coins alone! An undying, tireless servant capable of killing lesser warriors with a body made of rock? He was powerful, not simple.</p>
<p>And he was the least of the Golems walking through Wistram. Ceria shuddered as she saw a suit of armor, gleaming and polished, meekly carrying a stack of books while he passed her by. He was a Golem built for war. His steel body was far more agile than the stone Golems and he had a sword and shield. If he used it—</p>
<p>But of course, he wouldn’t. Right? The Golems of Wistram had been made to protect and serve by Archmage Zelkyr. And enforce his will. But they were a valuable asset to the academy. They did chores, defended the isle against attack—</p>
<p>And kept the highest parts of the castle under lock and key. Ceria knew that—she’d known it since her first year. But she’d given little thought to it since then.</p>
<p>Wistram’s highest corridors and rooms were out of bounds. So what? There was plenty to do below it.</p>
<p>Only—there wasn’t. Wistram was only a quarter, or less of what it was. The true magics and real spells that would turn good mages into great ones were all above, locked behind a door guarded by Golems. That was what the five mages had told Ceria as she’d sat in the banquet hall in disbelief.</p>
<p>“You see, Ceria, there is a limit to the heights mages can reach here. Level 50, let alone Level 60 is the utmost limit we can strive towards. People like Archmage Feor or Amerys—they’re the top. And yet, it didn’t use to be this way. Once, we had real [Archmages].”</p>
<p>“Once we were true mages.”</p>
<p>Jurix and Illphres’ voice rang through Ceria’s ears. It wasn’t hard to understand what they were saying.</p>
<p>Cognita, the Golems of Wistram, they protected the academy. But they also held all mages within hostage. No one could reach beyond a certain level, not without more spells to study. Oh, a mage could study by themselves, but that meant their growth stagnated. In this place they had countless centuries—millennia of experience to draw upon, but it was all out of reach.</p>
<p>Guarded. By Cognita and four other Golems. Sentries, designed to be a test for mages to challenge. All those who had tried before had died, but once again mages had gathered. Five of the most powerful mages of Wistram had come together to challenge the Golem’s authority. And they would win or die.</p>
<p>It was too much for Ceria to take in. This was why Illphres needed the rings protecting against ice. She was going to fight alongside the others, and they needed protection from her deadly attacks.</p>
<p>Ceria had seen Illphres fight. She could freeze the air, raise huge structures of ice or hurl massive pillars of it at her enemies. She was going to use that magic to fight Cognita.</p>
<p>It was unthinkable to Ceria. She couldn’t believe—well, she <em>could</em> believe Illphres would keep it a secret. But the rest?</p>
<p>It was too much for her. That was how Ceria found herself at Pisces’ door, pounding on it and demanding to be let in. It took a while and she heard him bumping around inside, but eventually he opened it, glaring.</p>
<p>“Who in the name of—Ceria?”</p>
<p>He let her in, looking bewildered. Ceria stepped into Pisces’ room and found chaos. Dirt, mess, fragments of parchment and bits of food—that was the least of it. Ceria saw a pile of bones in the corner and nearly backed out of the room in horror.</p>
<p>“Is that—dead gods, Pisces!”</p>
<p>“It’s just mouse bones! Please, Ceria! I’ll—let me just clean this up!”</p>
<p>Pisces waved his hands at her, desperately shifting things about with gusts of wind and levitating them into corners or into his dresser. Ceria looked away from the pile of bones, shuddering, and didn’t ask where Pisces had put them when he told her she could come back in.</p>
<p>“I’m—sorry. I just—I need to practice, you understand, and I—”</p>
<p>“You’re not plundering the catacombs?”</p>
<p>Ceria eyed Pisces. She knew that quite a few mages were buried underneath the academy, even if she’d never dared go exploring for the crypts where their remains—if there were any—were interred. Pisces shook his head.</p>
<p>“I fear that would be…well, let’s just say I doubt others would take kindly to the knowledge that I were robbing graves.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, they wouldn’t. But <em>rat </em>bones?”</p>
<p>“Mice.”</p>
<p>“Is there a difference?”</p>
<p>Pisces shrugged. He fidgeted on his bed as he faced her—he seemed barely able to believe she was here, talking to him.</p>
<p>Ceria had no idea why she was talking to Pisces either. She was so shaken by what she’d just learned she had to speak to someone. And she had unconsciously come here. Now that she was actually facing Pisces, though, she didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>“Well. It’s been a while since I last came here.”</p>
<p>“Yes. It has.”</p>
<p>Pisces cleared his throat awkwardly.</p>
<p>“You look well.”</p>
<p>“You look—awful, frankly.”</p>
<p>He blinked, and then smiled at that. Ceria grinned shakily at him. Pisces looked around his dingy room.</p>
<p>“Yes, well, my circumstances have changed quite a lot since—before. My fortunes have fallen, so to speak.”</p>
<p>“Tell me about it.”</p>
<p>He sniffed.</p>
<p>“I hardly think <em>you</em> can make the same comparison, given—”</p>
<p>“No, I mean, tell me about it.”</p>
<p>He paused. Ceria looked at him.</p>
<p>“Tell me, Pisces. Tell me everything. And tell me why. And maybe—”</p>
<p>She didn’t say the rest. But slowly, Pisces relaxed his hunched posture. He straightened his back, and looked at Ceria like he used to.</p>
<p>“Well, if you insist…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Will you challenge them all at once?”</p>
<p>“We have to. The Golems fight together. Cognita will be there—and four others.”</p>
<p>Ceria stood with Illphres by the ocean, aiming at targets as the sun came up. Across the rocks, Bastam, Jurix, Ophelia and Qum were all doing the same.</p>
<p>She was a part of their group now. Not the same—she was the only apprentice and student among them—but they had no other confidants, no other apprentices to tell. Ceria knew, and this secret was one she’d never reveal.</p>
<p>“It might not matter if you do. But others would try and stop us or get in the way, or make it <em>political.</em> We’re doing this to end politics and factions once and for all.”</p>
<p>Illphres aimed at a target, an ice pillar three hundred meters away, the ice tinted red, and shattered it with a single spear of ice. Ceria nodded as she took aim at her own target.</p>
<p>“But I mean, why five of you? Is it because there will be five Golems, including Cognita? Is there a rule of some kind?”</p>
<p>“Rule? No.”</p>
<p>Illphres snorted as she raised more targets out of the sea.</p>
<p>“There’s no rule—other than that if you try, the test doesn’t end until you’re dead or the Golems are destroyed. We could attack them in the hallways if we weren’t afraid of all the Golems joining in. And every mage in Wistram could take on the challenge if they wanted to.”</p>
<p>“They why <em>don’t</em> they? Why only you five? If you got five more mages, surely—”</p>
<p>“They won’t try. They’re afraid of dying. Cowards.”</p>
<p>Illphres said it shortly. She shot a flurry of [Glacial Spears] out, shattering a dozen targets at once.</p>
<p>“They are afraid, and content to live like they have. Not us, though. All of us—the Isolationists who aren’t afraid to risk our lives and Ophelia and Qum—we see that mages cannot live like this. We want to grow, not die old at this level. We want to be true mages.”</p>
<p>“True mages.”</p>
<p>The word floated in the air between them. Ceria stared across the ocean and tried to imagine what lay beyond the door. But she couldn’t imagine the door itself.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen the Golems. You said there are four of them, not counting Cognita?”</p>
<p>Illphres turned.</p>
<p>“Would you like to see?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The door was stone. Not just any stone, but obsidian, shining and dark as night. Ceria could see it was warded as well. Across the room, it shone with a thousand sigils and runes, twining together to form the most powerful ward she could imagine.</p>
<p>She only dared look at the door from afar at the other end of the massive room, hundreds of feet wide and nearly forty feet high. That was because the guardians stood at the other end.</p>
<p>Three Golems. Ceria only saw three, but each one made her heart quake in her chest. Illphres stood next to her, which was the only reason Ceria didn’t run.</p>
<p>One was a Golem made of magma. It burned as the molten rock flowed around it, onto the floor, and back up, covering its body. It was fire incarnate, a core of something so bright it shone through the melting stone glowing at its heart.</p>
<p>The second was a creature of metal, something that looked like no species Ceria could ever dream of. Two thin, curved legs made it stand twenty feet tall. Each leg was incredibly thin and seemed to taper off into an edge like a blade. A narrow, metal body was its torso, roughly the same size as a normal Human’s, twenty feet up. It had two arms curved like the legs, half as long, and as sharp as scythes.</p>
<p>It had no face, and the way it stood so still made Ceria uneasy.</p>
<p>The third Golem was a simple one to understand, but no less frightening for it. It was a giant armored Golem, like one of the suits of armor but scaled up on a massive level. This Golem was a colossus, and it held a sword in one hand that was twice as tall as Ceria was and a shield of equal size and weight. It crouched, staring across the room at Ceria.</p>
<p>Only three Golems. Ceria didn’t see the fourth. <span style="color:#0c0e0e;">The Golem made of shadows stood next to her, noxious breath wafting over her as its jaws hovered close to her head.</span></p>
<p>The room stank, despite being clean. It smelled to Ceria of death, or perhaps it was her own fear she smelled. She saw Illphres was gazing at the Golems and shuddered.</p>
<p>When they left the room and the doors closed behind them, Ceria had to sit down in the empty corridor. Her legs had completely given out.</p>
<p>“Terrified?”</p>
<p>“Y—”</p>
<p>Ceria couldn’t even form the words to say ‘yes’. Illphres nodded.</p>
<p>“Each Golem in there is a masterpiece. A nightmare. Only a true mage could create one of them, let alone four.”</p>
<p>“Four? I saw—”</p>
<p>Ceria closed her mouth as she remembered. She hadn’t noticed it, not at all, but one of the Golems had been standing <em>right next to her</em>. A thing of shadows and flesh and—</p>
<p>She threw up. Illphres stood next to Ceria dispassionately, but she did magic away the vomit when Ceria was done.</p>
<p>“You noticed it? Good. It took Bastam three tries to figure it out. It <em>looks</em> like a Shadow Golem—I’m not even sure if you could make such a thing to begin with, but it’s really a Flesh Golem. It’s only enchanted to be covered in shadows and mess with the mind.”</p>
<p>“Dead gods. It was right next to me and I—I—”</p>
<p>“Remember them. They’re the enemy. But also remember, Cognita will be there as well. And of the five, she’s the most dangerous.”</p>
<p>“Cognita?”</p>
<p>Ceria couldn’t imagine Cognita stacking up to the Golems she’d seen in that room, for all she was terrifying in her own right. Illphres nodded.</p>
<p>“Don’t underestimate her. Truestone Constructs are the pinnacle of Golem creation for a reason. I have no idea what she can do, but I think she’ll be the most dangerous. But the others will be just as deadly. At least the armored knight Golem seems easy.”</p>
<p>“Easy? That thing was as big as a <em>house!</em>”</p>
<p>“It’s not one of the original guardian Golems. I know because records show the original one was destroyed. That’s a replacement, one of the Golems that normally defends Wistram. It may look dangerous, but it’s not nearly as bad as the others. I could take that one out by myself with no problem.”</p>
<p>Ceria stared at Illphres, but she knew the other woman was serious. That was the difference between her and her master.</p>
<p>“You’re really going to do this?”</p>
<p>“I’ve prepared for this day for over a decade. I gave my life to magic, and I will give my life to this battle if I must. But I believe we will win.”</p>
<p>Illphres smiled then. She looked at Ceria, and the mask of ice betrayed her true feelings. Her cold eyes burned with life.</p>
<p>“This is what we will challenge, Ceria. Don’t you see? This is what it means to be a true mage.”</p>
<p>Ceria saw, but she was still afraid. Illphres helped her up. The woman’s hand was surprisingly small on Ceria’s arm.</p>
<p>“I gave up everything for magic, Ceria. Everything. You saw my face. I’ve made mistakes, hurt myself, but always, always, I strived to reach higher. This is the ceiling I have come against. This is what I must overcome. And I will do it. And when I do, this academy will change. We will change it.”</p>
<p>The half-Elf looked up into the Human woman’s face. She knew, she remembered the fearsome enemies that stood in that room, waiting for their challengers. But she looked into Illphres’ eyes and believed.</p>
<p>“How can I help?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“<em>Cast the spell, Ceria!</em>”</p>
<p>Jurix screamed at Ceria as spells flashed around her in the largest of the practice rooms. She raised the wand he’d given her and gritted her teeth.</p>
<p>“[Fireball]!”</p>
<p>It was a spell she could only cast with a wand, not being wholly proficient at it. It streaked across the room at Illphres. The woman turned, raising her hands.</p>
<p>Ceria didn’t hear the word, but the fireball exploded, and when she could see, Ceria saw a huge wall of ice. Not just a wall—</p>
<p>A fortress. Illphres stood atop it, throwing magic down at the other mages around her as they besieged her. She raised walls of ice, froze the ground—</p>
<p>It was a battle between the best of mages. And it was only a practice session. Ceria watched as the other four mages slowly wore Illphres down, but it was hard, even for them. At the end she raised her hands in surrender and panting, they walked back towards Ceria to review.</p>
<p>“Those walls you make really are hard to crack, Illphres. I believe we might be able to lock down all the other Golems with it, save for the magma one.”</p>
<p>“And Cognita. She can shatter my ice.”</p>
<p>Illphres was sweating. She nodded at Ceria as the half-Elf passed her a flask of water. Ceria had food and drinks for the other mages, and they thanked her as they kept talking.</p>
<p>“You’re sure?”</p>
<p>“Ceria saw her smash through my barrier. It may be I can freeze her if I don’t give her room to move her arms—I can cast thicker ice walls than the one she broke—but I won’t bet on it.”</p>
<p>“Even so, if we can count on your abilities…”</p>
<p>Afterwards, Ceria talked with Illphres. The woman smiled as Ceria gushed over what she’d seen.</p>
<p>“It was incredible! You held them off, four other mages! Are you higher level? What was that spell?”</p>
<p>“[Fortress of the Ice Queen]. It has other names—it’s a famous spell. I’ll use it right off in our battle to shield the others.”</p>
<p>“Do you—do you think it’ll stop them?”</p>
<p>“Maybe. Maybe not. I’ll improvise. It doesn’t matter. We don’t stick to one plan. We’re all experienced mages and we’ll find a way to beat them one by one.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe how powerful you are. Why aren’t you an Archmage yourself?”</p>
<p>“Don’t want to be.”</p>
<p>Illphres shrugged as Ceria gaped.</p>
<p>“I might be able to, but that’s politics and I told you, I don’t care. Amerys—she’s famous for fighting on battlefields, but I think she’s only got eight levels or so on me. Maybe six.”</p>
<p>“<em>Six?</em>”</p>
<p>“Enough. If it came down to a duel between us she’d win.”</p>
<p>That wasn’t what Ceria wanted to hear. Illphres just smacked her on the back of the head.</p>
<p>“Don’t look like that. It’s about our combat styles.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? You two are friends, right? Why won’t she help you fight? I’m sure she’d love a chance to battle such powerful enemies.”</p>
<p>Illphres snorted and nearly laughed outright.</p>
<p>“Us? <em>Friends? </em>What gave you that idea? I can’t stand her.”</p>
<p>“But you train all the time! Every morning I see you two—”</p>
<p>“We’re competing. And yes, we sometimes train together. That’s because we’re a good match. She’s lightning and air and I’m ice and water. She prefers rapid all-out assaults and I use traps and fight drawn out battles. She doesn’t think and I plan every move.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>“And she won’t join us. I asked.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“She’s waiting for her King.”</p>
<p>That was all Illphres said. She and Ceria sat in silence, staring at the melting ice. After a moment, Illphres spoke again.</p>
<p>“If I had a minute to prepare, or if it was a double battle—”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I’d win. I’m one of the best mages at fighting defensively. You saw my barriers. That will be my role in the battle. So long as I live, I will protect my teammates.”</p>
<p><em>So long as I live.</em> Ceria shuddered at the words. They were a frank statement about what might happen. But she didn’t want to think of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To distract herself, Ceria went to Pisces more than once over the months that followed. Sometimes she came away happy, relieved that he hadn’t changed. Other times she stormed out of his room after a fight, or left wondering how the earnest young man she’d known had disappeared and been replaced by this thing. But it all came together a month before Illphres and the others planned to challenge the Golems, as Ceria let her anger explode at Pisces.</p>
<p>He was busy showing her the newest spells he’d learned. Ceria tried to focus; she knew Pisces had a terrible time obtaining new spellbooks or learning from anyone. But as her attention wavered from the brilliant [Flame Rapier] spell he had mastered, she stared at something covered with cloth in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>Pisces, engrossed in fencing with the flaming blade, whirled as he heard Ceria shout in surprise. She was backing away from the thing in the corner, the cloth in her hands.</p>
<p>“Ceria!”</p>
<p>She pointed, finger shaking.</p>
<p>“Is that—”</p>
<p>It was a deformed thing, barely recognizable. It was humanoid—barely. It had been made of wet clay that had dried and sculpted to look like a Human, but the sculptor, Pisces, was untrained and so the body was lumpy and the arms deformed. It had two stumps for legs.</p>
<p>“Ah, I see you’ve found my latest work. I was going to show you, but—”</p>
<p>“Pisces! <em>What is it?</em>”</p>
<p>He looked surprised at Ceria’s reaction.</p>
<p>“A Golem. One of my own creations. Don’t be alarmed; it’s barely functional. Worthless, really. Can’t you tell? I admit, the workmanship might be a tad shoddy, but—”</p>
<p>“<em>Get rid of it!</em>”</p>
<p>Ceria backed away from the clay thing. Pisces frowned at her.</p>
<p>“What? Don’t be alarmed, Ceria, it’s not animated!”</p>
<p>She rounded on him furiously.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, making a Golem? Aren’t there enough around here?”</p>
<p>He took a step back and stammered as Ceria shouted at him.</p>
<p>“Well, I was taught.”</p>
<p>“By <em>who?</em>”</p>
<p>“Cognita.”</p>
<p>The word doused the flames of Ceria’s anger in a second. She felt a chill in her stomach and stepped back from Pisces.</p>
<p>“Explain.”</p>
<p>“Well I—I’ve been talking with her, Ceria. You see, Cognita’s one of the only people—beings—in this academy who will give me the time of day. She’s quite brilliant, you know. She’s seen more magic than anyone in Wistram, and she taught me so many things about Golems and mage craft. She taught me how to make this Golem. Did you know that she thinks I have real aptitude? She even—”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk to her! Don’t go near her!”</p>
<p>“What? Why?”</p>
<p>“She’s the <em>enemy!</em>”</p>
<p>Ceria shouted at Pisces. He didn’t understand, and she couldn’t explain. She stomped over to his Golem and punched it. The brittle clay broke under her fist and Pisces shouted.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? Do you know how hard I worked to—”</p>
<p>“Why are you doing this?”</p>
<p>Ceria turned to Pisces. She thrust a finger in his chest, making him stumble back. His face was red with anger, but she was even more furious.</p>
<p>“First necromancy, now—<em>this?</em> Why can’t you practice normal magic? Why can’t you just be a normal mage? Everyone would accept you then! Why don’t you get a normal master and stop—”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think I’ve <em>tried?</em>”</p>
<p>Pisces shoved Ceria’s hand away. She blinked. His eyes were wide and bloodshot. Pisces nearly shouted, his voice cracking with passion.</p>
<p>“I’ve gone to every mage—every one I know or thought would consider having me as an apprentice. I’ve asked—none of them were willing to teach me even when I told them I’d swear off necromancy as long as I studied under them! No one will teach me, and I’m not going to afford the fees for next year! Don’t you understand!?”</p>
<p>After his outburst there was silence. Ceria stared at Pisces and slowly sank back into his chair. He couldn’t look at her.</p>
<p>“Necromancy? That’s just raising the dead. Some might object, but It’s no curse. But the fools who claim to be mages here treat it as such. Thus, I suppose the curse is indeed real—though by the prejudices and limited understanding of others.”</p>
<p>“You’re going to leave?”</p>
<p>He looked at her, on the brink of tears.</p>
<p>“I have to. I have no coin, no one to speak for me. The only hope I have is a master, but who would take me as their apprentice?”</p>
<p>Ceria’s mind raced. The words came out before she could think about it.</p>
<p>“Illphres. My master. She might.”</p>
<p>Pisces stared at her, but then shook his head, closing his eyes.</p>
<p>“She will say no. I know Illphres—she would never agree.”</p>
<p>“I could ask—”</p>
<p>“She’ll say no.”</p>
<p>Pisces turned away. He walked back over to the broken Golem and stared at it.</p>
<p>“Leave me, Springwalker. I am—busy. I have work to do, especially if this year is to be my last.”</p>
<p>She stared at him, and then slowly walked out of the room. Only after she felt a bit of liquid dripping from her hand did she realize the clay Golem’s shards had cut her skin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Take Pisces on as an apprentice? No. Don’t be stupid.”</p>
<p>Illphres looked at Ceria as though she were mad when Ceria brought it up to her the next day. The two were sitting on the edge of the walkway above the ocean.</p>
<p>Just sitting. Ceria had gotten over her fear of heights, mainly because Illphres had made her come up here to practice. A mage could have no weaknesses, after all. She stared down at the sea below, fighting her belly.</p>
<p>“Why not? He’s smart, gifted—he needs a master or he won’t be able to stay!”</p>
<p>“Too bad, I guess. But I’m not teaching him.”</p>
<p>“<em>Why?</em>”</p>
<p>Illphres took her time in replying. She’d grown—not warmer, but maybe a bit softer towards Ceria over the year. In the last month, she was downright friendly at times. Both could feel it. The time of the challenge was approaching fast.</p>
<p>“He’s not my type.”</p>
<p>Ceria nearly tumbled off the bridge in shock. Illphres clarified after giving Ceria a smack on the arm.</p>
<p>“I mean that he will never be an ice mage. You might, or at least, you’ll learn Skills and change your class from what I’ve taught you. But that boy is a [Necromancer] through and through. I don’t feel like teaching someone who won’t follow in my footsteps.”</p>
<p>“But if you’d speak for him—”</p>
<p>“I don’t need to. And none of the others will take him on as an apprentice either, Ceria.”</p>
<p>“<em>Why?</em> Pisces is—”</p>
<p>“Don’t you understand? After the end of this month, none of it will matter.”</p>
<p>Ceria’s eyes widened. Illphres nodded.</p>
<p>“That’s right. After the challenge, i—<em>when</em> we win, all of the bickering , the factions and the politics…”</p>
<p>She paused.</p>
<p>“Well, it’ll probably go on as normal. But we’ll be on top.”</p>
<p>“How? If you defeat the Golems—”</p>
<p>“We’ll prove that our way works. Mages will rally to us, and those that don’t will have to fight to venture higher. But we’ll be guarding the entrance. It might be a war, or it might be quiet, but the Council won’t sit and pass decisions any longer. It will be every mage for themselves, as it used to be. As it should be.”</p>
<p>Ceria tried to imagine it. She thought of Calvaron and Beatrice fighting for more power and shook her head.</p>
<p>“I think things might still be the same.”</p>
<p>“Really? You might be right. We’ll see. But one thing I can promise you: when we open the higher levels of Wistram up, I’ll use my influence. You, Pisces, and all the other mages who have a spine and a brain will stay.”</p>
<p>“As the Isolationists?”</p>
<p>“As mages. True mages.”</p>
<p>That was all Illphres said. Ceria stared at her, and realized that Illphres was the first Human she’d ever known that she truly looked up to. She’d admired Pisces for his brilliance, but Illphres was different. She was actually a bit younger than Ceria, but she felt so much older. She shone, and she stood higher than the half-Elf, reaching for the stars.</p>
<p>Ceria couldn’t say any of this out loud, of course. If she did Illphres would probably toss her into the ocean. Instead, she just turned and stared at the dark night sky.</p>
<p>“When the day comes, I’ll be waiting for you outside the doors. So make sure you finish the battle quickly, okay? I don’t feel like waiting long.”</p>
<p>“Insolent girl.”</p>
<p>Illphres’ voice was amused. Ceria didn’t look at her, but she knew the woman was smiling.</p>
<p>“I’ll take as long as I please. And when it’s over I’ll make you practice twice as hard learning all the spells you need to be halfway competent.”</p>
<p>“Promise?”</p>
<p>The woman was silent for a long time. After a while, she sighed.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>They stared out across the ocean. Ceria felt a humming in her bones, a tightness in her chest that didn’t go away when she slept. She felt as though she could run a thousand miles from sheer nervous energy, and that she didn’t want to move a muscle at the same time.</p>
<p>There was one month left. One month.</p>
<p>Until it would all be over.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Her name was Cognita. That was what she told the people she met.</p>
<p>Her name was Cognita. She had once been shaped and given life by Archmage Zelkyr, the greatest expert in Golem creation of his era. Perhaps ever. Because Cognita was a Truestone Golem.</p>
<p>The word itself was a symbol of her authority. Truestone Golems or Truestone Constructs as they were once known were thought to be the pinnacle of artificial creation. For if Cognita was not the strongest Golem that could be made, she alone had what other Golems lacked. Personality. Thought. Feeling.</p>
<p>Perhaps even a soul.</p>
<p>But who could tell? Few people found Golems reassuring, despite their usefulness. And Cognita was feared for reasons beyond just her nature.</p>
<p>She killed mages. She had killed hundreds, perhaps thousands. And yet she was subservient, helpful, polite. So those who met her were both terrified and confused by her, because a monster should <em>look</em> and <em>act</em> like a monster.</p>
<p>But what Cognita actually thought was a mystery. At all times her carved eyes judged and saw, but never gave away anything. She had seen countless mages, seen their triumph and their end. She looked at two more now.</p>
<p>One was a half-Elf, the other a Human. Both were young by the standards of their species. Once, they had been friends. The Golem saw traces of it still, even as they argued.</p>
<p>“They won’t ever let you stay. Not after what you said.”</p>
<p>“They haven’t accepted me thus far, Springwalker. Why should those fools change their minds now?”</p>
<p>“Don’t call me Springwalker! And you know damn well there’s a difference between keeping your head down and poking the beehive!”</p>
<p>Pisces and Ceria were shouting in front of Cognita, a rarity in itself. Few people raised their voices anywhere around the Golem, but Pisces knew Cognita. He alone had sought her out, asked her questions, befriended her.</p>
<p>Ceria just didn’t care. She was close to kicking the mage—again. He hopped away from her, glaring.</p>
<p>“Those philistines that make up the so-called Council—they are blind to what I proposed, but you at least should be able to consider the implications of what I’ve said!”</p>
<p>“Implications? You want to create an undead that can <em>level, </em>Pisces! You’re an idiot! If you succeeded you’d destroy the world, but that won’t happen because it’s impossible!”</p>
<p>He raised a shaking finger. He was angry. He was always angry, and hurt, of late. So was the half-Elf. Together, Cognita saw fury and fear on both sides clashing together.</p>
<p>“It is possible. In theory! Didn’t you listen to my proposal? If I were to create an undead by weaving the spells into it on a much more in-depth level than normal—something closer to how a Golem is created than a body is animated—it might work!”</p>
<p>“It’s <em>stupid.</em>”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with that idea? I have all the pieces of the puzzle in my possession—almost. Cognita taught me the formula used for embodying Golems with sentience, don’t you see? That alone—”</p>
<p>“Only you would be stupid enough to ask! Cognita is—”</p>
<p>Pause. The half-Elf’s face shifted towards Cognita and the Golem saw her red cheeks pale slightly. She looked away rather than meet the Golem’s gaze.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Cognita. But Pisces—you’re a fool. It would never work. Why hasn’t a [Necromancer] done it before? Two reasons. One—it’s stupid and the second is that if the undead could level, they’d destroy entire nations!”</p>
<p>“I would only make one. And it <em>is</em> possible, but only with the correct base materials.”</p>
<p>Pisces’ voice was calm. He stared at his former friend, speaking with the conviction that was halfway into insanity. He glanced at Cognita too, but his gaze was burning. He looked at the Golem not as a threat or something to be feared, but as a challenge. A vision of what could be done.</p>
<p>“Golems require high-grade materials to be built. Mana stones, rock without impurity—Cognita, if I may refer to your construction, you are a product of both spellcraft and the superior base products from which you were given life. So why not apply that theory in the case of the undead? Most bodies are just that, bodies. But if there were a way to obtain superior parts—”</p>
<p>“Parts?”</p>
<p>Cognita turned back to look at the half-Elf. She was furious. And the Golem knew the conversation was over. Ceria pointed a shaking finger at Pisces.</p>
<p>“You’re—disgusting. And insane. And I don’t have time to argue with you. If you want to go spouting off crazy theories, go ahead. I’m going to practice real magic.”</p>
<p>She stormed off. Pisces called to her once as she left, but Ceria did not turn her head. He turned back to Cognita in frustration.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry you had to witness that, Cognita. Please, accept my apologies. I thought I could convince Ceria with your help, but she is unwilling to listen to reason.”</p>
<p>Cognita made no immediate reply. She could have told Pisces a thousand things, spoken from decades of observation. Some would help, others might shatter the young man. After a moment, Cognita made a decision and spoke while looking Pisces in the eye.</p>
<p>“She cannot accept what you do. And you cannot accept that she does not consider you a friend. Perhaps the question is then whether you value friendship or magic more.”</p>
<p>He was speechless. He opened his mouth to respond, but Cognita strode down the hallway after Ceria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ceria Springwalker.”</p>
<p>If it had been Pisces or anyone else, Ceria would have ignored them or shoved them aside. But Cognita’s deep, inflectionless voice made her tense in sudden fear. She turned, trying to conceal the fear in her heart.</p>
<p>“Yes, Cognita?”</p>
<p>“I believe Pisces would like me to express his apologies in his stead. However, I will not do so. I would merely like to speak with you for a few more moments if you have time.”</p>
<p>Ceria paused. She was still furious at Pisces, livid. His presentation to the Council had set Wistram in an uproar, and he was now more of a pariah than he had been before.</p>
<p>That wasn’t the only reason she was so angry, though. The day Illphres would challenge Archmage Zelkyr’s Golems was only two weeks away. And so Ceria was angry, frightened, and nervous. But she tried to hide all that from Cognita.</p>
<p>The Golem was the enemy.</p>
<p>“Talk to me? I—sure, Cognita. Why do you want to talk?”</p>
<p>“Hearing your reactions and thoughts intrigues me. I was created to think and learn, and this topic—and your discussion—is interesting to me in a way few things are.”</p>
<p>That was extraordinary. And unhelpful. Ceria stared at Cognita as if searching for a weak point. But the stone woman was flawless.</p>
<p>“I guess I can talk.”</p>
<p>“Very well. Thank you.”</p>
<p>The Golem fell silent. After a few seconds of awkwardness, Ceria realized Cognita was waiting for her to speak. Ceria didn’t know what to say. She’d said what she thought. Pisces was insane. His idea was insane. But Cognita—</p>
<p>She glanced up at the Golem. Cognita’s face seldom changed, but Ceria could remember her smiling just once.</p>
<p>“Cognita? Did you really teach Pisces one of Archmage Zelkyr’s spells?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>The Truestone Construct—the thing that had a name and a mind—paused.</p>
<p>“He asked. And it was an incomplete spell. I believe Pisces has a chance of completing it. In his own way.”</p>
<p>Another revelation. This one hurt Ceria’s heart. It was one thing to know Pisces was smart, acknowledge that he could do things Ceria could not. He was a genius, but this? Pisces had a chance to do what Archmage Zelkyr could not. Cognita had said so. It made Ceria doubt the angry words she had spoken to him.</p>
<p>“Do you support him doing necromancy? Do you even care?”</p>
<p>“I see in his magic something akin to what mages do when they shape Golems, but different. I care not if they are dead bodies or clay and stone that is shaped. I believe his ideas are intriguing. I wonder if he will be able to do as he claims. Even for Zelkyr, the only creation he was able to imbue with true intelligence was a Truestone Golem, my kind. What base material would be equivalent among the dead?”</p>
<p>Ceria had no idea. But she shivered again to think of a walking thing, some shambling zombie with rotting flesh that could grow stronger. What if it could talk? What if it could think, like Cognita? A talking, leveling undead was too close to an actual person, yet indescribably far away from life at the same time.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if Pisces can do it. But I feel like it’s wrong. That’s all I can say. I’m sorry. I have to go.”</p>
<p>She didn’t want to look at Cognita anymore. The Golem nodded.</p>
<p>“I will leave you to your business after mentioning one last issue. The day when your master and four other mages plan to challenge me is fifteen days away. I trust they are all prepared and aware of the consequences of failure?”</p>
<p>The breath caught in Ceria’s chest. She stared back at Cognita, eyes wide. How did the Golem <em>know?</em></p>
<p>“That—that’s right. They know. My master knows.”</p>
<p>Cognita nodded once again.</p>
<p>“Please inform her that if she or any of the other mages desire to wait or change the appointed time, I would be happy to do so. Good night, Ceria Springwalker.”</p>
<p>She turned and began to walk away. Ceria took one look at Cognita’s back and fled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You <em>told </em>Cognita when you’d be challenging her?”</p>
<p>Illphres looked up with a frown as Ceria slammed the door behind her and stormed into the room.</p>
<p>“Told who?”</p>
<p>“<em>Cognita!</em>”</p>
<p>Ceria clutched at her hair. She’d run all the way to Illphres’ room. The mage shrugged.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes. We told her.”</p>
<p>“<em>Why?</em>”</p>
<p>“It’s convenient. It means she knows and won’t be busy, and it means we can’t back out.”</p>
<p>“But if she knows, she could set traps. Prepare—”</p>
<p>“She won’t. She never has and never will. But this way we won’t alert the entire academy when Cognita goes striding up to the top floor.”</p>
<p>Illphres was too calm. She was always calm. She held a book with a light blue bound cover in her hands, glancing at the page and at Ceria as she spoke. It was her personal spellbook.</p>
<p>“Calm down. Stop pacing. It’s annoying.”</p>
<p>Ceria stopped. She whirled and looked at her master.</p>
<p>“Tell me you can do it.”</p>
<p>Illphres sighed and closed the book. She stared at the ceiling, and then looked at Ceria.</p>
<p>“We have a chance.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
<p>“Because it was nearly done once.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Ceria’s ears perked up. Illphres nodded.</p>
<p>“A group of mages nearly succeeded. So we can too.”</p>
<p>“But how do you know? Is there a history or—”</p>
<p>“A few records of challenges, but no. We can tell just from the Golems in the room. Sit. Think about how we can tell.”</p>
<p>Ceria sat unwillingly. She fidgeted, and then came up with the only explanation she could think of.</p>
<p>“The missing Golem. The one replaced by the armored knight one.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. That’s proof.”</p>
<p>“But that’s only one of the five Golems—”</p>
<p>“No, it’s a sign. Think.”</p>
<p>Illphres sighed as her tone grew waspish. She hated explaining things when she thought Ceria should understand.</p>
<p>“Any idiot could figure it out. Archmage Zelkyr made this challenge for any mages trying to reach the higher floors, didn’t he? He designed it to be challenged over and over again, which meant that he would expect his four guardian Golems—plus Cognita—to never be destroyed. They would fight in tandem and overwhelm their opponents without sustaining enough damage to be destroyed.”</p>
<p>“So the missing Golem—”</p>
<p>“It’s a sign that someone broke their formation. And nearly won, too. Because if they could isolate one of the Golems long enough to destroy it, it meant they could hold off the rest. None of those Golems would be easy to disassemble with any one spell.”</p>
<p>“And that means you can all do the same. Easier, especially if one of the Golems is weaker…”</p>
<p>Ceria sat up, eyes shining. Illphres nodded calmly.</p>
<p>“We can do it. There is a possibility.”</p>
<p>“That makes me feel better. I was talking with Cognita—”</p>
<p>Slowly, Ceria explained her argument to Illphres. The mage rolled her eyes when Ceria was done.</p>
<p>“I heard about that. Levelling undead? I don’t see why everyone’s so upset. ”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>“It’s no different from anyone else leveling up. A half-Elf can live for centuries if they want, how’s that different from an undead? It sounds like it would be hard to make more than one or two. If they get out of hand you can destroy them. The real reason you’re upset is because you hate necromancy.”</p>
<p>Ceria bit her lip and made no reply. Illphres sighed.</p>
<p>“Necromancy is magic. I don’t fear your friend. He reanimates the dead. I freeze people. And I hardly look better than the undead. You have seen beneath my mask. You know that.”</p>
<p>“It’s not the same.”</p>
<p>“No?”</p>
<p>Illphres raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Magic is magic, and that boy Pisces was your friend, once. Does knowing he practices necromancy change all that?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“I suppose you weren’t good friends, then. Enough.”</p>
<p>Illphres waved away Ceria’s objections and levitated the book in her hands over to the half-Elf.</p>
<p>“Study the [Glacial Spear] spell. I want you to make at least <em>some</em> progress before the challenge day.”</p>
<p>“I’d learn more if you let me keep the book! Or made me a copy!”</p>
<p>Ceria complained as she bent over the pages of tightly-written text. Illphres laughed sardonically.</p>
<p>“Copy the book? I don’t know how to write magical spells down. That’s a specialist class, [Magical Scribe] or some such. And it would take a Level 40 one to write that spell down.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Ceria looked up with a frown. Illphres nodded. She began lecturing as Ceria listened with one ear and read with both her eyes.</p>
<p>“Spellbooks are rare because they can’t be copied without extensive study by a powerful mage, or a class with similar Skills. And scribing a spell is only possible for someone of an equal or higher level than the spell itself. So a Tier 4 spells might be rare but findable in a given collection of spellbooks, but Tier 6 would be extremely difficult to locate. And Tier 8—”</p>
<p>“How would anyone learn the spells, then?”</p>
<p>“By piecing together clues left by other mages, following instructions in languages other than magic to come up with it. Or by leveling and obtaining it or coming up with such a spell themselves.”</p>
<p>“So this spellbook—”</p>
<p>“Is mine.”</p>
<p>“Can you let me borrow—”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two weeks was too long and too short for Ceria. She went through each day emotionally and mentally exhausted, and tossed and turned each night with nervous, physical energy.</p>
<p>That also led to her actively avoiding her friends, and them avoiding her. Ceria was waspish, irritable, and prone to snap at anything and everything. She confined herself to her room when she wasn’t with Illphres or the other mages.</p>
<p>Three days before the challenge, Ceria was in her room, almost out of her mind with the agony of waiting. She heard a knock at the door and snapped.</p>
<p>“Come in already!”</p>
<p>Pisces entered. Ceria snapped again.</p>
<p>“Get out!”</p>
<p>“Please, just listen!”</p>
<p>His eyes were sparkling and Pisces was rubbing his hands together. He looked like he had in the past, full of life and enthusiasm. Ceria couldn’t bear to see it, not now, not when she was so anxious.</p>
<p>“Pisces, I’m not in the mood—”</p>
<p>“Hear me out, hear me out I implore you! I was just talking with Cognita—”</p>
<p>It was the last name Ceria wanted to hear right now, but Pisces couldn’t know that. She tried to stare a hole in his face as he talked excitedly onwards.</p>
<p>“She and I were discussing intelligence, cognizance and how only she among all the Golems has it. I opined that it was a mystery why Zelkyr would have failed with other Golems when she revealed this to me! Archmage Zelkyr only imbued Cognita with the capacity for thought. But over the years the other Golems have achieved a low level of intelligence, at least communally.”</p>
<p>Ceria just stared at Pisces, arms crossed, trying to decode his words. He stared at her, practically shining with energy.</p>
<p>“Don’t you see what this means? The Golems in Wistram <em>can</em> think! They can learn to think, that is! And if there’s a possibility of them learning, why not in a creation designed for that capacity? Why, we know that feral Ghouls can think in a primitive hunter-predator sense, and other undead like Crypt Lords, Liches, and Revenants can all—”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to hear it.”</p>
<p>Ceria cut Pisces off flatly. He looked astonished. She stared at him.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to hear it. I don’t want to hear about Cognita—I want you to get out!”</p>
<p>Pisces stopped. He stepped back, looking hurt and offended. He half-turned towards her open door as if he was going to storm out, and changed his mind. Instead, he turned towards her, and spoke pleadingly. She didn’t want to hear, but his words washed over her.</p>
<p>“Ceria, I don’t understand why you’re not giving me a chance to speak. I’m trying to prove a point. I know you have objections to my—to what I do, but please, listen! My goal isn’t to destroy the world or create armies like Az’kerash. When I practice necromancy, the reason I started was—”</p>
<p>It was too much. Ceria interrupted Pisces with the only thing she could use. The truth.</p>
<p>“They’re going to challenge her.”</p>
<p>He stopped, frowning.</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>Ceria knew she shouldn’t tell him. But now the dam had burst and she let it out. It was a relief and terrifying to say it out loud.</p>
<p>“Illphres. Jurix. Bastam. Ophelia. Qum. They’re all part of a group—they’ve been training all year and they’re going to challenge Zelkyr’s Golems to go to the higher levels.”</p>
<p>The half-Elf stared down at her hands, at her bitten fingernails. She saw Pisces sit down hard on the side of her bed out of the corner of her eyes.</p>
<p>“When?”</p>
<p>“It’s going to be three days from now. Right before lunch.”</p>
<p>Her breath caught in her chest at the words. It was out. The secret was spoken, and now Ceria felt it pressing down on her harder than before. Pisces spoke quietly.</p>
<p>“Illphres and four others? They’re serious?”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded. Pisces went still. She could feel him close to her. A familiar presence. Comforting.</p>
<p>“I would advise you to stop them. If I thought they would listen. Cognita is—an unknown quantity. I believe she is more than a match for any of the Archmages of today by herself.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. She probably is.”</p>
<p>Ceria hugged her knees to her chest and rocked back and forth a bit. She nodded and then shook her head.</p>
<p>“But they’re going to do it. Illphres is going to fight. I can’t stop her. I wouldn’t dare try. She has to do this, don’t you see, Pisces? If we can’t go above, we can’t be true mages. Wistram is stagnant. We don’t have real Archmages, just fakes! Don’t you see—”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>Pisces cut her off shortly. Ceria looked and saw he was staring at his feet as he sat on her bed.</p>
<p>“I know. Wistram is decaying. Magic is not as powerful as it was before Zelkyr. Powerful, yes, and one could argue there are more mages being produced by the academy as a result of the Golem’s presence, but—I know. And I believe Cognita knows this too.”</p>
<p>“She does?”</p>
<p>“We have spoken about it. On occasion.”</p>
<p>Ceria grabbed for Pisces. He jerked, but she yanked at his dirty robes. Part of his shoulder and chest became exposed as he fought to loosen her deathgrip.</p>
<p>“Ceria—”</p>
<p>“Don’t warn her. I mean, she knows, but don’t tell her anything. She’s—”</p>
<p>“I won’t. It wouldn’t matter if I did. Cognita wouldn’t cheat. She’s waiting for a mage to—Ceria, please. I won’t tell anyone.”</p>
<p>Slowly, Ceria let go. Pisces adjusted his robes and the two fell into silence. After a few minutes, Pisces spoke again.</p>
<p>“Thank you for telling me. I won’t reveal a thing. I promise.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“And I hope—I most sincerely hope Illphres and the others defeat Cognita. I would like you to know that, Ceria.”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>They stared at each other. It had been a long time since Ceria really met Pisces’ eyes. He looked older, she realized. In a few short years he’d grown older, from a late teenager into a young man. Older, more tired, more bitter.</p>
<p>But still him.</p>
<p>Pisces looked away first. He stood up, brushing himself off and then realizing he was in Ceria’s room and stopping.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to go. I’ll leave you to—we can talk later, Ceria.”</p>
<p>He began to leave but stopped. Ceria was holding on to the back of his robe.</p>
<p>“Don’t go.”</p>
<p>He looked back at her, eyes wide. Ceria stared at him. Slowly, Pisces sat back down.</p>
<p>“The door’s open.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Ceria said it without really caring. She and Pisces sat together with the open doorway leading out into the corridor. Part of her told her she was an idiot for blurting out all those secrets, but Ceria knew few people ventured down this hallway, especially at night.</p>
<p>She didn’t stand up to close the door. And neither did Pisces. Eventually, the door did get closed, by magic. But no one left the room until the next morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The day of the challenge Ceria couldn’t eat. Everything leading up to this day seemed like a brief dream, something someone else had experienced. But what was worse was the day itself.</p>
<p>It was too normal. It was too quiet. It was too—</p>
<p>Peaceful.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a holiday. Classes went on like normal, and mages gathered in the corridors, gossiping. They ate in the banquet halls, and walked about as if they had not a care in the world.</p>
<p>Ceria skipped all her classes. She’d skipped the last eight days in truth, spending all her time with Illphres and the other mages. Now she ate breakfast with them, or rather, watched them eat with her stomach trying to shove itself back out her mouth.</p>
<p>“Eat something, Ceria. We can’t have you fainting when we walk out of there.”</p>
<p>Jurix pressed an apple into Ceria’s hand. She looked at it and turned green. He snatched it away.</p>
<p>“Okay, don’t eat. I’ll do it for you.”</p>
<p>“Watch it, Jurix. Don’t eat too much. We’ll probably be moving around a lot.”</p>
<p>Bastam warned the Dullahan as he ate sparingly from a bowl filled with oats and honey. His tail was wagging back and forth faster than normal, but he appeared calm. So did the others. They were far too calm compared to Ceria, who looked as pale as a Selphid by now.</p>
<p>“I think I’ll pull out my stomach before we go in. I’ll be lighter that way.”</p>
<p>Ophelia murmured as she spooned some gravy sparingly over her breakfast of eggs and bacon. Did her hands shake a bit? She smiled at Ceria and the butterflies danced in the girl’s stomach.</p>
<p>“Bah. You lot don’t know anything. Dullahans know to eat a big meal the day of a battle and a small one later. Isn’t that right, Qum?”</p>
<p>Jurix stared across the table at the other Dullahan. He preferred to eat with his head on his shoulders, an oddity for a Dullahan. Qum nodded and spoke softly.</p>
<p>“Proper intake is key.”</p>
<p>Illphres glared at the two. She was eating sparingly as well.</p>
<p>“Just so long as you pass it before noon. If you think I’m fighting a battle alongside two constipated Dullahans—”</p>
<p>Everyone laughed. It was a rare joke—actually, not a joke since Illphres said it. But it was what they needed. Ceria tried to smile and failed. She fidgeted in her chair, and checked the position of the sun through a window. When it was right overhead, the challenge would begin. But it felt like it was frozen in the air! She looked back at Jurix as the Dullahan made a joke.</p>
<p>And then—it seemed to Ceria as if she remembered walking around with the others in a blur, listening to them talk. But suddenly, disconcertingly, she was standing in front of the two doors that led into the challenge room, as if the day had gone in an instant.</p>
<p>It was time.</p>
<p>The hallway was simple. Long and straight, it let people come up either stairway at both ends of the corridor. In the middle of the hallway, two double doors sat in the stone wall, the only entrance to the upper floors.</p>
<p>The five mages and Ceria gathered there, but not in silence. Each one was nervous now, and Ceria could sense it. But none of them gave voice to that worry. They joked instead, or stood calmly, or shook hands or claws. They formed up in front of the door, but not before stopping to speak to Ceria of all people.</p>
<p>She was their lone witness. The mages had told no one else that today was the day, and none of them had apprentices. Ophelia was the first to hold Ceria’s hand, smiling warmly. The stitches around her mouth pulled as she kissed Ceria on the cheek, to the half-Elf’s shock.</p>
<p>“Once this is over I might have to teach you a bit as well. It’ll all be different, Ceria. I promise. Mages will change. This place will change.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be waiting for you to shake my hand. So don’t go anywhere—this won’t take long.”</p>
<p>Jurix grasped Ceria’s hand tightly as he looked her in the eye. She nodded, throat too constricted to speak.</p>
<p>Bastam was next.</p>
<p>“You know, I saw your exam. I thought that you had courage then, courage and daring. I thought to myself, that’s what we’ve forgotten, all the older mages. I’ll show you we have it today.”</p>
<p>He passed her by and Qum was there. The Dullahan bowed his torso to Ceria and then held up his head. He regarded her solemnly.</p>
<p>“Luck to us all.’”</p>
<p>Illphres was last. She and Ceria stood apart from the others as the mages began casting spells. Ward spells, spells to increase their physical condition or protect against attacks. Illphres cast no spells. Hers was already active.</p>
<p>The walls of the corridor were already frosting over with ice. Ceria began to shiver and shake uncontrollably as the temperature around Illphres lowered and lowered again. The other mages weren’t affected—they all had artifacts to protect them against her cold, but Ceria didn’t have any.</p>
<p>Illphres looked at Ceria without an expression on her face, but then she let the ice reshape her lips into a smile.</p>
<p>“Seems like I need to increase your training if you’re cold from only this much. Remind me once I’m out.”</p>
<p>Ceria tried to smile, but her lips couldn’t move. Illphres stared at the double doors, and Ceria felt the chill around her grow deeper. It was so cold. But the mage’s voice was light when she spoke next.</p>
<p>“If I was an adventurer, if I had gone out into the world and fought monsters and gone into dungeons for a few years, maybe I wouldn’t be so scared now.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The woman turned back to Ceria, smiling.</p>
<p>“I grew up in Wistram. I spent my life here. But perhaps if I’d gone out into the world and gained more experience—well, I’d probably be scared all the same. There are wonders and horrors in this world, Ceria, remnants from the ages when gods still lived, memories of empires long gone. This is one of them. And today we will challenge the power of one of the true [Archmages] of Wistram.”</p>
<p>“I know you’ll succeed. I know it.”</p>
<p>Illphres just smiled. She put a hand on Ceria’s shoulder and the half-Elf shivered. Illphres looked deep into Ceria’s eyes as she whispered to the young half-Elf.</p>
<p>“Remember this, Ceria. For good or bad it matters not. In tragedy or triumph it is the same. Today you will stare into the heart of it.”</p>
<p>She smiled at Ceria. Her hand was cool on the half-Elf’s shoulder. Cold to the touch, but not freezing. The ice thickened on the walls around Illphres. She looked into the half-Elf’s eyes.</p>
<p>“This is <em>magic.</em>”</p>
<p>Then she turned away. Jurix stepped up to the doors and glanced to his left and right. Illphres stood next to him on his left with Qum further down, Bastam and Ophelia on the right.</p>
<p>“Ready?”</p>
<p>They nodded. Jurix took a breath, and then put his hands on the double doors. He pushed, and they flew open.</p>
<p>As one, the five mages stepped into the room that lay beyond. Ceria took a step towards their backs, but dared go no further.</p>
<p>The Golems of Zelkyr waited in the room beyond. She caught a glimpse of five figures, standing on the other edge of the room. A golem made of burning rock. A metal reaper standing tall and silent. A behemoth knight made of metal. <span style="color:#0c0e0e;">A dark thing already bounding across the room, quiet, panting.</span></p>
<p>And Cognita, standing tall and proud against the obsidian doors, arms outstretched.</p>
<p>Welcoming the challengers.</p>
<p>Then the doors slammed shut and Ceria saw nothing else. Heard nothing else.</p>
<p>The challenge had begun and she could only wait. If there were any gods, Ceria would have prayed. But she could only hope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It felt like time stopped after the doors closed. Ceria stared at them, and then wondered what she should do. Sit down? No—she wanted to be standing when everyone came out.</p>
<p>But how long would it take? Suddenly, Ceria was consumed by that question. She shivered in the freezing air as she stared at the double doors. Not a sound passed from the room beyond. She couldn’t tell what was happening. She could only imagine.</p>
<p>What would happen first? Would Cognita speak before the battle began, give the mages one last chance to turn back? Would Illphres or the others speak? She wasn’t one for speeches, but Jurix might say something, or Bastam.</p>
<p>How long would that take if they did that? Or—what if the fight began the instant the mages stepped into the room? Would it be over in seconds?</p>
<p>Surely not. Either way—Illphres would slow them down with ice. She’d create barriers. It would be impossible to kill her and the others in an instant. They were already warded and prepared for battle.</p>
<p>So how long would it take to destroy the Golems? Ceria guessed as she shivered in front of the door. The ice generated by Illphres’ field of cold was still coating the walls, overwhelming Ceria’s own ability to nullify the chill.</p>
<p>When would it be over? No—when would the mages come out? Because, surely, they might rest after the battle. Ceria tried to calculate the time it would take.</p>
<p>Magical battles were rarely long, but this one was different. So…five minutes? That was far too short. Ten? Twenty?</p>
<p>Ceria waited. She knew the minutes were passing as she tried to put a number to her fear. After five minutes she felt relieved. Or told herself she was relieved.</p>
<p>Five was too short. If it was over in five, it would mean they were—</p>
<p>No, no. Not five. Obviously not. Ten, then? It still felt too quick. Or was it too long? Ten minutes, with every mage in there throwing their best spells at the Golems?</p>
<p>After ten minutes, the fear in Ceria’s belly turned into spikes that tried to push themselves out from within. A little thought in her head began to whisper to Ceria. It was too long. They were taking too long. Wouldn’t she have noticed something, seen some change if the Golems were falling? If it was silent like this for so long, it would mean…</p>
<p>No, no! Illphres was an expert at drawn out battles. This was just playing into her hands. Ceria kept telling herself that. She’d be locking down the Golems with ice, creating fortifications they had to battle past. A long wait was good—they might have to wear down the metal knight Golem, or Cognita. It didn’t mean—</p>
<p><em>Drip.</em></p>
<p>It was a faint sound, but the only one in the corridor. Ceria whirled. She saw a single tear of water fall from the ceiling. It splashed with the faintest of noises in the corridor. She looked up.</p>
<p>The ice on the walls was melting. Illphres’ ice was beginning to melt, slowly gathering condensation into droplets that fell down around Ceria. A few fell around her, and then one landed on her neck.</p>
<p>She jumped as if she’d been struck. Ceria turned her attention back to the door, trying to ignore the melting ice. But it kept melting, more and more of it, as the chill lessened and the walls became slick.</p>
<p>The melted ice puddled on the stone floor, wet, cold. Ceria stared at the door as the last of the ice turned to water. Minutes passed, too many. She felt the water touch her shoes.</p>
<p>And she knew.</p>
<p>But she told herself she didn’t. Ceria lied to herself, promising her rapidly beating heart that the doors would open at any moment and Illphres and the others would come out, beaming, battered, but alive. They couldn’t be dead. They couldn’t be.</p>
<p>But soon the fear in her heart turned to a suppressed panic in her chest. Ceria wanted to scream, but didn’t dare to. She wanted to run, but there was no one to run to. The lie in her mind became something else. So long as the doors didn’t open they were alive. So long as the double doors were closed, they were still fighting. They were still—</p>
<p>The doors opened. Ceria stepped back from them and nearly slipped. She blinked her eyes, willing the figures to be Illphres, Jurix, Ophelia, Bastam and Qum—</p>
<p>Cognita walked out of the double doors, her stone body whole and undamaged. Ceria stared at her.</p>
<p>And her heart broke.</p>
<p>The Golem saw Ceria standing by herself in the corridor and stopped. She stared down at Ceria, and said not a word. At last, Ceria looked at the doors.</p>
<p>“Are they—are—”</p>
<p>She had to ask, though she knew the answer. Cognita nodded. She spoke softly.</p>
<p>“They failed the challenge. They are dead.”</p>
<p>“It’s not true.”</p>
<p>Ceria started towards the doors. She couldn’t believe it. It couldn’t be. Cognita could <em>not</em> be here, undamaged. She had to be injured, destroyed. She couldn’t be—</p>
<p>“Ceria Springwalker. I would advise you not to go within.”</p>
<p>“Let go of me!”</p>
<p>Ceria tried to push Cognita’s hand away, but the Golem was immovable. The half-Elf squirmed out of the grip and ran for the doors as Cognita let go. She pushed desperately on them, felt them give.</p>
<p>Ceria flung open the doors and stared at what lay beyond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pisces heard the scream and knew. In truth he had known thirty minutes ago what the outcome would be. It wasn’t anything the mages had shown him.</p>
<p>It was the look in Cognita’s eyes.</p>
<p>It was a small clue, but one the young man understood. He alone had talked to Cognita. He had seen how her face changed. Very little, but she too had expressions. She felt. And ironically, Golems were bad liars.</p>
<p>Cognita had feelings. She could feel passion for something, and he had seen her eyes change when he spoke of his ambitions, of what might be done with magic that had never been attempted before. He had seen the spark in her eyes.</p>
<p>But he hadn’t seen it as she strode into the chamber. She had known how the battle would end. She had taken the measure of her opponents and seen what would occur without fail.</p>
<p>If Pisces could have, he would have stopped the five mages. He nearly broke his spell of [Invisibility] to try, but one look into their eyes told him they wouldn’t be stopped. They didn’t care that he was there. They’d seen him, all of them, he was sure. And they’d known from his face what their chances were.</p>
<p>But they’d gone anyways. Because they couldn’t turn back. Because they were true mages.</p>
<p>And now they were dead. And Ceria—</p>
<p>He saw Cognita carrying the half-Elf out of the room. She fought the Golem, punching her, casting spells, but Cognita ignored her. Pisces heard Cognita’s voice as she told Ceria that if the half-Elf entered the room and fought the Golems she would be killed. And he saw her head turn and knew that was meant for him as well.</p>
<p>Pisces couldn’t look at Ceria as she collapsed on the ground. Instead, he slipped away when he saw the group of five lesser Golems enter the room and exit with bags of holding. He knew what they were doing.</p>
<p>He knew where they carried the dead.</p>
<p>Mages died in Wistram. Not as often as one might think, but enough so that it was not rare. Failed experiments, duels gone wrong, simple suicide or accidents like slipping down stairs—</p>
<p>And of course, those who failed the challenge. Pisces walked after the Golems, noting how other students passed them, oblivious to what the Golems carried. They were just things to most of the mages.</p>
<p>But the Golems had purpose, and they fulfilled all manner of tasks. Such as finding a place for the dead.</p>
<p>The catacombs of Wistram were extensive, dark, and off-limits for Pisces. For all students, really, but especially him. Two suits of armor stood guard on the entrance at all times, a hallmark of another time when the remains of one mage might be destroyed by an enemy.</p>
<p>But the remains of the recently deceased went to another room, where the process of decomposition was initiated by Golems. Only the bones would go below.</p>
<p>Pisces slipped into the room, unseen by the five Golems. He saw them emptying the bags of holding onto the stone slabs. The room was empty save for one dead student. Pisces saw a dead body with too pale skin and realized one of the Selphids must have evacuated it for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Six bodies, then. Pisces sighed softly when he saw the remains of the mages that had been alive not an hour ago.</p>
<p>Illphres, Bastam, Jurix, Ophelia, and Qum. Not all were recognizable. Not all were in one…piece. The Golems bent over their bodies, hands raised. Pisces realized with morbid fascination that they would disassemble the bodies without tools, only brute strength and unyielding fingers.</p>
<p>For a moment, the young man hesitated. He was uncertain, but he stood up as one of the Golems reached down for Bastam’s face.</p>
<p>“It is not right. It is not fair. But it must be done. So. <em>Rise.</em>”</p>
<p>The bodies jerked and came to life. The Golems paused, not comprehending as two of the six corpses in the room slowly stood up. Pisces felt the magic leave him and staggered. He drank a small potion at his side, cast the spell again. The mana in him burned as it left, but then six corpses were standing.</p>
<p>Not zombies. Not Ghouls, or any of the lesser undead. Burning eyes and flames in empty sockets stared back at Pisces as he looked at the six Liches, mages claimed by undeath to roam the earth.</p>
<p>Liches, yes, but more powerful than their skeletal counterparts. That was just magic used to reanimate long dead bodies. So close to death, these six fallen mages were stronger than Wights, more powerful than common Liches. They were as close to Revenants as he could make them.</p>
<p>The Golems turned towards the undead. They didn’t understand what had happened, but they had their orders. One reached for the thing that had been Illphres.</p>
<p>“Fight.”</p>
<p>The Golem fell backwards as a fist struck his chest. Pisces heard the stone crack and saw Illphres’ frail hands moving. She leapt at the Golem, faster than he had ever seen her move. Pisces saw the other Golems fighting now, reacting to the threat.</p>
<p>Too slow. Pisces let the undead knock the Golems down but didn’t bother trying to finish them off. Instead he turned and ran towards the door.</p>
<p>“Follow!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wistram was in uproar. Pisces ran down the steps, shouts and screams echoing behind him. The six dead mages followed closely, making no sound as they ran behind him.</p>
<p>He had hoped they wouldn’t be seen as he ran down the corridors, but there were too many students and mages about. But they’d made it. Pisces leapt down the last flight of stairs and gasped for air.</p>
<p>Ahead of him, a tunnel led up towards a gate, guarded by two huge shapes. Armored knight Golems. They blocked the way. Pisces pointed a finger and his undead leapt towards the Golems. They reacted swiftly, raising their swords and shields and charging into the battle.</p>
<p>Pisces ignored both sides. He ran on, using [Flash Step] to evade one of the Golems who tried to cut him as he passed. He had only one goal in mind as he broke the lock on the gate and ran through it.</p>
<p>The catacombs were dark. Ward spells shone in Pisces’ eyes, enchantments designed to prevent the dead from rising by siphoning the mana away. He ran past sarcophagi, alcoves in the wall, coffins and burial urns, searching frantically.</p>
<p>It had to be here. He knew it was here. All the books said—</p>
<p>There. Pisces stumbled into an open corridor and saw the tomb. It was a dark, thick stone slab covering a stone bed. There was only a single glowing line of text, written in an ancient language on the cover. Pisces couldn’t read it, but he knew what it said.</p>
<p>The grave of Archmage Nekhret, one of the true [Archmages] of Wistram. And the only one to be buried in this place. The others had died elsewhere, or left no bodies to bury, or at least no bones.</p>
<p>But Nekhret—Pisces stumbled over to the stone lid and <em>heaved</em> at it with all his strength. He couldn’t budge the heavy stone. Only when his four remaining undead ran towards him and pushed did the lid fall to the ground with a <em>crash.</em></p>
<p>Pisces knew he had to hurry. He knew he had only minutes before the mages would come, or the Golems to protect this place. But his breath caught as he saw the yellowed bones and the grinning skull of the former archmage. It was just a body. Just a body.</p>
<p>But the bones still glowed with power. Pisces reached out with trembling fingers and then remembered. He took out the small bag of holding he’d stolen from the Golems and reached out to take the bones.</p>
<p>The instant Pisces’ hand touched the first bone he felt the world <em>shift.</em> He cursed, looked around wildly. Then he realized the magic was coming from the stone coffin itself.</p>
<p>Something was growing out of it. Pisces cried out in terror and shoved the rest of the bones into the bag of holding. He stumbled away, his undead forming a wall around him as something appeared in the air.</p>
<p>A shadow blacker than color pulled itself out of the darkness. From underneath the coffin, more…<em>things</em> appeared. They drifted upwards, taking forms that were vaguely like real shapes and at the same time not.</p>
<p>Pure black made up the blade one of the apparitions drew. The blade glowed in the darkness, or rather, made the darkness shine around it. It was the antithesis of light, the shadow in every ray of light.</p>
<p>Slowly, the other summoned creatures drew weapons as well. They were undead, or perhaps something greater. Pisces knew it as he ran, leaving the bodies of the former mages to buy him a second of time. Nekhret’s last curse on those who would plunder her tomb.</p>
<p>He should have expected it. But Pisces hadn’t thought. He’d only known this was his chance. Now he ran as the apparitions flew after him, screaming with voices that made him throw up as he used [Flash Step] to dash up the stairs.</p>
<p>The undead stormed out of the catacombs as evening drew into night. The students of Wistram and mages heard their screams and turned to fight. Golems and mages alike battled the dark apparitions in the hallways, classrooms, and banquet halls, fighting to save their lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ceria sat in front of the doors leading to the room with the Golems, staring at it. Holding herself back from going in. She wanted to. She wanted to die.</p>
<p>Her master was dead. The other mages were dead. They had died, and the Golems remained. All of them. Each one was intact, each one whole. Ceria couldn’t remember—she had seen them lying on the floor—</p>
<p>The memory was too horrible for her mind to actively remember, but Ceria knew she had seen the four Golems before Cognita had pulled her back. Damaged, maybe, but all intact.</p>
<p>They were all still there. And the mages—her friends—Illphres.</p>
<p>Were dead.</p>
<p>Ceria wanted to go in that room. She wanted to cast her spells, fight for the few seconds she could. She knew she’d die. But she wanted to prove that Illphres had taught her. Prove she’d been right. Not that she’d done all this for nothing.</p>
<p>It was impossible. Ceria was just dreaming. She’d wake up and—and wake up in her bed. This was just a bad dream.</p>
<p>But it was reality. And although Ceria sat in the corridor for hours, wishing, praying, reality would not change for her.</p>
<p>In the end, it was someone else who made Ceria look up.</p>
<p>“Ah. You’re still alive?”</p>
<p>It was a voice Ceria had never heard, not once. She looked up and saw Amerys standing over her. Amerys, the Calm Flower of the Battlefield. One of the King’s Seven.</p>
<p>“Go away.“</p>
<p>The woman stared down at Ceria as the half-Elf clutched at her arms, hard enough to bruise her skin. She looked at the doors.</p>
<p>“Well, Illphres is gone now, is she? Too bad. I’ll miss her for morning practice. She was always the best at making barriers.”</p>
<p>That casual sentence, the simple acknowledgement of everything Ceria was denying, was too much. She leapt to her feet.</p>
<p>“<em>Shut up! Shut up!</em>”</p>
<p>Amerys looked at Ceria, calmly. Not with amusement or scorn, but with something as cold as Illphres’ ice in her eyes.</p>
<p>“She’s dead.”</p>
<p>“No, she’s—”</p>
<p>Ceria couldn’t lie. But she didn’t want to say it. Amerys studied her and shook her head.</p>
<p>“You know, she told me she was challenging the Golems tonight. She asked me to stop you from killing yourself if she failed.”</p>
<p>“She what?”</p>
<p>Ceria stared at Amerys in shock. The woman nodded.</p>
<p>“I would have come earlier, but I figured that you’d either be in that room by now, dead, or wallowing in misery out here.”</p>
<p>“But she—she didn’t think she’d—she was going to—”</p>
<p>“Change Wistram?”</p>
<p>Amerys snorted softly. Ceria choked. Now tears were falling from her eyes again. Amerys looked back at the doors and sighed softly.</p>
<p>“Perhaps she would have. But Cognita was too strong, wasn’t she? If I’d agreed to help, we probably would have died. Then again, maybe not. We’ll never know.”</p>
<p>“She asked you?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes.”</p>
<p>The woman nodded, meeting Ceria’s horrified stare.</p>
<p>“I told her no.”</p>
<p>“Why? She asked you and you said no? You—you <em>coward! </em>If you’d been alive, if you’d helped her—”</p>
<p>Ceria began screaming at Amerys. The woman shook her head, ignoring Ceria’s helpless fury.</p>
<p>“It was too risky. If there was a chance of me dying—I told Illphres I wouldn’t risk it. I told her to wait, even if it was for another decade, to challenge the Golems with ten times their number if they could. It turns out I was right.”</p>
<p>“She was brave! She was a true mage! She and Jurix and Bastam and the others—they had courage. You’re supposed to be a famous mage! Why didn’t you go?&nbsp; Are you afraid? Are all of the King of Destruction’s servants such cowards?”</p>
<p>It was only when Amerys’ eyes flashed with fury that Ceria realized who she was talking to. A living legend, the equivalent of any Named Adventurer. Amerys spoke softly, but her voice was filled with controlled…passion.</p>
<p>“Coward? I suppose that’s fair. But if I am a coward, it is for my King. Do not misunderstand me, half-Elf. I would go in that room and challenge the Golems alone if it were not for Flos, my liege.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>The woman turned away from Ceria. When she looked back over her shoulder, her eyes were shining with something similar to the look Ceria had seen in Illphres’ eyes.</p>
<p>“Because he is a king worth being a coward for. Because someday he will return. Make no mistake; someday I will be at his side and we shall challenge the Golems together. We will walk beyond those doors and see for ourselves the heights of magic. But until then I will do all I can to live until the day he calls for me.”</p>
<p>Ceria could say nothing to that. She let the tears run down her eyes as she stared at Amerys. The woman looked away and shook her head.</p>
<p>“Until that day I wait. Hah, it is hard to wait for him for so long. But he is worth it. My lord Flos is…and it isn’t as if there aren’t other dangers to fight in that time.”</p>
<p>“What do you…”</p>
<p>Only now that she was standing, looking at Amerys fully did Ceria see the cut on the woman’s leg. It had gone through her magical robes, cut into her flesh. It was bound tightly with gauze.</p>
<p>“You’re injured.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am.”</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>The Human woman looked at Ceria, not without a trace of pity. But only that. A trace. She pointed to the stairs.</p>
<p>“See for yourself.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were less than sixty dead in truth. Less than sixty, but over half as many wounded, some critically. To Ceria, descending the steps and walking through the hallways in numb silence, it was as if the rest of Wistram were a reflection of the death above.</p>
<p>The shades called by Nekhret’s spell had flown through Wistram, not hunting Pisces but setting upon every living being they could find with death and cold fury. The mages and students, unprepared, had fought back, but many of their spells had failed to affect the magical creations.</p>
<p>If it were not for Cognita, if it were not for the Golems and the Archmages and senior mages, Ceria later learned, the casualties would have been far higher. Most of the shadows and phantoms had flown into the banquet hall during dinner, and it was there the battle had been fiercest.</p>
<p>Only sixty had died. But one of those sixty lay on the ground of the banquet hall, amid the overturned tables and trampled food and drink. He had fallen mid-gallop, hands raised, a wand still held tight in one of them.</p>
<p>His face wasn’t calm. It was desperate, fierce. Ceria stared down at Calvaron’s body and looked into Beatrice’s eyes as the Dullahan held him.</p>
<p>“This is your fault.”</p>
<p>She told Ceria that, as Mons sat on the ground next to Calvaron. Ceria didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“Pisces.”</p>
<p>Beatrice turned away. Ceria stared at Calvaron until the Dullahan screamed at her. She wandered away, mumbling to people who asked if she was hurt. At some point she saw Cognita, organizing Golems as they helped tend to the dead.</p>
<p>She saw Pisces just once. He was imprisoned in a cage of magic, guarded by Golems who were there to protect him from the angry mages and students. He stared down at the ground, face pale. He didn’t see her.</p>
<p>The trial began that night and lasted well into next day. The charges were simple. Pisces had stolen the bones of one of the Archmages. He had plundered Archmage Nekhret’s tomb and unleashed her spell of retribution on the academy. All the dead were his fault.</p>
<p>The punishment was equally simple. The Council was split, many calling for banishment. Wistram had no jail. The others called for death.</p>
<p>Ceria watched the trial taking place, saw the outrage on the faces of the people around her. But she was numb to it all. News of what had passed above had spread, especially after it came to light how Pisces had reanimated the five fallen mages to break into the catacombs. That was a tragedy on its own, but the mages channeled their shock into anger against Pisces.</p>
<p>Many voices spoke up that night, all for killing Pisces. The mages that held out argued against the death penalty because it would tarnish Wistram’s image, because it was wrong in this day and age, because they didn’t have the stomach for it. None because they felt sympathy for Pisces. He kept his head bowed as students and mages hurled accusations against him, screaming.</p>
<p>Beatrice spoke, and then Mons. She didn’t plead for Pisces’ innocence. She just told the Council she had no idea what was happening, and asked that Pisces be punished. She didn’t say what that punishment should be. Montressa stared at Pisces as if he were something she had never seen before.</p>
<p>Ceria was the last one to stand. When she did, the room went quiet. The mages knew she had been Illphres’ student. They knew she had been there when they had challenged Cognita and the other Golems, and when the doors had opened. It was Illphres’ body and the others Pisces had used to reanimate. They waited for Ceria to attack Pisces. She wondered if they would stop her if she tried to kill him.</p>
<p>There was nothing in Ceria’s heart. She looked inside her for her soul, but found it missing. It lay back above, in a corridor frozen in time where the frost clung to the walls. And as Ceria stood before the Council she spoke what was in her heart.</p>
<p>“Ceria Springwalker.”</p>
<p>Archmage Feor, the hero of her people, stared down sympathetically at Ceria. She stared back blankly.</p>
<p>“You have known the mage known as Pisces the longest. He has wronged you perhaps most of all. Is there anything you would like to tell the Council regarding his fate?”</p>
<p>Ceria stared around at the august assembly of faces staring down at her. She nodded slowly. When she spoke, her voice was quiet, but magnified by the spell so it filled the room.</p>
<p>“There is something. If my master—if Illphres knew what Pisces had done with her body…she would have laughed. She would have laughed, and she wouldn’t have cared at all.”</p>
<p>The room fell silent. The mages murmuring to each other grew quiet as Ceria continued.</p>
<p>“Pisces? I know him. He was my friend. Once. I hate him for what he did to my master—for what he did to the others. I hate him so much I think I might kill him. But I hate the rest of you even more.”</p>
<p>She looked around the room, eyes burning.</p>
<p>“You knew they were going to challenge the Golems. You knew. They asked you—each one of you to join them. You all said no. So they had to go by themselves, only five of them. If there had been six, or ten—they might have lived. But they went alone, because the rest of you are cowards.”</p>
<p>Shock. Anger. It was all the same to Ceria. She stared around the room and addressed the Council of Wistram to their faces, called them what they were.</p>
<p>“You are all cowards. Fearful, small people, living in the shadow of the Golems. You won’t ever find true magic, not here. Not while Cognita and the Golems are the true rulers of this place. I’m leaving—I won’t stay here, hiding from the truth. So long as the Golems live, there are no true mages in Wistram. None, except for the dead.”</p>
<p>She turned and walked away. Voices shouted after her, but Ceria was deaf. She sat down and saw the Council restore order, begin to vote.</p>
<p>One more person strode into the room, unannounced. But she brought silence with her.</p>
<p>Cognita. She stood in front of the Council, the death of mages on her hands yet no trace of it marring her smooth exterior. Perfect, wrought of stone. Immortal. And she spoke for Pisces.</p>
<p>“I would ask you not to vote to execute this young student.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>The answer came from Feor. Ceria looked at him, and saw a trace of that fear in his eyes. In all the mages’ eyes. They looked at Cognita and saw something they could not surpass, did not dare to challenge. She addressed them calmly, her voice booming throughout the room unaided.</p>
<p>“Because it would be unjust. There have been other mages whose failed experiments have killed far more. There have been other students here who have committed greater crimes and been expelled for it. The death sentence has never been passed down for a true mistake made by a student. I argue for exile, not death. If you pass judgment, let it be for what he has done, not what he is. Necromancy is not a sin.”</p>
<p>Feor stared hard at Cognita.</p>
<p>“And what will you do if we vote to kill him?”</p>
<p>She replied calmly.</p>
<p>“I will do nothing. My role is to protect and serve Wistram and those who live within. But if you do decide to execute him, I will expect you to kill every student who errs thusly from now on.”</p>
<p>The mages murmured as she left. Pisces raised his head to stare after her. He saw Ceria staring at him and looked away.</p>
<p>In the end, the Council argued for hours, but voted. It was close, but those who voted for exile were slightly more numerous than those who voted for death. Feor stood on the podium, staring down at Pisces with contempt.</p>
<p>“For your crimes, we exile you. You will never set foot on Wistram’s shores again, under penalty of death. And this shall be spread across the world—no true mage of Wistram shall treat with you, Pisces.”</p>
<p>The young man didn’t look up. Feor’s gaze turned to Ceria’s and softened.</p>
<p>“As for you, Ceria Springwalker. You must leave as well. Pack your belongings. You will leave Wistram with the next ship.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few things happened in between the time Ceria spent wandering Wistram and the day she left. The half-Elf was attacked by Beatrice for defending Pisces as the Dullahan saw it, only saved by Mons. She was an exile among the other mages, none of whom spoke to her.</p>
<p>But one mage thought of her, or rather, her master. Amerys stood in front of the door that was still covered with frost and tried the handle. It didn’t work.</p>
<p>In the end Amerys gave up on waiting for a key to be brought and blasted the door open. The thunderous sound drew other students to her room. They backed away when they saw her exit the room, holding something in her hands.</p>
<p>“Here. Give this to Ceria Springwalker.”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“Do it. Or I will find out.”</p>
<p>Amerys thrust the ice-blue spellbook into the hands of one of the students in the crowd. He recoiled, but after she glared at him, took the book with trembling hands. Amerys strode away without a backwards glance.</p>
<p>The unfortunate Drake held the book in his hands, hesitating. He started down the corridor, but never got to Ceria’s room.</p>
<p>A young man stopped him in the hallway with some of his friends. The Drake and he argued. Gold was offered, then secrets. In the end the book was traded and it went with the young man.</p>
<p>Charles de Trevalier walked through Wistram, upwards, onto a balcony where Ceria had sat with Illphres once before. He stood on the edge over the open, looking down into the sea. Then he let the book drop down into the sea.</p>
<p>It splashed when it hit the water, and Charles saw the book freeze the ocean around it. It disappeared beneath the waves, encased in ice that refused to float or melt.</p>
<p>He turned around, smiling, and saw the Dullahan staring at him. Charles’ smile disappeared, but Beatrice said nothing. She turned and walked away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two days later, Ceria found herself standing in the entrance hall, waiting. The ship was here at last, ready to take them to Izril. It wasn’t her choice. This was the first ship and so she had to be aboard it.</p>
<p>Someone else stood in the entrance hall, far away from her. Pisces kept his head down as he clutched the few things to his name. A spellbook, and a small bag. Ceria stared at him but he didn’t raise his head.</p>
<p>No one had come to see her off. Montressa had stopped by her room. Beatrice had not. Ceria had seen a few other students as well, but the rest of the mages had avoided her as well as Pisces.</p>
<p>This was it. Ceria stared numbly at the doors and realized it was time. She was leaving Wistram, a failure. With nothing to her name but a few coins and memories.</p>
<p>“Hold.”</p>
<p>The word caught Ceria as she started towards the doors. It came from a tall figure, Cognita. She strode towards Ceria and stopped before the young half-elf. Ceria stared up blankly. Cognita inclined her head.</p>
<p>“Ceria Springwalker. I regret the death of Illphres and the other mages.”</p>
<p>“Do you really?”</p>
<p>Ceria said it numbly. Cognita nodded.</p>
<p>“I do. But I was created to protect and so I shall.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I hate you. I’ll hate you forever and I think you’re a slave. You don’t have will. You’re just a thing that pretends to sometimes be alive.”</p>
<p>“That is your choice.”</p>
<p>Cognita accepted Ceria’s statement without a hint of displeasure. She bent down to Ceria. Her eyes were intent on the half-Elf’s face.</p>
<p>“But I see in you something worthy. So I ask that you accept what comes next, and know that it is a sign of respect, not mockery.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Cognita didn’t answer. She strode towards the doors and threw them open. Ceria and Pisces shielded their faces from the sun’s glare.</p>
<p>“Step forwards, you two. Side by side.”</p>
<p>Unwillingly, Ceria did so. She stared at Pisces and he looked down. Cognita looked at both students and raised her voice.</p>
<p>Her words echoed throughout Wistram. They weren’t loud, not a shout, but they travelled through the corridors, into rooms, making mages stand up and go to the windows. Those that were already watching were joined by other mages as Cognita spoke to the academy.</p>
<p>“Today Wistram will see two students depart from its shores. These two mages leave, one exiled, the other in contempt. They leave as failures by the reckoning of the Council. But the Golems of Wistram disagree.”</p>
<p>She swept an arm out. Shading her eyes, Ceria heard Pieces draw in his breath. She looked out, down the winding stone staircase that led to the stone harbor and gasped.</p>
<p>Golems stood on the staircase. Hundreds of Golems. Stone ones carved to look like Humans or other races, suits of animated armor, creations Ceria had only seen once or twice. A Golem made of pure emerald stood next to one that seemed to be made of the wind itself. It stood next to a being of wood with moss and flowers growing out of its body. It held a sword out, saluting the air.</p>
<p>Cognita’s voice rang out again, and Ceria saw students and mages appearing on the stairwells and bridges above the entrance hall. They stared down at her as the Golem kept speaking, stared at her and Pisces.</p>
<p>“I am Cognita, greatest of Archmage Zelkyr’s creations. Though I am no mage, I hold his authority, which supersedes all others so long as I remain. Thus, it is within my power to graduate you two on this day. Ceria Springwalker, Pisces, you have shown the qualities of a true mage of Wistram, both of you. Neither of you will fall behind any other mage nor disgrace Wistram’s name. I hereby name both of you full mages of the academy.”</p>
<p>Ceria stared up at the Golem, barely able to comprehend what was happening. Pisces’ face was pale as he looked up at the Golem. Cognita smiled slightly, and motioned them forwards.</p>
<p>It was a dream. Ceria slowly began walking down the steps, Pisces at her side. She looked at the rows of impassive Golem faces, and saw how they were turned towards her. Watching her. As if they were alive.</p>
<p>“Golems of Wistram! Salute these young mages as they go forth into the world! Though they may leave these shores, they pass from here not as students, but as true mages!”</p>
<p>Step by step, the two descended. Ceria’s ears were roaring, and she saw the ship ahead of her, drawing closer. She stopped with Pisces only once and looked back towards the citadel. The doors were thrown open and a tall woman made of stone stood there. She raised her hand and her voice carried clearly to the two down below.</p>
<p>“Go, Ceria Springwalker and Pisces. Walk proudly as true mages of Wistram.”</p>
<p>Then she turned and the Golems began to file back into the academy or walked into the sea. Ceria turned and caught Pisces’ eye for a brief moment. Then she turned and boarded the ship and sailed away from Wistram.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is how the story ended. Ceria and Pisces took the ship for several days to Izril, seldom speaking, and not at all to each other. For their part, the [Captain] and [Sailors] treated the two mages with great respect. They had seen the Golems lining the stairs for the two mages—they were surely some of Wistram’s best.</p>
<p>The irony was not lost on Ceria, but she could only think about Illphres, about Calvaron, and felt the emptiness in her vanishing day by day. Not because she wanted to feel again, but because life was going on. It was as if she left that part of her with Wistram.</p>
<p>She knocked on Pisces’ door on the last day of their voyage, when land had been spotted. He let her in and she sat on a chair while he sat on the bed.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>He said that at last, looking up at her. Ceria just stared back until he looked down again. There was nothing he could say, and nothing she wanted to hear. She eventually said what was on her mind.</p>
<p>“Once we reach the shore, we’ll part ways. I never want to see your face again, understand?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>They heard sailors calling out overhead, guiding the ship in to dock. Pisces shifted, wiped at his eyes. Ceria saw tears. She had none herself.</p>
<p>“It truly—it truly was a wonderful place, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>She looked at him. Pisces was crying.</p>
<p>“It was just like my dream at first. It was everything I had hoped for. It was the place where I wanted to be forever. It was worth waiting for. Worth giving everything up for.”</p>
<p>Slowly, Ceria nodded. She stared past Pisces, seeing friends and memory, stone corridors, magic and sadness and happiness in the moment before she blinked. Then she did and it was gone.</p>
<p>“It really was.”</p>
<p>They sat in silence as the rocking ship slowed and they felt it stop. Ceria stood up and looked down at Pisces.</p>
<p>“Goodbye.”</p>
<p>She walked away, carrying the rucksack filled with the few things she had to her name. Ceria walked away from the ship that had taken her from her hopes and dreams, away from the young man who had once been her best friend.</p>
<p>But never would Ceria forget. In her dark dreams, in the moments when she sat around campfires with the new friends she made, in the days spent walking, footsore and tired, searching for a place to rest, she’d always think back on it.</p>
<p>An isle in the sea. A citadel of dark stone, standing in a bubble of calm while storms raged around it. Hallways full of magic, impassive stone golems, students and mages of every race. A place of wonder, of magic.</p>
<p>The place where mages gather. The home of sorcery.</p>
<p>Wistram.</p>
<p>The half-Elf walked away, and was lost in the night. And after a moment, the young man, the necromancer, stepped off the ship. He looked back once, and then he was gone too.</p>

		<p><em>The half-Elf walked off into the darkness, leaving Wistram behind. After a moment, Pisces stepped off the ship as well. He looked back towards the ocean where Wistram could no longer be seen, but where he knew it lay. Then he turned and was gone too.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story ended. Ceria looked up from the depths of her mug and saw two watery eyes staring back at her. She blinked and leaned back a bit. There was a bit of snot mixed with the tears.</p>
<p>“Um, Erin? Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine! I’m fine, it’s just—”</p>
<p>Erin reached for a handkerchief and wiped at her eyes. She had another one for her nose. Three, actually.</p>
<p>“And you never went back? Ever? You never heard from any of your friends, or—or sent a letter?”</p>
<p>“Never.”</p>
<p>Ceria shook her head, feeling the small gap in her heart aching a bit. But it was only a small rift, a faded scar that time had patched over. It had been a long time since she’d dared think about the past, but it had helped to tell someone at last.</p>
<p>“And so that Golem—Cognita is still in Wistram? And your friend Beatrice is all alone, and Montressa too? That’s so…<em>sad.</em>”</p>
<p>Erin blew her nose again and Ceria smiled crookedly. It wasn’t really a smile.</p>
<p>“That’s life. I wouldn’t be surprised if Montressa is a fully-fledged mage by now and far more experienced than both me and Pisces combined. But I don’t know. I never heard from them.”</p>
<p>“But it’s not fair! You weren’t the one who killed Calvaron! And neither was Pisces! I mean, it was his fault, but he couldn’t have known about the trap spell! And it sounds like the other mages treated him horribly!”</p>
<p>“He did practice necromancy.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but still—he only became a jerk after everyone started being a jerk to him, right? I understand so much more about him now!”</p>
<p>“I—wouldn’t take all of what I said to heart, Erin. Pisces did change thanks to how people treated him later on, but he was always a necromancer. He always kept secrets. Even from me.”</p>
<p>“I get it. But it’s still so tragic. It hurts just to hear it.”</p>
<p>Erin put down the soggy handkerchief and Ceria drank down the last dregs in her mug. Around them, a few late-night drinkers were being shepherded out of the inn by Maran, but Erin and Ceria were safe at their table in the corner. After all, Erin practically ran the inn even when Miss Agnes was around and Ceria didn’t have anywhere to be.</p>
<p>Of course, many miles away a lonely cart was rumbling down the road where three other adventurers were probably trying to sleep, but Ceria didn’t have to join them. Not tonight.</p>
<p>It had been Pisces’ idea. Fed up by sleeping on the wagon each night, despite the hand-delivered food and copious amounts of blankets and pillows, the mage had demanded one member of the group be allowed to sleep in the Frenzied Hare each night.</p>
<p>Ksmvr hadn’t cared, but Ceria and Yvlon weren’t entirely immune to the allure of the idea themselves. So the three of them had drawn straws to see who would go back the first night.</p>
<p>It had been Ceria who’d won the straw pick. She’d come back and been feasted by Erin while she watched a new play—something about a girl with a thick accent learning to speak correctly—being put on.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the important part of the night. The important part had come when Erin sat with Ceria and they had talked about the incredible mage they’d met. Ceria had asked Erin how she knew him, or rather how Ryoka knew him, and somehow that conversation had led back to the past.</p>
<p>To the past, and a story Ceria had never told anyone. How she and Pisces had first met, how they had become friends—</p>
<p>And how they had lost that and left Wistram. Now, in the quietest hour of the day, just past midnight, Ceria listened to Erin snuffling.</p>
<p>“It’s history now. If I could go back I’d do everything differently. But time travel is one of the things even the greatest of mages can’t do. My master, Illphres, died in the academy. I left because all that I respected and aspired towards died with her.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t want to stay? Even though…”</p>
<p>“Maybe.”</p>
<p>Ceria stared into the embers of the fire.</p>
<p>“Yes. I did. I regretted saying what I did to the Council. But—I still left because of what she said before she challenged Cognita.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The half-Elf shrugged, uncomfortably.</p>
<p>“It was just a comment. If she had been an adventurer, perhaps she would have known the danger she was walking into. That’s…one of the reasons I decided to become an adventurer. Illphres was far more powerful than most mages, far more powerful than I can dream of right now. But she died because she wasn’t used to fighting, not like adventurers are. We fight dirty and learn to run away. She and the other mages were proud. Too proud. I see that now.”</p>
<p>“But they sounded amazing.”</p>
<p>A sigh escaped Ceria’s lips.</p>
<p>“They were. I wish you could have met them.”</p>
<p>“But it sounds like Pisces was incredible too, wasn’t he? Before people knew he was a [Necromancer]—they really liked him, didn’t they?”</p>
<p>“Yes. They did.”</p>
<p>“I can’t really imagine that.”</p>
<p>Something like a laugh escaped Ceria’s lips. She turned to Erin, smiling in the dim light.</p>
<p>“It is hard to see, isn’t it? But just imagine Pisces without the sneer. Without any rude comments or—or his dirty robes. He is a genius at magic and Cognita herself acknowledged his skill. If we hadn’t fought those pirates at sea, if he had never been found out, he might be a powerful mage rising higher in Wistram right now.”</p>
<p>“Wow.”</p>
<p>More silence. Ceria saw the light in the room dim further, until Erin was just a dark silhouette in front of her. She could have cast a spell to light up the room, but this suited their conversation. After a while, she spoke out loud, confessing one last thing to Erin.</p>
<p>“That day, I think Cognita was speaking to Pisces, not me. He was the one who truly deserved to graduate from Wistram like that. I—I’m just a dropout. A failure. But I used the name of Wistram because it meant I could get work and it opened doors for me.”</p>
<p>“You’re not.”</p>
<p>Ceria shook her head.</p>
<p>“I am. A true accredited Wistram mage is a rare thing, with far more experience and a deeper understanding of magic. What that old mage said—you saw him trash us in moments. Regardless of whether the quality of mages has declined since Archmage Zelkyr, we’re still far below that standard. I am.”</p>
<p>Something touched Ceria’s hand. She jerked, but it was Erin’s hand. The girl squeezed Ceria’s hand gently. Her good hand.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you’re a failure. You went into Albez, didn’t you? And you came out.”</p>
<p>“Huh. I guess we did.”</p>
<p>Ceria smiled as the last light disappeared. She couldn’t see Erin’s face, but she knew the other girl was smiling too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day, Erin treated Ceria to a huge breakfast. Not the usual kind either—she’d made spiced porridge seasoned with a bit of fruit to go with mulled wine. It was hot, filling, and it made Pisces stop complaining when they brought it to the cart to be eaten on the road.</p>
<p>Erin sat next to Ceria as they ate from bowls on the bouncing wagon. Pisces and Yvlon looked cold but awake and Ksmvr seemed happy to wolf down the gluten-rich food with no side effects.</p>
<p>“I appreciate the effects of this magical charm. I wonder if it may be duplicated?”</p>
<p>“Probably. It’s such a low-grade enchantment even Springwalker could do it.”</p>
<p>Pisces remarked testily and got a kick and a glare for it. He rubbed his leg as he continued.</p>
<p>“It is possible, but why would you need a second artifact, Ksmvr? My understanding is that you are exiled from your Hive. Unless you have plans to join one of the Antinium Hives in the south?”</p>
<p>Ksmvr went very still as Ceria glared at Pisces. He shrugged insolently. At last, the Antinium spoke quietly.</p>
<p>“It is true that I have been removed from my position due to my incompetence. But I would never join another Hive. My true place—and my Queen—is in Liscor. I hope to return some day, bringing gifts such as this charm to prove my worth. But until I can prove myself useful, I will adventure with you. If I may.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded.</p>
<p>“Of course, Ksmvr. You’re a valuable member of The Horns of Hammerad.”</p>
<p>“And far better company than Pisces.”</p>
<p>“Hah. While Ksmvr’s presence may be more appealing, may I remind you that my abilities are unique within this group? No one can provide the unique skills and insights that I have at my—”</p>
<p>“Shut up, Pisces.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, shut up, Pisces! You were nicer back when you were in Wistram.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Pisces blinked. He stared at Erin as she frowned at him. Ceria sighed. She didn’t quite meet Pisces’ eyes.</p>
<p>“I told her about our time in Wistram last night.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr’s head swiveled from Pisces to Ceria as the young man blinked at Ceria and then went red. The Antinium opened his mandibles but Yvlon nudged him.</p>
<p>“Why did you nudge me, Comrade Yv—”</p>
<p>She sighed, pulled him over and whispered into Ksmvr’s earhole while Pisces cleared his throat a few times.</p>
<p>“Ah, Ceria told you about our shared history?”</p>
<p>“She did. She said you were a really nice guy, once. What happened?”</p>
<p>Pisces’ eyes flashed.</p>
<p>“Well, if she told you the truth, you would know that it was because of the unfounded prejudice and intolerance—”</p>
<p>“Because other people were jerks to you. I get it. But you still became sort of a jerk yourself, you know.”</p>
<p>Pisces had nothing to say to that. He just looked at Ceria, angrily, as if she’d given away a precious secret. She stared silently at him, meeting his eyes, until he remembered and looked down. Remembering the past made it harder to sit across from Pisces so easily for Ceria, though she’d made her peace with it all.</p>
<p>Erin glanced between the two, seeing the tension. She raised her voice.</p>
<p>“Um. I do have a few questions. I didn’t ask last night Ceria, but…you know, I think you made some of your story up.”</p>
<p>Ceria frowned at Erin.</p>
<p>“I did not.”</p>
<p>“I dunno…Pisces, you were there. Did Ceria’s master—Illphres—did she <em>really</em> destroy six ships all by herself? And did you and Ceria really fight two Trolls during the entrance exams?”</p>
<p>Pisces’ eyes flicked to Ceria. The half-Elf colored and looked over the wagon’s side.</p>
<p>“I…may have exaggerated some details.”</p>
<p>“Clearly. However, Miss…Erin, I would impress on you one thing. If, that is, Ceria told you how it ended?”</p>
<p>Pisces grew serious. He looked at Ceria as if to ask her what she’d told her. She raised her hand and a fiery creature drew a simple message in the air, in the code only they could read.</p>
<p><em>Everything.</em></p>
<p>“—Mages aside. Pirates aside. The Sea Serpent—assuming Springwalker told you there was only one? Yes, that might be exaggerated. But there is no description that can truly convey the power of Wistram’s true rulers. The Golems. Cognita was, and remains, the most powerful being I have ever encountered in the world.”</p>
<p>The wagon grew silent as everyone thought of that. Erin looked back down the frozen road.</p>
<p>“Even that crazy old man with the iPhone?”</p>
<p>“Well, we saw very little of his power. But…yes. The quality of his magic is meaningless against the Golems of Archmage Zelkyr. They were built for war. Mages may cast spells of incredible destruction, but few are suited to combat.”</p>
<p>He met Ceria’s gaze and then looked away again. After another second, Erin piped up.</p>
<p>“You took the bones of the [Archmage], didn’t you? You put them in Toren.”</p>
<p>Yvlon’s head snapped up. Ceria winced, and Pisces drew in his breath sharply.</p>
<p>“I did.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean he was powerful as an [Archmage]?”</p>
<p>“Hardly. And I didn’t use many bones. I only used four.”</p>
<p>“<em>Four?</em>”</p>
<p>Ceria stared at Pisces. He nodded fractionally.</p>
<p>“Four. I carved the spell into the bones, to restore the form I gave Toren no matter how badly he might be broken. They are…what makes him unique. But they consume too much mana for him to survive without a source.”</p>
<p>“I get it.”</p>
<p>Erin sighed. She sat back down in the cart and pulled a blanket over herself. She stared at the grey sky as no one said anything for several minutes.</p>
<p>“You sounded really cool, you know.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“You. Ceria told me about how you used to duel people, and cast magic. You sounded cool.”</p>
<p>Pisces opened his mouth. He closed it, swallowed, opened it again, and closed it once more. He closed his eyes. Then he spoke quietly.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“You’re welcome.”</p>
<p>The cart rumbled onwards, taking the Horns of Hammerad down the road. Occasionally they passed by wagons and called out greetings or asked about dangers on the road. But the adventurers just sat in silence, mainly, along with Termin who was used to just having the company of his own head.</p>
<p>It was a cold day, but they were warm enough. And so Ceria and Pisces sat on opposite sides of the wagon and remembered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the sun hit midday, the cart stopped to let the horses rest for a while.</p>
<p>“Even with a Skill they need a break, if only to eat.”</p>
<p>Termin explained as Erin happily patted one of the horses, Erma, on the head and she chewed her oats. Fox was busy trying to eat the food Erin had brought—warm bread and a spicy dip as a snack with cold meat and cheese for toppings.</p>
<p>“Shoo! You damn horse.”</p>
<p>Pisces waved it away as Ksmvr sliced cheese, cutting with little regard for the sharp blade of his dagger. Fox wandered away and Erin happily accepted a sandwich from Ceria before nearly dropping it.</p>
<p>“It’s <em>hot!</em>”</p>
<p>“Really? Sorry. I tried to tone down the heating spell, but it’s hard when one hand’s…”</p>
<p>Ceria waved her skeletal hand. Erin shook her head as she juggled the hot sandwich.</p>
<p>“No, it’s just that I wasn’t expecting it. Magic is really useful, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Best thing on a road.”</p>
<p>Yvlon smiled as she accepted a second sandwich from Ceria. She peered at Ceria’s hands as the half-Elf warmed another sandwich for Termin, trying not to scorch the bread.</p>
<p>“I thought you were a specialist at ice-magic, Ceria. Is it hard to cast flame spells?”</p>
<p>“I used to be quite good at earth and fire magic. It’s my master who taught me a bunch of ice spells.”</p>
<p>Ceria shrugged as she tossed Termin a sandwich. He bowed slightly to her and she grinned and waved a hand in reply.</p>
<p>“I have a few Skills that improve my ice magic, but it’s not like I can’t cast any spell I learn, Yvlon.”</p>
<p>“I see. Magic’s a mystery to me, so I wondered.”</p>
<p>“You never tried to learn?”</p>
<p>Ceria sat with Yvlon on the wagon, the only non-snowy surface, as Erin and Termin clambered on top as well. Yvlon shook her head.</p>
<p>“Not my thing. I had a tutor of course—most rich families have tutors who teach their kids all sorts of skills and find what they might be good at. I couldn’t figure out how to cast [Light] and neither could my older brother or my sister. Swinging a sword works well enough for me.”</p>
<p>“But it’s <em>magic.</em> If I could learn it, I’d be so thrilled!”</p>
<p>Erin sighed as she chewed her warm food. There was something special about eating in the cold and on the road, she decided. It gave her food…character. Then she remembered something else and slapped her head.</p>
<p>“I forgot! I was going to give you all some of my Corusdeer horn soup! My blue soup!”</p>
<p>The others eyed Erin.</p>
<p>“Your what?”</p>
<p>“Hang on! I’ll show you!”</p>
<p>Erin opened the door lying on the back of the wagon and crawled through it into Octavia’s shop. One of the [Alchemist’s] customers had a very nasty scare when he saw Erin crawling into the shop—from his perspective, it looked like Erin was crawling out of the sky, down through the doorway. But in a few seconds she had some of the soup she’d kept in a glass jar and was showing it triumphantly to the others.</p>
<p>Ceria and Yvlon stared hard at the soup adhering to the walls of the glass. It certainly looked blue, but that wasn’t a good thing. Blueberries were edible, and so was blue cheese, but there was something about blue soup that made it look particularly nasty.</p>
<p>The wagon driver shook his head the instant Erin uncorked the bottle and offered the soup around. All the ingredients had become a gelatinous mess from sitting in the bottle for so long, and the fact that it was still steaming didn’t make it any more appealing.</p>
<p>“I’m not eating that.”</p>
<p>“Aw, come on!”</p>
<p>Erin tried to get him to take a bite, then Yvlon. At last Ceria tried it, but only after Erin had taken a few bites and not immediately thrown up.</p>
<p>“It’s…dead gods, it’s not bad, Erin, but it doesn’t taste that great either.”</p>
<p>Ceria mumbled around the mouthful before she swallowed. The soup was hot going down, and that too felt wrong. But after a few moments, the half-Elf blinked and gasped.</p>
<p>“It’s <em>hot!</em>”</p>
<p>“See?”</p>
<p>Erin beamed around as the others stared at Ceria. The half-Elf’s cheeks had flushed and she was starting to sweat.</p>
<p>“It’s way too hot. Erin, is that soup magical? I have cold protection spells on—I feel like I’m in an oven!”</p>
<p>“Oops. Sorry.”</p>
<p>Ceria shook her head as she examined the soup with renewed interest.</p>
<p>“You made magical soup? I can’t believe it.”</p>
<p>“It’s great! And I think I can make an actual dish next time, not just soup. But this stuff is going to be a huge hit—you can drink it and you won’t feel the cold even if you’re naked!”</p>
<p>“Tested it out, have you?”</p>
<p>Yvlon sighed but took a few bites. Termin did too, and in a few moments everyone was walking around and shedding clothes, standing in the snow and remarking at the way it melted on their bare skin.</p>
<p>“You’ll make a fortune off it—assuming you can sell a lot before the winter ends. Is it expensive?”</p>
<p>“Not too much. But I’ve got other soups and stuff as well! Funny—I always have to make it into a soup first. After that I can figure out how to combine stuff, but soup is easiest to experiment with.”</p>
<p>Erin offered Pisces the last bit of the blue soup. He declined, letting Ksmvr consume the rest of the enchanted food.</p>
<p>“Enchanted cooking is a rarity even in Wistram. I suspect your products will do very well, especially given the difficulty in reproducing a recipe such as this from taste alone.”</p>
<p>The innkeeper smiled wickedly.</p>
<p>“Yeah. No one’s stealing <em>this</em> recipe.”</p>
<p>“I feel like I could lie about in the snow all day. But I suppose I’ll settle for a nice breeze while riding. Time to be off!”</p>
<p>Termin clambered aboard the driver’s seat and called to the others. Erin, Ceria, and Yvlon got on top, but Pisces declined.</p>
<p>“I will walk.”</p>
<p>Everyone stared. Yvlon, Ceria, and Ksmvr had all walked to stretch out, but up till this moment Pisces had refused to expend one bit of energy more than necessary. Termin just shrugged and shook the reins lightly.</p>
<p>“Your choice. Just don’t fall behind, necromancer.”</p>
<p>Erin laughed. Erma and Fox began pulling the wagon, faster than a walk but so slowly that Pisces would be able to catch up quickly.</p>
<p>But the mage didn’t immediately walk after the wagon. Instead, he stayed where he was. Sitting on the wagon back, Ceria frowned. She was about to call back at him when Pisces took one step.</p>
<p>Snow whirled. It flew up into the air in a gust, following the mage. He blurred forwards—too fast to really be called movement at all—and appeared right next to the back of the wagon.</p>
<p>Erin gasped.</p>
<p>“[Flash Step]! That’s the spell, right?”</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>Ceria watched as Pisces stood still next to the wagon, letting it continue onwards for about five seconds. Then he took a step and appeared next to it in a moment. He looked up, and his eyes met Ceria’s. Both mages looked away.</p>
<p>From her seat, Yvlon frowned at Pisces before looking at Ceria.</p>
<p>“I saw Pisces using that spell in the ruins and in the battle with that old mage. I didn’t know there was a spell like it until now. It looks incredibly useful. Do you know it?”</p>
<p>Ceria shook her head.</p>
<p>“It was one of his specialties. It’s a good spell for movement, but very hard to use. One bad step and you can break your foot or your toes.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Pisces continued to follow the wagon. At first Erin kept staring at him, gasping a bit as he blinked forwards with each step, but quite soon she grew tired of the spectacle. Ceria didn’t, though. She knew what Pisces was doing.</p>
<p>He was training.</p>
<p>With each step, Pisces kept pace with the wagon. It was slow, monotonous, and, Ceria knew, had to be mentally draining. But the fact that Pisces could keep performing the spell over and over was a sign of the skill she’d told Erin about.</p>
<p>What was amazing was the accuracy. At first it was off—Pisces would teleport too far ahead and spook the horses, or end up a few feet behind the wagon—but as time went on he eventually started appearing right at the back of the wagon, each and every time.</p>
<p>That was unusual, and Ceria knew both Yvlon and Ksmvr could tell how impressive that feat was. The wagon didn’t move at a uniform pace and the road wasn’t always straight. Pisces had to calculate how far to step at a distance in order to land precisely where he wanted to go.</p>
<p>After a while, Pisces added to the exercise. He drew his rapier from its sheathe and walked slowly forwards with it on the balls of his feet. Each time he stepped now, it was into a thrust, as if he were stabbing an opponent in the heart.</p>
<p>Now Pisces would step forwards into a slow lunge, fully extending his back leg while all the weight rested on the front. He kept his arm still as he held the rapier extended as far as he could go. Pisces slowly stepped out of the lunge, blurred forwards and moved into it again.</p>
<p>Slowly. Ceria could see his arms shaking the fourth time he did it, and he began to sweat despite not having had any of Erin’s soup.</p>
<p>After thirty minutes Pisces had to stop. He could barely raise his arms, despite alternating them while lifting the rapier. He collapsed onto the back of the wagon, panting as he pulled a blanket over to wipe his forehead.</p>
<p>“Wow. That looked really hard.”</p>
<p>Erin offered Pisces a pillow and he sank his head onto it, exhausted. He nodded, too tired for sarcasm.</p>
<p>“I am out of shape. It has been a long, long time since I last…”</p>
<p>“Not bad. You have excellent form.”</p>
<p>Yvlon handed Pisces a water flask. She looked at him with a touch of respect. He nodded wordlessly as he drank deeply from it.</p>
<p>“It is a shame the Antinium cannot learn magic. I believe I would benefit greatly from mastering such a spell.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr remarked as he stared at Pisces’ rapier. Ceria shook her head and saw Yvlon and Termin both doing it as well. For all she liked Ksmvr as a person, the thought of thousands of Antinium using [Flash Step]—or a basic spell like [Stone Dart]—was a nightmare.</p>
<p>Pisces shook his head as he handed the water flask back to Yvlon.</p>
<p>“Your species has a distinct absence of any kind of magical affinity, Ksmvr.”</p>
<p>The Antinium nodded calmly.</p>
<p>“Yes. This has been well observed and is a deliberate factor of our creation. Moreover, since the Antinium do not level greatly, magic has not been seen as a viable field to explore for our species.”</p>
<p>“Good. The last thing Wistram needs is Antinium mages running around.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I suppose seeing a few Antinium sitting in Rievan’s class would be quite amusing, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Pisces glanced sideways at Ceria. She couldn’t help but grin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a few hours Termin called out to the half-dozing adventurers and Erin sitting in the back of the wagon.</p>
<p>“There’s the city. I heard it was abandoned and then retaken. Should we go around, do you think?”</p>
<p>“What city? Oh—”</p>
<p>Erin gasped as she stood up on the wagon. Ceria reached to steady her, but then stopped as well. Yvlon sighed softly as she spotted the distant buildings. Familiar, and yet alien now.</p>
<p>“Esthelm.”</p>
<p>It was more of a whisper. Erin peered at the walls, clearly damaged from a distance, and the way many buildings were only partly standing.</p>
<p>“Whoa. It looks messed up.”</p>
<p>“Well? Go around or go to it?”</p>
<p>“I heard my brother had helped retake the city. I’d like to ask about him, if we can.”</p>
<p>Yvlon turned to the others. Ceria nodded.</p>
<p>“To the city then, Mister Termin. We can probably rest there for the night.”</p>
<p>“So long as they don’t look too hungry. The last thing I need is a bunch of starving folk trying to eat Erma and Fox…”</p>
<p>Termin grumbled as he drove them onwards. The closer they got, the more Erin could see the damage that had been done to Esthelm. The damage, and just as notably, the repairs.</p>
<p>“Looks like they’ve patched up the wall pretty well. And it’s manned.”</p>
<p>Ceria noted the Humans standing on the battlements with bows. Their wagon had already been spotted and she could tell people were eying her back as well. Esthelm was vigilant after two Goblin attacks it seemed.</p>
<p>“Not only that. Look—they’re reinforcing it.”</p>
<p>Yvlon pointed down the wall, where work was clearly being done to expand the fortifications and add onto them. Pisces sighed as he stared at the burnt and ruined buildings.</p>
<p>“I suppose we won’t be resting in luxury here. It might be best to camp outside of the city if all the buildings are in such a state of disarray.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see when we get in. But at least we can eat at Erin’s inn.”</p>
<p>“True! And we can stay there if Termin finds a place to put his horses for the night.”</p>
<p>“Oh no.”</p>
<p>The wagon driver crossed his arms firmly.</p>
<p>“I won’t sleep anywhere away from Erma and Fox. They get agitated if I’m not close by and I won’t risk them being stolen. One of you’s got to stay here at least.”</p>
<p>“I volunteer.”</p>
<p>“Good for you, Ksmvr.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Ksm!”</p>
<p>“You are a valuable member of the team. Exceptionally useful, I must say.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr nodded modestly as the others thanked him warmly.</p>
<p>“I volunteered for the position because I believed I was most suitable for the job. Guard detail is a position of merit, but I will understand if anyone wishes to trade places with me.”</p>
<p>Soon, the wagon was in hailing distance of the walls. Termin shouted up at the people shouting at him and after much shouting and arm waving, the gates were opened and the wagon rolled in.</p>
<p>Yvlon spoke to the others before they got out of the cart. She’d tugged a cloak around her head, covering up her bright hair and covering her face.</p>
<p>“When we talk to people, let’s just mention we’re adventurers passing through on guard duty. If we can avoid using my name—or our group’s name—I’d appreciate it.”</p>
<p>“Why? Is it because of your brother? Ylawes?”</p>
<p>Ceria frowned at Yvlon. The young woman nodded, looking unhappy.</p>
<p>“I’d prefer not to meet him at the moment if we can. He could be troublesome.”</p>
<p>“Define troublesome, if you please. Dangerous?”</p>
<p>Yvlon shook her head, frowning at Pisces.</p>
<p>“No. He’s not a threat—so long as he doesn’t meet Ksmvr for the first time alone I guess. But he’s…”</p>
<p>Erin nodded.</p>
<p>“I understand. Lips sealed, right everyone?”</p>
<p>They looked at her. She sighed, exasperated.</p>
<p>“Don’t you get it? This Ylawes guy. He might be a nice guy and all, but he’s still her older brother.”</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“So he’s going to be an <em>older brother.</em>”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Ceria and Pisces nodded in understanding, despite Ceria not having any siblings to speak of. Ksmvr just tilted his head.</p>
<p>“I do not understand. Pisces, please explain—”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“So this is Esthelm.”</p>
<p>Erin stared around at the ruined buildings, at the people in dirty clothes, helping to lift timber, board up buildings, repair, dismantle, clear rubble and make weapons. There were men and women and children helping to fletch arrows amid the confusion, and more still coming in with game they’d hunted.</p>
<p>“It’s a mess.”</p>
<p>Yvlon kept her voice low as she glanced with sympathy at the citizens. Many looked hungry, but none looked as if they were starving. If they had, Erin would have given them what she could, or gone to Celum for food, but the people here were…strange.</p>
<p>They were ragged yes, hungry, yes, and dirty. But they weren’t beaten. They worked together with purpose, helping to rebuild their city as the wagon trundled into the center of the city.</p>
<p>A man bustled up to the wagon with a few armed citizens following them. Ceria was worried how they’d react when they saw Ksmvr, but the man in charge—some former [Soldier] by the look of him, wearing thick leather armor—didn’t blink more than once.</p>
<p>“Adventurers? Are you escorting the wagon?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Is the city…safe?”</p>
<p>Termin asked nervously. The men were inspecting the wagon, staring at the single door on the back of the wagon and the blankets and pillows in some confusion. The man in charge nodded.</p>
<p>“That’s right. We fought off the last Goblin army that attacked this place and we’re not going to let a third one get past our walls again. We’re surviving, but we need supplies. We’ve asked for help from the other cities, but Celum, Wales, Remendia…they’re all claiming the roads are unsafe to send supplies down. So until we can get help we’re on our own.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Is it bad?”</p>
<p>The soldier turned his attention to Erin. She was staring at some children hauling nails in a bucket to some carpenters. He shook his head.</p>
<p>“Not bad, Miss. But I’m afraid that we might have to confiscate your wagon’s cargo if you’ve got anything we can use. We’re in dire need of food, blankets—”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing in here, Umbral!”</p>
<p>One of the men shouted to the man in charge. He frowned and looked at the empty back of the wagon.</p>
<p>“You don’t have <em>any</em> food or supplies? Where’s your cargo?”</p>
<p>“It’s her.”</p>
<p>Ceria pointed to Erin and the young woman waved.</p>
<p>“We’re escorting her to Liscor. She’s an innkeeper, so she doesn’t have much coin. It’s a favor—”</p>
<p>“But we do have food! I can get some—and you can have all the blankets and pillows! I’ll get more as well!”</p>
<p>Out of the corner of her eye, Ceria saw Erin pointing at the door and hoped that Umbral didn’t understand what Erin was saying. Fortunately, the man just looked confused. He tried to stop Erin when she started handing pillows and blankets down.</p>
<p>“We wouldn’t want to take your only supplies, Miss. We’re not robbers—we’ll pay a fair price—”</p>
<p>“Take it, please!”</p>
<p>“A place to sleep would be payment enough, sir.”</p>
<p>Ceria interrupted Erin and she saw Yvlon pull Erin back and whisper to her. The blankets and pillows disappeared fast, and Umbral directed them to some of the sturdier buildings in the city.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about your horses, or your wagon. I’ll see to it that no one tries to make off with either. You can rest assured—we’re past thievery and attacking each other here.”</p>
<p>He waved them on. Ceria sat back with a sigh as Erin drooped into the wagon seat beside her.</p>
<p>“I can’t give them clothing and food and stuff? But they need it!”</p>
<p>“If they knew we had a door that could open a portal back to Celum, they’d take it, Erin. I’m sorry, but we’re not going to be able to use it tonight. It’s too risky.”</p>
<p>“I almost want to give it to them.”</p>
<p>“That would be an unforgivable waste.”</p>
<p>Pisces glared at Erin, outraged at the very idea. She sighed, but nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“Too bad. I guess I’ll stay with you. Maybe we can help fix stuff? I can clean—I’ve got a Skill. Or maybe I can cook? I guess we can’t go sightseeing. Everything’s in ruins!”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t once. There used to be quite a lot of buildings here.”</p>
<p>Ceria looked around at the ruined facades, wondering if she could see where the Adventurer’s Guild had stood. Yvlon was silent too. The last time they’d been here was an age ago, when they had all met to debate going into Liscor’s dungeon. Back then Calruz and Gerial had been alive and…</p>
<p>In the end, the Horns of Hammerad found themselves staying in a former inn now housing citizens alongside visitors. They had to sleep three to a room and Pisces found himself sharing a space with Termin and Ksmvr, much to his distaste. Termin opted to sleep in the stables, though, and Ksmvr agreed to go with him.</p>
<p>For the rest of the night Erin helped the innkeeper—an overworked, balding man who had a big scar on his right shoulder that was still healing—manage the inn. He nearly cried when he realized she could cook better than he could and happily surrendered his kitchen to her.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much Erin could make with what few supplies were available to the city, but she made some potatoes and deer meat into a filling stew for everyone and found herself serving a vast number of people. When word got out she could cook, more food came in with requests that she make it for this group of people, or feed this family.</p>
<p>In the end, Erin only got to rest with the others when it was long since dark. She sat on a table, wishing there was a place to take a bath or shower in the city and knowing there was not.</p>
<p>“I can’t thank you enough for your help. Your stew went down excellent and you fried that meat to perfection.”</p>
<p>Umbral complimented Erin. She raised a thumb up and smiled weakly.</p>
<p>“Happy to help. How have you all managed to survive like this?”</p>
<p>He looked tired, but determined.</p>
<p>“It hasn’t been easy. We had a lot of help, mainly from our city’s savior. Ylawes Byres and his Silver Swords.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Erin saw Yvlon sit up a bit. The woman cleared her throat carefully.</p>
<p>“Will you tell us what happened?”</p>
<p>Umbral was only too happy to, and once the other citizens realized he was retelling the story they had to add their own accounts of what had happened, arguing with each other over the details.</p>
<p>The story was simple. After the Goblin attack, Esthelm had fallen into chaos. People had killed each other over scraps in the city and bands of thugs had fought with each other. The undead began rising since they hadn’t been buried and a second Goblin army had come to use them in some twisted scheme.</p>
<p>And then, Ylawes had come in, a&nbsp;literal knight in shining armor. He’d rallied the hearts of the people in the city and helped them fight back both undead and Goblins. With his help—and a timely rescue by a group of adventurers led by the other two members of his Gold-rank group, the Silver Swords, they’d fought the Goblin army off and begun rebuilding the city.</p>
<p>“Wow! Your brother is a hero!”</p>
<p>Erin whispered that to Yvlon as the citizens led them to a monument in the center of the city. It wasn’t a statue—that was coming, according to Umbral, but there was a plaque celebrating Ylawes and his party.</p>
<p>Yvlon stared at the plaque silently. She seemed…distant, to Erin. Not unhappy, but not aglow over her brother’s success either.</p>
<p>“He’s always been a hero. I admire him greatly, Erin. Although I wish he’d not risk his life like this.”</p>
<p>“I guess I understand that. But he did save everyone. And—hey, what’s that?”</p>
<p>There was a second monument next to the one for Ylawes. This one was a grave of all things. Erin didn’t know how she felt about someone being buried right in the center of the city, but she was struck as she stared at the plain tombstone.</p>
<p>“Flowers?”</p>
<p>The grave was blooming with flowers despite the hard soil. Erin stared at it, wondering who it was for. There was no inscription.</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s the strangest thing.”</p>
<p>Umbral explained when Erin and the others returned to the inn and asked about it.</p>
<p>“It marks, well, a young woman. A…hero, I suppose. She fought and died fighting the Goblins. And she was…Human. I think. That’s what Ylawes said, and so we buried her as such. Her and the Goblins who fought for her.”</p>
<p>“Goblins?”</p>
<p>“They fought against their kind. And the undead. Don’t ask me why. But if it hadn’t been for them killing that damned skeleton with the purple eyes, I don’t know what would have happened.”</p>
<p>Umbral didn’t notice the way all the adventurers and Erin went quiet at this. He shook his head after Yvlon asked him whether Ylawes was still in the city.</p>
<p>“He went north, after leaving a group of those adventurers to help guard the city. Lazy pigs they are, too, not helping at all unless there’s a monster about. Not like Sir Ylawes.”</p>
<p>“Did he say why he went?”</p>
<p>“He was looking for his sister. Some adventurer—Yvlon Byres. Apparently he heard she was wounded and came south looking for her.”</p>
<p>Erin bit her lip, but Yvlon just thanked Umbral and changed the topic.</p>
<p>“Do you think we’ll get to Liscor tomorrow?”</p>
<p>Erin asked Termin before they all went to sleep. The wagon driver nodded, yawning and grinning at her.</p>
<p>“We’ll get there before nightfall, don’t you worry. I plan on having myself a good rest before heading back north. Maybe I can supply these folks with food and supplies? I reckon I could make a good profit. I don’t suppose you have room for me and my horses in your inn, do you?”</p>
<p>Erin smiled widely at Termin. She gave him a quick hug, making the old man blush.</p>
<p>“Of course I’ve got room! You’re welcome to stay as long as you want! I can’t wait to get back.”</p>
<p>As everyone retired to their rooms, Erin wondered if she should ask Yvlon about her brother. But Yvlon wasn’t in the mood for talk, and so Erin eyed the bed, trying to figure out if she and Ceria and Yvlon could all squeeze in or if someone was getting the floor.</p>
<p>As they all squeezed in together, Erin whispered to Ceria.</p>
<p>“Ceria?”</p>
<p>“What is it, Erin?”</p>
<p>“Are the people here going to be okay?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Well, Ylawes is gone. What if the Goblins come back?”</p>
<p>“They’ll fight.”</p>
<p>That came from Yvlon. Her voice was calm, distant, bordering on the verge of sleep.</p>
<p>“They survived two battles with Goblins. Every citizen in the city will have levelled from that. People will have gained classes, levelled up, learned to fight…if a city doesn’t fall, it gets stronger from each disaster.”</p>
<p>“Oh. That’s good.”</p>
<p>After a while Ceria spoke to Erin.</p>
<p>“Do you think Lyonette survived without you?”</p>
<p>Erin shifted uncomfortably—sleeping with someone else in the bed was not normal for her, but the other two women were used to company when necessary. She started to shrug and stopped before she shouldered Ceria in the face.</p>
<p>“She might. I just hope all the walls are standing when I get there. Oh well. Once I’m back, everything’s going to be a-okay!”</p>
<p>With that in mind, Erin went to sleep. The next day, the Horns of Hammerad set out for Liscor. They arrived just before evening as the sun was beginning to set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Lyonette woke up, she knew today was going to be a busy day. That was because all of her days were busy now. But she didn’t groan or stay asleep. She just got up, smiled as she pulled the blanket over Mrsha and the Gnoll curled up into a ball, and got to work.</p>
<p>Now that the Wandering Inn was busy, Lyonette found that being an innkeeper, or standing in for one, was a ton of work. Rather, she’d realized how hard just keeping an inn afloat was before now, but now she worked from dawn to dusk without pause just to keep everything running.</p>
<p>The first thing Lyonette did was haul water from the stream. She did it before the sun had risen in the sky, swearing as she hauled the heavy buckets up the slippery, snowy hill into the inn. And then she went down and did it again.</p>
<p>Her new guests drank a <em>lot </em>of water. And while Lyonette could melt snow, it was faster to haul buckets up to get a good supply going. Then she had to rekindle the fire before she could start cooking and that took time too.</p>
<p>And then of course there was actual cooking. Lyonette sweated over food for the morning, but eventually made a big pot of pasta and sausage to go along with the assorted eggs, ham, and fried potatoes and boiled greens for breakfast.</p>
<p>It was a lot of food, but she now had many guests. And as Mrsha thumped down the stairs Lyonette saw the first of her guests come down now.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Mister Shivertail!”</p>
<p>“I told you to call me Zel. Mister and Shivertail aren’t my name at all.”</p>
<p>Zel Shivertail smiled at Lyonette. He sniffed the air and his tail twitched appreciatively. Mrsha’s was thumping the floorboards.</p>
<p>“Is breakfast ready? Don’t hurry on my account.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s ready! We’ve got pasta, fried potatoes, ham, eggs—Mrsha! Stay out of the kitchen!”</p>
<p>The Drake laughed.</p>
<p>“I’ll have some pasta for breakfast, why not? But first I need to use the restroom. Excuse me.”</p>
<p>“Oh—sure!”</p>
<p>Lyonette half-turned as she grabbed Mrsha to stop the Gnoll from running into the kitchen. Mrsha looked disappointed as Lyonette sat her at a table and got plates, utensils, and cups for both her and Zel.</p>
<p>“You sit, understand? You can eat with Zel—after you wash your paws!”</p>
<p>The young woman put no plate out for herself. She knew her other guests would be coming down the stairs soon, now that the smell of food was in the air. She just hoped she’d made enough!</p>
<p>Zel walked back into the inn with a gust of fresh air. Lyonette realized she’d forgotten to refill a bucket with water to wash with, and hurried to do that. She no longer questioned Erin anymore—</p>
<p>Lyonette corrected herself. She no longer questioned Erin just for being someone not born of royalty, but she had to wonder if the other girl had ever anticipated actually having guests in her inn.</p>
<p>Erin had a wonderfully large inn, magnificently crafted with glass windows no less, but it was missing some essential parts.</p>
<p>For instance, more than one outhouse. If there were more than four people living in the inn, having at least two seemed essential to Lyon, but Erin had never mentioned it. Plus, the outhouses were hardly big enough for some of her guests!</p>
<p>Poor Moore the half-Giant had had to find his own place to do his business for the first day, until Lyonette had talked to Pawn. The second outhouse was no bigger, but the third, temporary one was and Moore was quite happy with it.</p>
<p>There were nine private rooms in the inn, a very large number, but just enough for all the adventurers plus Zel, Lyon and Mrsha to sleep in if Mrsha and Lyon shared the same bed. Now that Lyon’s inn was full of guests, she found that once one person woke up, they’d all be up within the hour.</p>
<p>“Good morning!”</p>
<p>Lyonette called out as the first sleepy person tromped downstairs, lured by the food Zel and Mrsha were happily devouring together. Jelaqua Ivirith smiled slowly at Lyonette, and the girl smiled back, despite the slight chill she got when she saw that the Selphid’s host body had a bloodless open gash on her cheek.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Lyonette. Please don’t mind the injury. I know it’s distracting, but I didn’t have time to fix it last night.”</p>
<p>“Oh—it’s no problem! Would you like to have something to eat? We’ve got pasta, eggs, bacon, bread, potatoes, ham—”</p>
<p>“All that? I’ll have a portion of ham, then. With potatoes on the side. And can I get some of that honeyed milk? And some more honey on the side?”</p>
<p>“Right away!”</p>
<p>Lyonette bustled into the kitchen, calling out greetings as more adventurers descended. Some, like Seborn and Ulrien greeted her quietly, but others were grumpier in the morning. Revi and Typhenous looked upset to be awake; Halrac just looked grumpy.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Miss Lyon.”</p>
<p>Moore was always polite. Lyon smiled up at him and told him what was on the menu.</p>
<p>“Anything you can have the most of, Miss Lyon. I try not to be picky.”</p>
<p>That was one of the reasons why she needed so much food. Moore being half-Giant meant he ate three times as much as any of her other diners, hence her extensive preparations. But he never complained no matter what he ate; indeed, he was always polite, always seemingly grateful for the care Lyonette took to make sure he was fully fed.</p>
<p>Another thing Lyonette had noticed was each one of her guest’s personalities, their likes and dislikes, but also how they functioned as a group.</p>
<p>Griffon Hunt reminded her of the groups of elite soldiers she’d seen relaxing off duty in the palace or on the streets. Halrac and Ulrien were professionals, Halrac grumpy, Ulrien quiet and serious. Revi and Typhenous were typical mages in a sense, somewhat arrogant and condescending, not to mention picky when it came to relaxing, but equally competent at their job.</p>
<p>They argued a lot. Revi usually had a different opinion than Halrac, and the other two members had their own opinions. But Griffon Hunt settled their arguments by collective vote and for all their dysfunction, they were one solid team when it came to fighting.</p>
<p>The Halfseekers on the other hand were more like friends, and far more accepting of each other’s opinions. They had to be, Lyonette supposed. They were all outcasts in some way.</p>
<p>“<strong>Thank you for the food, Miss Lyon.</strong>”</p>
<p>Seborn nodded to her as she brought over his plate of eggs and bacon, and two pitchers of water. He drank as much as Moore ate, to keep his aquatic parts hydrated.</p>
<p>“No problem. Would you like more honey?”</p>
<p>“Please!”</p>
<p>Revi and Jelaqua raised their hands and then stared at each other. Jelaqua smiled and Revi looked away.</p>
<p>Honey was a very popular treat among all of Lyon’s guests. With Lyon too as well; sweet things were a luxury and she loved a bit of honey with bread, or in her milk, or with almost anything, really. But Jelaqua liked honey more than anyone but Mrsha and Revi. She claimed Selphids loved the stuff on Baleros.</p>
<p>Revi just had a sweet tooth. Lyonette came over to their table with a small gravy boat full of honey and smiled at the four adventurers.</p>
<p>“Everyone doing okay?”</p>
<p>“We’re quite happy, thank you.”</p>
<p>Ulrien gave her a rare smile which made Lyonette beam. Halrac just grunted and Typhenous blinked and scowled at his plate. Lyonette hesitated, and then asked a question that had kept her up last night.</p>
<p>“I hate to ask, but…is it Griffin Hunt or Griffon Hunt?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>They looked at her. Lyon blushed a bit.</p>
<p>“It’s just—I’ve heard your name several times, but I kept wondering if it was spelled, uh Griffin or…”</p>
<p>It was Halrac who answered, with an even rarer smile. His was ironic.</p>
<p>“You have a good ear. We’re Griffon Hunt. Not Griffin as in the beast. We’re named after a breed of dog used for hunting, which is what we specialize in.”</p>
<p>“Really? <em>I </em>didn’t know that.”</p>
<p>Revi leaned over the table, staring at Halrac.</p>
<p>“But you and Ulrien used to hunt actual Griffins.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. But we’re named after the dog?”</p>
<p>“Why in the name of silk would you do that? No one I know thinks you’re named Griff<em>on</em> Hunt!”</p>
<p>“It’s a play on words. I didn’t come up with it.”</p>
<p>All eyes turned to Ulrien. He raised his hands.</p>
<p>“Not me. It was another member of our group.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“She’s dead. It doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>Halrac scowled, and that was it for the conversation for the day, Lyonette knew. She let the adventurers talk and troop out of the inn while she went over to the Halfseekers with a jug of milk.</p>
<p>“Anyone want more milk? Or honey with that? How about seconds?”</p>
<p>“I think we’re good, thank you Lyon.”</p>
<p>Jelaqua smiled again, and Lyon beamed. It made her happy that the adventurers actually smiled while staying here. She knew she had never smiled during breakfast when she was young, only complained about the food.</p>
<p>But both groups of adventurers were happy here. Halrac especially—he and the team of Griffon Hunt were pleased not to be spending so much coin—she’d heard him talking about how they were getting better service for a fraction of the cost ‘that damned Drake’ had charged. And the Halfseekers were happy to find an inn where they weren’t treated with suspicion or fear.</p>
<p>But a good inn was in the end just a place where they could be safe and sleep. Within twenty minutes of sitting down, all the adventurers were ready to go. They trooped out the doors, headed for the city or the dungeon and Lyonette cleaned up. Mrsha carried some plates too—mainly to lick them when she thought Lyon wasn’t looking—and Zel carried his dishes and Mrsha’s to the kitchen, despite Lyonette objecting.</p>
<p>“I’ll be heading into the city too. Would you like me to drop off a list of anything you need bought?”</p>
<p>“Thank you, but I think I’m good for today!”</p>
<p>He nodded and went out into the cold. Lyonette shivered a bit, and then got back to cleaning.</p>
<p>Washing dishes and getting the kitchen ready was another exhausting task. At least she only had to make food for Mrsha and herself for lunch. Sometimes she had to feed everyone then as well, which was very tiring.</p>
<p>Lyon had a moment to spare around midday, which made her pause and sigh in relief. Normally she’d be sorting the things she’d had bought from the city—the Gnoll Runner usually carried it up on a sled about now.</p>
<p>Since that fateful day when Mrsha had fallen into the dungeon—the day Lyonette thought of as a near disaster and the rest of the city thought of as a momentous occasion where a new route into the dungeon had been found—she’d been sort of unbanned from entering the city.</p>
<p>It was tricky. Lyonette was fairly certain that if she went through the gates, no one would stop her. The Drake [Guardsmen] certainly wouldn’t, although she wasn’t sure if the Gnolls would. Zel Shivertail’s influence had granted her some kind of pardon, but Lyon didn’t want to test it unless totally necessary, so she just sent shopping lists into the city with coin when she needed food or supplies.</p>
<p>Now she bought directly from Krshia, and the Gnoll came over sometimes to talk with and teach Mrsha. She rarely said much to Lyon, but she had taken a greater interest in the young Gnoll, although she’d said that she didn’t have time to teach the young Gnoll much. And as Lyonette had learned, none of the other Gnolls were willing to get near Mrsha, much less teach her.</p>
<p>After a little while spent resting and then more time outside, playing catch with Mrsha and letting her run about after a small ball like a dog—although this one threw the ball back—Lyonette went back inside to fix a small problem she had.</p>
<p>It was that she had too much food. Ironic, that. Lyon bought in bulk now, in order to feed her guests. She had the funds for it—the adventurers and Zel paid a lot to stay here and none of them were tight with their coin. But there was a finite amount of room in the kitchen pantries to accommodate all the things Lyon bought, and she wondered if there was other space in the inn.</p>
<p>Zel found Lyon as she was opening a room she barely knew existed. He peeked over her shoulder as she stared into a supply closet.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>She whirled, jumping in surprise.</p>
<p>“You scared me!”</p>
<p>“Sorry.”</p>
<p>He smiled at her without exposing his teeth. Zel sat down tiredly as Lyonette peered inside the closet.</p>
<p>“I think this is some kind of…well, it’s too small to be a proper storage place. I wonder why it’s here. Oh, are you done with your tasks in the city?”</p>
<p>“For today. But there’s going to be a lot more, if all the [Message] spells I’ve been receiving are any clue. I’ve had to talk with Zevara, the local heads of all the Guilds…it’s a mess.”</p>
<p>Zel sighed. Lyonette wanted to go get him some tea or something stronger, but she’d spotted a small crack along the floorboards. She peered at it suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Is this…because of the Antinium? The new ones, I mean?”</p>
<p>Lyonette didn’t know much about the new Antinium that had sent Liscor into a frenzy, but she knew the one with the blue chitin had helped save Mrsha. That made Lyon trust her at least, but she had also heard the stories of the Antinium Wars and was uneasy about this sudden development. As was, it seemed, the continent.</p>
<p>“Yes. All the cities want to know what’s going on. They’re arguing, and it’s getting very political with Ilvriss around. But I’m also meeting to discuss the issue with of Goblin Lord and this dungeon.”</p>
<p>“Are you part of this city? I mean, do you live here or…?”</p>
<p>“No, but I feel responsible. And I try to help where I can, so I do. It’s a pain, though. Drakes can’t do anything without arguing over it endlessly, and like I said, when it gets political…”</p>
<p>“A lot of Human kingdoms are like that too. Or so I’ve heard.”</p>
<p>“Hah! At least there they don’t declare war on each other when a council member insults the Captain of the Watch’s tail. Or do they?”</p>
<p>“It can get pretty bad.”</p>
<p>Lyonette grinned ruefully as she shifted things aside. Yes, the hairline crack <em>was</em> there, and on purpose. She had a feeling she knew what it was and tried to pull things out of the way.</p>
<p>There was a sack of flour and other miscellaneous objects piled up on top of it. Zel came over and helped Lyonette shift everything out of the small space. She smiled at him.</p>
<p>“Thank you. Now, what’s this…?”</p>
<p>There was a trapdoor in the small closet. No, not a closet, but an entrance. Lyonette pulled at the ring and after a moment the trapdoor came up.</p>
<p>“What’s this? A basement?”</p>
<p>Zel and Lyon stared down the dark steps leading down into, yes, a basement of all things! Lyon was amazed—she took a few hesitant steps down and then had to cast the [Light] spell. It was one of the few she’d been taught as a child and it illuminated the very big, very empty basement.</p>
<p>“I had no idea this was here!”</p>
<p>“You didn’t?”</p>
<p>The Drake general walked down the steps, staring at the empty stone room. He pointed.</p>
<p>“Look, there’s places to store grain, shelves…this place is huge! Why hasn’t it been used?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know about it! And Erin—I don’t know if she did either.”</p>
<p>“Erin? That’s the innkeeper who owns this place, isn’t it? Why didn’t she know about the basement?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think she knew. Or if she did, she might have forgot.”</p>
<p>“I can’t say I’m too impressed with this innkeeper of yours.”</p>
<p>Zel frowned as he stared around the basement. He looked sideways at Lyonette.</p>
<p>“She seems not to care about leaving you—and Mrsha—alone for so long, and with no coin or help, no less!”</p>
<p>“She does care! She’s just—distracted. And she gets into trouble, sometimes. I think she just found something—or got into a problem—and couldn’t come back. I mean, she cares a lot even if she does weird things…”</p>
<p>Lyonette tried to defend Erin, although she realized her arguments were less than compelling. Zel frowned, unhappy.</p>
<p>“I’d like to have a word with her when she gets back. She <em>is</em> coming back, isn’t she?”</p>
<p>“That’s what Selys said. Um, would you mind if I asked you to help carry some stuff down here?”</p>
<p>“I would be happy to help. And you can tell me more about this strange Human.”</p>
<p>In the end, Lyonette told Zel about Erin while they carried a good amount of foodstuffs and supplies down into the basement. He snorted when he heard about her antics with the sleigh, Toren, and all of the other incredible and insane things Erin had done.</p>
<p>“I’ve fought alongside people like that. Distracted geniuses, prodigies without common sense…they tend to win some battles spectacularly and get torn apart in skirmishes they should easily win. I try not to have them in positions of command if I can. They’re not reliable in a pinch.”</p>
<p>“Well…she did save me. And though I was horrible to her, she never gave up on me.”</p>
<p>“That’s a redeeming trait, not an excuse.”</p>
<p>Lyon didn’t have an answer to that. In the end, they closed the basement trap door and only opened it when they realized Mrsha was trapped down in there.</p>
<p>“I told you not to play around!”</p>
<p>Lyon scolded Mrsha as the Gnoll raced back upstairs. Mrsha flattened her ears, but then glanced towards the door and sniffed at the air. Lyon put her hands on her hips.</p>
<p>“Hungry? I guess I should start making dinner, then! Everyone’s going to be coming back and probably starving after fighting monsters in the dungeon for so long.”</p>
<p>“Stressed out, too. It’s a hard job they have. This dungeon is filled with traps and rooms that keep changing. Even if they can bypass some of that and get into a new area, the way down is treacherous and there’s no easy escape. They need to take things carefully and meanwhile a bunch of inexperienced adventurers are going in and getting themselves killed or finding trouble.”</p>
<p>Zel explained the issue to Mrsha and Lyonette as she brought him a mug of ale. He drank at it as Mrsha kept sniffing the air. Lyon was about to ask what was wrong when Mrsha suddenly sat up on her chair and <em>howled.</em></p>
<p>It was sudden and made Lyon spin around in a panic. Zel was on his feet in a second. He stared out the window carefully, back against the wall.</p>
<p>“Mrsha, what is it, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Lyonette bent to Mrsha, but the Gnoll was suddenly filled with excitement. She hopped on the table and howled again, louder.</p>
<p>“It’s no monster. She’s not afraid.”</p>
<p>Zel relaxed as he observed Mrsha. Lyonette covered her ears—indoors the howling was insanely loud! Then he heard a distant howl from the city.</p>
<p>“Is that…Krshia?”</p>
<p>The other Gnoll had taught Mrsha how to howl, in some sort of Gnoll method of communicating. Lyonette didn’t know if it was the other Gnoll’s voice, but the instant Mrsha heard it she stopped howling.</p>
<p>“What was all that about?”</p>
<p>Lyon had no idea. She bent over the shards of the mug, picking them up gingerly, when she heard voices from outside.</p>
<p>“Oh? Are they back already?”</p>
<p>She started towards the door. But it was flung open before she could reach it. Mrsha leapt off the table and barrelled through it. Lyon heard a shout, a female voice, and then—laughter.</p>
<p>Her heart stopped and then began to beat faster in her chest. Lyon heard a female voice, a young woman’s voice, laughing, and Mrsha’s excited noises.</p>
<p>“Mrsha! Calm down. It’s good to see you! Please get off. Please?”</p>
<p>Lyonette saw a shape in the door. She walked forwards slowly, and then saw a young woman standing in the light. Erin Solstice beamed as she walked into her inn, holding Mrsha in her arms. She blinked when she saw Lyonette, and blinked twice at Zel, but then smiled at Lyon.</p>
<p>“I’m back! Hey Lyon, did you miss me?”</p>
<p>The girl, the [Princess] and [Barmaid] and single living employee of the Wandering Inn, stared at Erin in silence for a moment. Then her eyes filled with tears and she flung herself at Erin and hugged her fiercely. And as Erin yelped in surprise and the adventurers and wagon driver accompanying her exclaimed, and the Drake general inside laid eyes on the owner of the inn for the first time, word began to spread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first it came with the howling outside the city. Few Drakes heard it, but the Gnolls raised their heads. And they heard the howl coming from Krshia, and knew.</p>
<p>One of the Gnolls on duty mentioned it to Relc, who flipped a table and upset the card game he was losing badly at.</p>
<p>“Erin’s back! Hey! Call the game off! Erin’s back! Where’s Klb?”</p>
<p>It spread to the Watch Captain, who sighed, put her head in her claws, and groaned.</p>
<p>“This is all I need.”</p>
<p>It was already in the marketplace. Selys jumped up and down excitedly as Krshia smiled.</p>
<p>“She’s back!”</p>
<p>Across the street, a young Drake nearly knocked over an entire display he was helping his uncle with.</p>
<p>“Erin’s back!? I have so much to show her!”</p>
<p>Lism grumbled as he watched his nephew sprint off.</p>
<p>“It’s just one more damn Human. Who cares?”</p>
<p>The Antinium cared. Pawn, Belgrade, Bird, Anand, and Garry all heard the news as one of the Workers delivered it. They unanimously elected Pawn, the only free member of their group, to go above and see her at once.</p>
<p>“And bring back food. Please?”</p>
<p>“I will. And I will be sure to petition Klbkch that we all might go visit her!”</p>
<p>Of course, Klbkch already knew Erin was back. He’d known the instant she passed into the floodplains around Liscor. He sighed as he stood in his small room and looked up towards the ceiling.</p>
<p>She was back.</p>
<p>“I take it this is good news?”</p>
<p>Xrn studied Klbkch as they sat across from one another. He nodded at her.</p>
<p>“Yes. Very good news. A Human girl—the innkeeper I had told you about—has returned to the city. I am afraid we must put off your discussion so that I might greet her.”</p>
<p>“You astonish me.”</p>
<p>The other Antinium’s voice was frankly shocked.</p>
<p>“You would put aside a conversation between us—the reason the Hives have sent their delegation here in the first place—for a single Human girl?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes. Because she is important.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes. And her presence here means…well, I believe things are going to become interesting once again.”</p>
<p>Xrn looked at him askance.</p>
<p>“You mean they aren’t already?”</p>
<p>“Not yet.”</p>
<p>“You have visitors from four Hives, a Drake [General]—Zel Shivertail no less—in the city, a Lord of the Wall and a new dungeon plus two Gold-rank teams and Humans streaming into the city while a Goblin Lord roams the countryside. And this Human is what you think will make things <em>interesting?</em>”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Klbkch smiled. He looked up towards the surface, and wondered, for the first time in a long while, what would happen next.</p>
<p>“She’s back. Erin Solstice is finally back.”</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Erin Solstice had returned. That phrase meant little to most people living in or around Liscor. The vast majority of Drakes, Gnolls, and newly arrived Humans did not know this young woman. They would not have cared about her returning if they did.</p>
<p>But it was curious that in a city that housed over ten thousand souls above ground and almost the same number underneath how many people <em>did </em>know of Erin Solstice. And yet, that knowledge wasn’t consistent among species. Few Drakes knew. And of those that did, only a handful were friends with Erin.</p>
<p>More of the Gnolls knew of the girl, if only by name. But most had never met her. They simply understood of her existence in the larger framework of ambitions, triumphs, and failures that was part of their tribe’s struggle to justify their place in the city. The Silverfang Gnolls heard the howl, but they let their leader decide what would happen next. She was still the one in charge, even if much of her authority had been lost.</p>
<p>And the Humans? It could be said that of all the adventurers, the ones that mattered knew Erin. Two Gold-rank teams heard the news. One group was merely interested and wondered if their place in the inn would be compromised. But the others were surprised to see one of their members, Halrac, smile.</p>
<p>Less than a hundred people above ground knew Erin’s face. But below the earth, the Antinium knew her name. Even if they had never seen her before, every Worker, and now every Soldier knew her. Because she was significant. She had spoken to the Queen. She had made some Individual, and she was known to the Hive’s Revalantor. She was special.</p>
<p>But Zel Shivertail knew none of that. All he had were his eyes, the few things he had heard about Erin, and the things he had seen. The things that she had left behind. His understanding of her was formed by absence, by seeing what she had not done and the people who knew her.</p>
<p>So he stopped in the center of the inn, the Wandering Inn, and saw Erin Solstice return. He heard her laughing, and then her exclamation as Lyon rushed at her.</p>
<p>“Whoa! Hey, Lyon! Lyonette? It’s good to see you but—are you crying?”</p>
<p>“You’re back!”</p>
<p>“I am, I am. But could you let me go? And Mrsha—”</p>
<p>The innkeeper was caught between the young Gnoll with white fur who was climbing all over her, and the young woman who was almost beside herself with emotion. Fear, relief, surprise—</p>
<p>More people crowded the doorway. A half-Elf helped pry the Gnoll off of Erin while Lyonette let go and sheepishly stepped back.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. It’s just—you’re back!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I am. Thanks, Ceria. And—wow, who’s this?”</p>
<p>The girl came further into the inn and saw Zel. She looked at Lyon and the girl hurriedly explained.</p>
<p>“That’s one of my—your guests! He’s staying here.”</p>
<p>“Guests? I have guests? You mean people are sleeping upstairs? Who?”</p>
<p>“Not right now—there’s actually two groups of adventurers sleeping upstairs at the moment. Every room is full—”</p>
<p>“What? You mean there’s no space for us?”</p>
<p>A male voice shouted from outside the inn, sounding outraged. The speaker stomped into the room, a Human young man in dirty robes.</p>
<p>“Calm down Pisces. There might be space—we could sleep in the common room. And even if there’s not, there’s plenty of room in the city. Probably.”</p>
<p>A female Human, a warrior by the looks of her, wearing light leather armor walked in after that. Zel noted her gear—worn material, but ill-fitting on her. Probably a new purchase. And the young man and half-Elf’s robes marked them as mages. Adventurers?</p>
<p>Then someone else followed the group into the inn. An ant-like creature with an armored blackish-brown carapace and three arms. Zel’s claws clenched together before he made himself loosen his grip.</p>
<p><em>Antinium.</em> The thing made Zel want to leave, or start a fight. But he held himself back. Why was one here?</p>
<p>“Pardon me Captain, Erin, but Termin is asking where his horses can be rested. Is there a stable nearby?”</p>
<p>“A stable? Why would I have that?”</p>
<p>“Most inns have a stable, Erin.”</p>
<p>“Really? Oh yeah! Um. No, I don’t have one Ksmvr. I guess Termin’s going to have to put his horses in the city. Sorry!”</p>
<p>“I will convey that to him with tact.”</p>
<p>The Antinium walked back out. Zel couldn’t believe what he’d heard. That Antinium had a name? And it was—an adventurer?</p>
<p>Nothing made sense. But now the young woman was approaching him with a smile. Zel took a few steps and met her in the center of the room.</p>
<p>“Good evening, Miss. My apologies, I don’t believe we’ve met. My name is Zel Shivertail.”</p>
<p>Erin stared up at the tall Drake, blinking a few times at him.</p>
<p>“Whoa. You’re tall. Um. Hi. I’m Erin Solstice. I sort of own this inn, but I’ve been gone…wait, did you say Shivertail? Are you related to Selys?”</p>
<p>Zel’s nonexistent eyebrows rose.</p>
<p>“You know my niece?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, she’s one of my friends! That’s so weird!”</p>
<p>Erin stared round-eyed at Zel for a moment, and then came back to the topic at hand. She coughed a bit nervously. Zel realized he was looming a bit and tried not to. This young woman seemed, well, a lot like what he’d expected.</p>
<p>That was unfortunate.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve been gone for a little bit. There was an uh, accident, but I’m back now! I hope Lyon—I mean, Lyonette’s been treating you well? Getting you food and cleaning the inn and stuff?”</p>
<p>It was a question, not a statement, and Zel noticed that too. He made himself smile at Lyon as the girl looked nervously at Erin.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t have asked for better hospitality while I’ve stayed here. Your employee has done an excellent job, Miss Solstice.”</p>
<p>“Call me Erin! And that’s great! Good job, Lyon. Let me just look around…um, make yourself at home, Zel! Ceria, Pisces, I guess put your stuff over there—I just want to check…”</p>
<p>She passed by Zel and he saw her enter the kitchen. Lyon followed after her, looking suddenly very anxious. Mrsha ran after both Human girls and Zel heard Erin exclaiming as he eyed the adventurers. They seemed to be discussing this new revelation near the doorway—the Human [Mage] was giving Zel the fisheye, although the Drake [General] doubted any Human would recognize him without an army at his back.</p>
<p>“Hey, nothing’s broken! And the inn isn’t burned down! Everything’s alright! Good job, Lyonette!”</p>
<p>Zel’s eyes narrowed fractionally. He glanced towards the kitchen and saw Erin come out of it. Lyon looked relieved. The girl was chattering to Erin as the young woman poked around the rest of her inn.</p>
<p>“I tried to keep everything like it was, but I had to put the blankets and…stuff on the ground somewhere else. I’ve been purchasing food, but I tried not to spend too much coin! Um, I kept it—”</p>
<p>“Yeah, cool. Did you make food? By yourself?”</p>
<p>“I did. It’s not very good…”</p>
<p>“See, I tried to teach you! Did anyone get sick? And wait—”</p>
<p>Erin stopped and stared at one part of the room. She hurried over and then exclaimed in horror.</p>
<p>“Hey! What happened to my <em>flowers?</em>”</p>
<p>She rushed over to the boxes of dirt standing at the windowsills. Zel saw Lyon grew pale. The girl hurried after Erin, wringing her hands as she tried to explain.</p>
<p>“I forgot. I’m <em>so </em>sorry. I just didn’t think of them until recently. But when I did I tried to water them, and some have started to sprout. But I found out something about the flowers. You see, when you were gone I was looking for food for the Antinium and—”</p>
<p>Erin interrupted the other girl brusquely. She fussed over the small yellow flowers, not looking directly at the girl. She was clearly upset, but she only bit her lip as she turned to face Lyonette.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, Lyon. I guess…you know what? It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have gone. I can save some of them, I think. And I mean, I shouldn’t have expected you to…well, it’s too bad. That’s all.”</p>
<p>There was a tone of condescension in Erin’s voice that irked Zel. She was treating Lyon as if the girl were completely incompetent. Zel remembered Lyon saying she had been a fool before, but that was not her now. And Erin didn’t see that.</p>
<p>“I’m really, <em>really</em> sorry. But I managed to use some of the dead flowers! I have more honey—I can show you!”</p>
<p>Lyon wanted to get Erin to follow her back into the kitchen, but the girl had turned back to the flowers.</p>
<p>“Honey? I’ll go see in a moment. Why don’t you uh, well, why don’t you help out, Lyon? You can get some water or something. I’ll make dinner in a bit, and then I’ll talk to all these guests…you’ve been feeding them and making beds and stuff, right?”</p>
<p>“But I—”</p>
<p>Erin turned back to face Lyon, frowning now. She took a deep breath as Lyon went still, looking uncertain.</p>
<p>“Look, Lyon, I’m really glad you’re not being a jerk anymore, but let me finish with this, okay? I can see…whatever it is you’ve done in a bit.”</p>
<p>With that, Erin went back to her flowers, checking each one for damage. Lyonette stepped back and Mrsha ran around her legs. She opened her mouth, and closed it before looking at her feet.</p>
<p>She looked hurt. And that was what made Zel act. He walked over, wondering if he’d regret this when he got kicked out. But he had to say it. Erin was too busy fussing over her flowers, so Zel tapped her politely on the shoulder with one claw.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Miss.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Erin felt the tap on her shoulders and turned. Her heart jumped a bit in her chest as she saw the huge Drake, Zel Shivertail, Selys’ uncle, staring down at her. It wasn’t that he was a Drake, or really big that bothered her. It was more the expression of displeasure on his face.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Miss.”</p>
<p>“Um. Hi. Can I help you?”</p>
<p>He was slightly scary. Maybe it was the scars, the places where his scales didn’t join together quite naturally, or Zel’s huge, muscular body. He wasn’t quite as…thick as Relc, but he was clearly a warrior as well. His green scales were tinted a bit grey, but what really distinguished him was his aura. In that, he had one.</p>
<p>He seemed like a rock. Or maybe it was a pillar? He projected something solid that made him hard to ignore, or forget. He wasn’t the kind of person you’d want angry with you.</p>
<p>But he was angry or upset with Erin, for some reason. She tried to smile at him, but he wasn’t smiling back.</p>
<p>“Is…something wrong?”</p>
<p>He was probably upset, even though he’d said those nice things about Lyon. Erin worried the girl had made a ton of mistakes while she’d been gone. True, the inn was in one piece and everything looked good, except for the flowers, but Lyonette had to have screwed up something. Had she borrowed money to keep the inn supplied? And why wasn’t Mrsha with Selys? Erin had countless questions she wanted to ask the girl in private. She had no idea why Lyonette had been silly enough to take in guests when she couldn’t cook or…or Erin wasn’t here.</p>
<p>“How should I put this?”</p>
<p>Zel stared down at her, frowning at Erin as she shifted uncomfortably. She saw Ceria looking up from her side of the room with a frown, but Erin waved a hand at her friend.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter? If it’s something Lyon did—I can fix it!”</p>
<p>“That is precisely my problem, Miss. I would ask you to please stop dismissing Miss Lyonette so casually. You do not understand what she has done, and you are acting quite rude to her.”</p>
<p>Across the room, the Horns of Hammerad went silent. Erin froze.</p>
<p>“No I’m not.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you are.”</p>
<p>The Drake’s eyes bored into Erin’s.</p>
<p>“I realize it isn’t my place to lecture you, but I cannot sit still and say nothing here. It is my understanding that you own this inn, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Um, yes—”</p>
<p>“In that case, why did you leave this young woman alone, without any guidance? You have been absent from your inn for weeks. While you have been gone, this young lady has had to do everything without you, and with barely more than a handful of coins. If she had not been so resourceful, she might have starved or been hurt. I trust you know she was banned from the city?”</p>
<p>“I—I do, but—”</p>
<p>There was no getting a word in edgewise, Zel rolled on, staring hard at Erin as he continued speaking.</p>
<p>“Lyonette took matters into her own hands. Yes, she made mistakes, but you owe her respect, not condescension. She took care of your inn in your absence. She obtained food, even stole honey from Ashfire bees. She looked after this young Gnoll—and she even rescued her when Mrsha was in trouble. She offered me a place to stay and she has kept this inn in business. I don’t suggest she has taken your place, but she deserves your respect and acknowledgment.”</p>
<p>When he was done, no one could speak. Erin’s gaze had gone past Zel’s—she couldn’t meet his eyes. She looked over, and saw Lyonette standing to one side, and lower down, Mrsha staring reproachfully up at Erin.</p>
<p>Lyonette’s face was beet red and she was avoiding looking at Zel or Erin. For her part, Erin felt her cheeks igniting. Because, although it stung and she felt a bit angry at being lectured, she knew Zel was right.</p>
<p>He was like a grampa, although he wasn’t as old as one. But he was like a grampa in the sense that he was reassuring, oldish, and calm—until he got mad. Then it was like Erin was a kid again, being scolded by an adult. Because she’d made a mistake and she had to be told off.</p>
<p>But what did she say now? The uncomfortable moment dragged on, no one speaking. Zel had folded his arms, and Erin felt like she had to speak.</p>
<p>But what could she say? Now that she thought about it—now that the exhilaration and relief at returning had worn off and she was thinking, she could really see that this inn was fine. Great. Extraordinary, even.</p>
<p>The tables were clean. The floor was clean. There was a fire in the fireplace. The dishes in the kitchen had all been washed, and the pantry and larder were full. In fact, everything was more organized than Erin had left it. Lyon had no Skills in cleaning, but she’d kept the inn clean, and found guests. And one of them had just told Erin off because she was treating Lyon like a nuisance.</p>
<p>Erin’s face felt way too hot. She looked at Lyon, and saw the girl glancing away. Embarrassed. They were <em>both</em> embarrassed.</p>
<p>“You’re totally right.”</p>
<p>Erin said that at last. She looked at Zel, and then at Lyonette.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Lyonette. I guess I thought—”</p>
<p>“No, no. It’s my fault. I was horrible before you left. I didn’t—you have every right to think I’d have messed things up.”</p>
<p>The girl interrupted hastily. She seemed so different, almost like another person. Erin had a hard time believing it. She hadn’t believed it before, which is why she hadn’t noticed. But Lyon wasn’t haughty, she wasn’t rude. She was thinner, and she looked tired, but happier than Erin had ever seen her.</p>
<p>And Mrsha was sitting by Lyon, clearly attached to her. Erin took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“I’m still sorry. You did a great job. Mister Zel here is right. I shouldn’t judge. And I’m sorry for leaving. I didn’t want to, but…you did a great job, and I’m glad you kept the inn—and Mrsha safe. Thank you. Thank you so much.”</p>
<p>She trailed off. Lyon looked close to tears and Erin felt a bit emotional herself. She spread her arms.</p>
<p>“Hug?”</p>
<p>Lyonette hesitated, then hugged Erin. The two girls laughed a bit, and Zel turned his head, scratching at one scaled cheek. Across the inn, Erin thought she heard Pisces make a comment, but that was followed by a yelp as Ceria kicked him.</p>
<p>Mrsha ruined the moment by leaping from a table and onto the two girls. She made small sounds as Erin and Lyonette yelped and laughed. The Gnoll seemed wound up by Erin’s return, and she couldn’t stop sniffing at Erin, licking her, and running about.</p>
<p>“Okay Mrsha, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I left you too—how have you been?”</p>
<p>The young Gnoll stared up at Erin. She opened her mouth, paused, and then touched Erin’s leg with one paw. Erin bent down, and the Gnoll nuzzled her face. She was no dog, and there was something deep in her eyes that told Erin she understood.</p>
<p>“Sorry.”</p>
<p>Erin cuddled Mrsha, and then stood up. Zel was watching her.</p>
<p>“Thanks for saying that.”</p>
<p>He smiled, showing a few teeth.</p>
<p>“If you kicked me out for saying that, I wouldn’t be surprised. It wasn’t my place, but I had to say something.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s—”</p>
<p>Erin cleared her throat, embarrassed. She had to get the conversation away from this. She looked back and saw Ksmvr helping Yvlon carry the door in. Lyonette and Zel turned to stare as the door came through the doorway.</p>
<p>“Is that…a door?”</p>
<p>Erin laughed. She smiled at Lyonette and Zel.</p>
<p>“I’ve got some crazy stuff to show you all. Come on, Lyon. We can help everyone get the stuff off the wagon—there’s not much—and you can tell me all about what happened while you were away.”</p>
<p>“And the door?”</p>
<p>“It’s so cool!”</p>
<p>Lyonette caught Zel’s eye as Erin eagerly went over to the door and the adventurers. He was staring at the door and giving her a quizzical look. She shrugged, helplessly. That was Erin. But Lyonette had to smile too. She felt that same sense of strangeness around the other girl. Strangeness, yes, but also excitement, adventure, new thoughts and energy. If she had just one word for it, it would be—</p>
<p>Change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was by coincidence that the Halfseekers met Griffon Hunt on the way back towards the inn. It wasn’t dinner time yet, but the Halfseekers were done with their efforts surrounding the dungeon today. Griffon Hunt on the other hand had returned early, due to Halrac hearing the news about Erin.</p>
<p>The two groups of adventurers nodded to each other when they met, but they were hardly inclined to strike up a conversation. They were allies for the purposes of taking the dungeon on and associates in the same line of work, but still strangers for the most part.</p>
<p>“I hear there’s a new innkeeper. Or rather, the old one’s come back.”</p>
<p>“So it seems.”</p>
<p>Revi nodded somewhat coldly to Jelaqua. The Selphid smiled and the Stitch-girl turned to Halrac.</p>
<p>“Is she really <em>that </em>important? Why are we returning now? Don’t tell me you like this Erin Solstice.”</p>
<p>Halrac looked irritable.</p>
<p>“No. I just want to see.”</p>
<p>“Fine, so long as we don’t have to pay more.”</p>
<p>Revi threw up her hands and walked back to talk with Typhenous and Ulrien. Jelaqua turned to the two members of her group.</p>
<p>“Hm. This Erin Solstice. Do we know her?”</p>
<p>“She’s the one who had that skeleton, remember? The one who punched that Gnoll warrior?”</p>
<p>Moore smiled a bit, and Jelaqua’s eyes widened in recollection.</p>
<p>“The one with the skeleton, right? Well, if she’ll tolerate us I’m fine with the undead wandering around. I really hope she doesn’t kick us out.”</p>
<p>“<strong>Hm. You did make her faint by opening your chest up, Jelaqua.</strong>”</p>
<p>“Damn. Was that her? Sorry, Moore, but you might not be able to get as comfy here as you hoped.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure she won’t be so prejudiced. Have faith.”</p>
<p>The adventurers reached the top of the hill, the Halfseekers arguing about what might change, Revi complaining and Ulrien and Typhenous listening. Halrac ignored the discussion and paused in front of the door. He pushed it open, and blinked.</p>
<p>“Hey there! <em>Halrac!</em>”</p>
<p>A young woman turned in the middle of the room, and a trio of struggling adventurers stopped wrestling with the thick wooden door to turn and look at the newcomers. Erin half-ran across the room and beamed at Halrac.</p>
<p>“<em>You’re</em> staying at my inn? Lyonette, you didn’t say Halrac was the one staying here!”</p>
<p>“You said you wanted it to be a surprise!”</p>
<p>Lyonette hurried over, smiling at Halrac and the other adventurers. They paused.</p>
<p>“Miss Solstice? We haven’t formally met. My name is Ulrien. I lead the team of Griffon Hunt.”</p>
<p>“Oh! Pleased to meet you!”</p>
<p>Erin started shaking hands. Revi came forwards, and Typhenous. Halrac grunted.</p>
<p>“My team. We’re staying at your inn.”</p>
<p>“I know, and that’s great. Come on in—sorry, I was in the doorway, wasn’t I? Come on in! There’s no food yet, but…oh! Are you the other Gold-rank team?”</p>
<p>Somewhat apprehensively, the Halfseekers stepped forwards. Erin was busy staring at Moore and Seborn, both of whom were used to the scrutiny, but the real test was Jelaqua. Erin smiled at the woman and then blinked and frowned as she saw the other woman’s deathly pale face.</p>
<p>“Hi, I’m Erin. Haven’t we met?”</p>
<p>“I believe so. My name is Jelaqua Ivirith. I lead the Halfseekers, who you see before you.”</p>
<p>Erin’s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“Wait a second…you’re that chest-bursting lady! The Selfad, right?”</p>
<p>Jelaqua nodded, not bothering to hold her breath because she didn’t need to breathe that much unless she was talking. But she was nervous, until Erin stuck her hand out, beaming.</p>
<p>“Good to meet you!”</p>
<p>Bemusedly, Jelaqua blinked at Erin’s proffered hand. She hesitated; touching a dead body’s hand was not fun for any species. But there was no way to say that in a moment, so she gingerly shook Erin’s hand. The girl shivered, but not in disgust.</p>
<p>“Whoa. That’s cold. Oh wait, your body is dead, right? That’s so…well, weird, but I guess Humans are weird too, right? Sorry, am I being rude? Wait, was what I said racist? Sorry!”</p>
<p>She smiled at Jelaqua, and then turned to Seborn and Moore.</p>
<p>“And you’re a half-Giant? And a…Drowned Man? Are there Drowned Women, too? Come on in! Lyonette says she makes a ton of food for you, Mister Moore. I’ll see if I can buy bigger plates. And bigger knives and forks, too! Oh, and do you need a bigger bed? I can probably get one made…”</p>
<p>The Halfseekers blinked as Erin talked them into the inn, showing not a hint of fear, suspicion, or even awkwardness around them. She just seemed curious and excited by the adventurers.</p>
<p>“Oh! And here’s my friends. That’s Ceria, Pisces, over there is Yvlon, and that’s Ksmvr…they’re the Horns of Hammerad, an adventuring team like the rest of you!”</p>
<p>Both Gold-rank teams turned to look at the others. The Horns of Hammerad froze, suddenly thrust into the spotlight as they fussed with the wooden door. Ceria turned red as she realized Erin was putting them on the same rank as Gold-rank adventurers, and Yvlon looked like she wanted to swallow her tongue. Only Pisces and Ksmvr seemed at ease—Pisces staring back at the other adventurers appraisingly, and Ksmvr nodding politely.</p>
<p>“You’re an adventuring team now? And you’ve reformed your old party, is that it?”</p>
<p>Jelaqua went over to Ceria, smiling as she greeted the half-Elf. Ceria nodded somewhat warily.</p>
<p>“That’s right. We’re a Silver-rank team. We uh, escorted Erin back to Liscor.”</p>
<p>“From where?”</p>
<p>Halrac frowned at Erin. It was Pisces who answered.</p>
<p>“Celum.”</p>
<p>“How’d you get all the way there?”</p>
<p>Erin debated telling Halrac, but decided to wait until she had more time.</p>
<p>“It’s a long story. But I’m back, and so…these are my friends. They’re going to be staying here.”</p>
<p>“Where? All the rooms are full.”</p>
<p>Revi pointed that out, glancing idly at the other adventurers. She didn’t say anything else, but the implication was clear. The rooms were full, and she wasn’t sharing with anyone. In terms of pecking order, she and the other Gold-rank adventurers far outranked a new team of Silver-rank adventurers.</p>
<p>Erin frowned, vexed. Already problems were popping up! She knew Lyonette had done well to get the other adventurers to stay here, but where were her friends supposed to sleep?</p>
<p>“I guess you guys can sleep in the common room, maybe. I mean, it’s not very private…”</p>
<p>Pisces looked very unhappy at the idea, and Ceria and Yvlon nodded slowly. Lyonette bit her tongue, then spoke up.</p>
<p>“What about the basement?”</p>
<p>“Basement?”</p>
<p>The young woman nodded, blushing as Erin stared blankly at her.</p>
<p>“You do have one.”</p>
<p>“I have a basement?”</p>
<p>Erin thought about this. She vaguely remembered…hadn’t the Antinium built it? She followed Lyon over to the room and blinked as the girl pulled up the trap door. Erin walked down the steps and shouted in surprise.</p>
<p>“I have a basement!”</p>
<p>She came back upstairs, shaking her head in wonder.</p>
<p>“The things you learn…hey Ceria, do you think you guys could sleep in a basement?”</p>
<p>Ceria glanced at the others and nodded.</p>
<p>“Probably.”</p>
<p>“What? It will be cold down there! And what about privacy? I object!”</p>
<p>Pisces complained as he stomped over to stare at the basement in disgust.</p>
<p>“No problem. We can totally make this work. All I need are some blankets, a mattress, curtains—I bet we could even buy some bed stands in Liscor!”</p>
<p>“Or we could sleep in the Frenzied Hare. Isn’t that a far simpler solution?”</p>
<p>Pisces sniffed as all eyes turned to him. He gestured at the door.</p>
<p>“The Frenzied Hare—or a more reputable inn, perhaps? It would be far more effective than sharing elbow room down there.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid you won’t find many rooms, even if you do know the owner of this inn.”</p>
<p>Typhenous called out to the others. He gestured towards the city through one of the windows.</p>
<p>“There’s far too many people here. Every building, loft, and apartment in the city is getting more crowded by the minute.”</p>
<p>Erin laughed, making the old mage frown.</p>
<p>“The Frenzied Hare isn’t here! It’s in Celum!”</p>
<p>Everyone stared at her. Revi spoke slowly.</p>
<p>“Are you planning on heading north right away, then? Because if you’re going a hundred miles to sleep at a different inn…”</p>
<p>The other adventurers chuckled, but Erin’s eyes just sparkled. She turned to the Horns of Hammerad.</p>
<p>“We’ve gotta show them. Come on Pisces, is the door ready?”</p>
<p>He sniffed.</p>
<p>“The door hasn’t stopped being ready. It’s merely placement I was concerned with—”</p>
<p>Erin brushed past him and ran over to the door, which had been leaned against one wall. She beckoned Lyonette, Mrsha, and Zel over. The Drake stopped playing ‘catch the claw’ with Mrsha and walked over to stare at the door.</p>
<p>“What is it, Erin?”</p>
<p>The adventurers sitting or standing at the room stared in bemusement at the plain wooden door—all that is, except for Typhenous and Moore. Revi was openly yawning until Typhenous nudged her and pointed. Then she sat up straight in her chair.</p>
<p>The rest of the Gold-rank teams picked up on the cue, and stared harder at the door. Erin stood in front of it like a circus conductor about to unveil the biggest trick of the night.</p>
<p>“Alright, brace yourselves, everyone. A little bit ago, Ceria, Pisces, Yvlon, Ksmvr—they’re the Horns of Hammerad—they went into Albez with this map thing. And they found this. Well, they didn’t find this, but—”</p>
<p>Erin broke off as she realized she was losing her audience. She shook her head.</p>
<p>“Never mind. But they got this magical door. Look what it can do!”</p>
<p>She flung the door open, and spread her arms wide.</p>
<p>“It’s a portal door!”</p>
<p>There was no wall, behind the door. There should have been, but instead the amazed room of people stared straight into a second room, one filled with racks full of glowing potion bottles, workbenches with powdered ingredients and empty glass containers—</p>
<p>And sitting at one table, humming a song under her breath and putting a label on one bottle, a young woman with dark skin. She looked up, frowning at the sound of the door hitting the wall in Erin’s inn.</p>
<p>Octavia froze, potion bottle in hand as she saw the room full of people all staring at her. She stared at the beaming Erin, at the open-mouthed Jelaqua, at Moore, blinking down at her, and then yelped as a white shape bounded towards her.</p>
<p>“Mrsha, no!”</p>
<p>Lyonette grabbed for the Gnoll. She caught Mrsha a second before the young Gnoll could cause havoc in Octavia’s shop. The Stitch-girl slid off her seat.</p>
<p>“What in the name of exploding cauliflower is this, Erin?”</p>
<p>“Octavia! I’m back in my inn!”</p>
<p>The room—both rooms—erupted into sound as everyone began talking.</p>
<p>“Extraordinary! I can’t believe it!”</p>
<p>“A magical door?”</p>
<p>“In <em>Celum?</em>”</p>
<p>Everyone started clustering around the door. Erin stepped through and beamed at the others as Pisces tried to explain.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it so cool? I can go all the way to Celum just like that! And if I step back—”</p>
<p>She walked back through and spread her arms.</p>
<p>“I’m in Liscor!”</p>
<p>She hopped through again. Ceria frowned and opened her mouth.</p>
<p>“Hey Erin, that’s not the best—”</p>
<p>“In Celum! In Liscor!”</p>
<p>Erin jumped back and forth in rapid succession. Pisces turned and snapped.</p>
<p>“Don’t do that! You’ll exhaust the mana supply!”</p>
<p>“What? Oh—”</p>
<p>Erin half-turned to look back as Pisces as she jumped through the door again—</p>
<p>And the portal closed. One second the other room was there, full of noise, people—Erin could even smell them from Octavia’s shop—and then she was staring at a blank wall. Erin paused and then slowly poked the stone behind the door. Hopefully, she closed the door and opened it again.</p>
<p>Nothing happened. Sitting at her counter, Octavia smacked her forehead and groaned.</p>
<p>“You <em>idiot.</em>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the minutes after the door’s mana supply ran off, there was a lot of shouting. But adventurers being used to sudden changes, no one panicked too much. Except for Mrsha. Lyonette had to lift the howling Gnoll away from the door, and reassure her all was well.</p>
<p>Zel sat with her at a table as Lyonette coaxed Mrsha into sitting with her. The other adventurers were still standing around the door, although now an effort was going on to bring Erin back.</p>
<p>“Erin’s just gone for a little bit, okay Mrsha? It’s all okay. It was just an accident—no one’s hurt!”</p>
<p>“That was startling, though.”</p>
<p>Zel remarked as he stared back at the door. He eyed it, and the adventurers who were beginning to split off, leaving only the five mages to talk about what should be done. Lyonette thought his eyes lingered for a long time on Ksmvr.</p>
<p>“It’s a magical door. It must be incredibly powerful if it can teleport someone so far.”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s an artifact worth—I can’t imagine. But it clearly has its limits, as your boss seems to have discovered.”</p>
<p>He did not look impressed. Zel turned to Lyonette.</p>
<p>“She has a very scattered personality.”</p>
<p>“It was an accident. She was—um.”</p>
<p>Lyonette stared at the door as the mages began to argue loudly. She saw Pisces standing protectively over the door as he and Typhenous began raising their voices.</p>
<p>“And what, pray tell, do you have to object to in the way I altered the enchantment? You will note I barely altered the matrix—”</p>
<p>“By creating a portal? That’s the element of the trap, don’t you see?”</p>
<p>Typhenous looked irritable as he poked the door with one finger, glaring at Pisces.</p>
<p>“It was clearly meant to open and reveal another room—thereby teleporting the incautious to another place entirely. But such a spell isn’t meant to safeguard the user! If it had closed on that young woman’s hand or leg she might have lost it entirely!”</p>
<p>Pisces turned red and Ceria interjected quickly.</p>
<p>“It was a mistake, but the key now is fixing it. If we work together we can probably—”</p>
<p>“We? Let Typhenous fix it. He’s the highest-level out of all of us.”</p>
<p>Revi interrupted, folding her arms. Lyonette winced as Mrsha turned to look. She knew conflict when she saw it, and this was the kind of battle she was used to back home. Not physical, but social, a battle of willpower and hierarchy.</p>
<p>“Oh, is that so? And I take it you are an expert in enchanting magic?”</p>
<p>Pisces drew himself up as Ceria let out a hiss of exasperation. Typhenous stared back archly.</p>
<p>“Not a master, but I am well-versed in it from years of practice and time spent in dungeons. I was educated in the college of magic in the capital city of Pheron for twelve years. And you are…?”</p>
<p>“Pisces. I, and Ceria here, are graduates of Wistram.”</p>
<p>Revi and Typhenous blinked. Revi looked frankly incredulous—Typhenous muttered what looked like a spell under his breath.</p>
<p>“You two?”</p>
<p>“Correct.”</p>
<p>Pisces stared unflinchingly back while Ceria mumbled something in agreement. Typhenous nodded slightly to Revi, and her demeanor changed.</p>
<p>“Well…we might not be Wistram mages, but I was tutored by an expert. We’ve got the experience here—we’ll alter the enchantment on the door before we draw the girl back.”</p>
<p>Pisces’ eyes flashed.</p>
<p>“I am <em>fully </em>capable of doing any needed configuration myself. Your assistance would be useful—”</p>
<p>“It needn’t be a competition.”</p>
<p>The deep voice came from Moore, making all the other mages pause. He had been quiet, but now he looked disapprovingly around at the other four mages.</p>
<p>“We are all experts in some way, aren’t we? I have never been to Wistram, although I have dreamed about studying there. But since none of us specialize in enchantments, let us pool our knowledge.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a question of pooling, Moore.”</p>
<p>Typhenous looked unhappy as he glared at Pisces.</p>
<p>“As I was saying, the enchantments need reworking. If you look at how much magical energy this door drained from just a few moments of being active—”</p>
<p>“My spells did nothing to inhibit the costs! Ceria, back me up here.”</p>
<p>“Let’s all calm down and—”</p>
<p>Across the room, Ulrien and Halrac sat together with Jelaqua and Seborn. They were used to mages, and as such, gave them room. Jelaqua stared at Ceria and Pisces, looking thoughtful.</p>
<p>“Wistram mages?”</p>
<p>Seborn nodded.</p>
<p>“<strong>It seems as though they are. Typhenous was surprised. I wonder why?</strong>”</p>
<p>Ulrien spoke quietly.</p>
<p>“Probably because he didn’t believe it. I’ve heard Wistram mages are a cut above most other mages, even at lower levels.”</p>
<p>“Well, we knew Springwalker was good. Her team might be important to watch. More importantly, where the hells did they find that door? I heard them mention Albez, but I heard that ruin was tapped out decades ago!”</p>
<p>“<strong>Why not ask?</strong>”</p>
<p>Lyonette saw the Gold-rank adventurers get up and begin talking with Yvlon, who looked overwhelmed to be speaking with so many higher-ranking adventurers. She turned to Zel.</p>
<p>“It looks like there’s a lot of competition.”</p>
<p>The Drake nodded.</p>
<p>“Adventurers work together, but they also compete for the same things. These groups seem pretty mellow, actually. I’ve seen things get ugly fast, although it might come to that if the mages don’t cooperate.”</p>
<p>“I’ll do something about that.”</p>
<p>Determinedly, Lyon stood up, letting Mrsha hop off her lap. Erin might be back, but Lyon could still be useful. The Gnoll followed her into the kitchen and in a few moments, came out chewing something in her mouth.</p>
<p>Lyon came out a few moments after that, holding a platter with cut cheese, some sliced bread, and sausage all sliced up. She approached the angry mages, holding the smorgasbord out in case someone cast a spell. They ignored her until she raised her voice tentatively.</p>
<p>“Excuse me. Would anyone like something to eat? Or drink?”</p>
<p>The bickering mages looked up. Like magic—a different kind of magic than was being argued over here—they stopped fighting as all fives mages eagerly grabbed the snacks off of the plate. Moore, who hadn’t really been that confrontational to begin with, smiled gratefully as Lyonette handed him a block of cheese she’d sliced into two parts and half a sausage on a plate of his own.</p>
<p>“Hm. Oh, thank you, my dear.”</p>
<p>Typhenous smiled at Lyonette, and Ceria and Pisces remembered they hadn’t eaten since breakfast as they shoved food into their mouths. Lyonette hurried back into the kitchen, and in a few minutes everyone was sipping from mugs and speaking far more calmly to each other.</p>
<p>“Yes, I see. I suppose we can simply concentrate our mana together to reactivate the doorway until a better solution can be found.”</p>
<p>Typhenous brushed some crumbs off his beard and nodded at Pisces. The young man inclined his head as well.</p>
<p>“How would you like to focus it? Neither Ceria or I have a focusing agent—”</p>
<p>“My staff would work well. Allow me.”</p>
<p>Moore gently raised his staff and touched the door as he put his plate on one table. Typhenous nodded. He reached out and grasped Moore’s other hand. Revi stood by Typhenous’ side; she linked hands with him.</p>
<p>“A good old fashioned link-up, is it? I haven’t done one of these in ages. Do they do these in Wistram?”</p>
<p>“Not much. They have fancy crystals that let mages link up at a distance. I once saw a mage eating in the banquet hall while he helped power a spell two floors up.”</p>
<p>Revi snorted as Pisces took her hand. Ceria offered her skeletal hand to Pisces, he took it, giving her a bemused look. She shrugged.</p>
<p>“Better conductivity.”</p>
<p>“Just so long as you don’t expect the rest of us to do a blood link.”</p>
<p>“Hah!”</p>
<p>The other adventurers, Lyon, Zel, and Mrsha all watched as the mages grew silent. Lyonette had to pick up Mrsha to keep her from wandering over; she had a feeling serious magic was being done.</p>
<p>If it was though, it only took moments and, disappointingly, had no colorful effects or sounds to accompany it. The mages let go and Moore carefully pulled the door open.</p>
<p>“I’m telling you, you’re not going to get it open even if you pour a thousand mana potions on it. Put that down!”</p>
<p>“How do you know? It <em>might</em> work. Let me try one!”</p>
<p>Octavia’s shop appeared in the doorway again, as if nothing had happened. Erin and Octavia were caught in the center of the shop, fighting over a green bottle. They paused and turned to the door.</p>
<p>“Oh hey, the door works.”</p>
<p>“You did it!”</p>
<p>Erin leapt through the door and beamed at the mages. They stepped back, looking slightly weary.</p>
<p>Revi flicked a bit of sweat off her forehead.</p>
<p>“That thing’s a mana sponge. No wonder it can’t run for more than a minute at best.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, guys!”</p>
<p>Erin beamed at the others, and then pointed at the door.</p>
<p>“Will this thing last for a while?”</p>
<p>“Longer than last time, if you don’t exhaust it by moving back and forth again.”</p>
<p>Pisces sat back into a chair and reached for another piece of cheese. Typhenous nodded.</p>
<p>“You have a wonderfully powerful artifact here, Miss Solstice. I would love to talk to you about it—and with you adventurers, if you have the chance. Perhaps over dinner?”</p>
<p>“Dinner! That’s right!”</p>
<p>Erin turned to the window in horror as she realized how late it was getting. She called out to Lyonette as the girl hurried over.</p>
<p>“Lyon, we’ve got to start making food! Tons of it!”</p>
<p>“I’ve got a bunch of it in the pantries, but there’s more in the basement. Should I…?”</p>
<p>“Great! Bring up whatever you need—I’ll start cooking! I’ve got [Advanced Cooking]!”</p>
<p>That made all the adventurers in the room, and Zel, sit up. Mrsha’s ears perked and the young Gnoll crept towards the kitchen to wait.</p>
<p>“Aw, you’re making food? Close the door before I smell it!”</p>
<p>Octavia groused to Erin as the girl began listing food for the appreciative crowd and accepting suggestions for what she should cook. Erin turned and smiled at Octavia.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you join us?”</p>
<p>“Join you?”</p>
<p>“Why not? Come on, lock up your shop and have a meal! You can talk to these guys while you wait—did you know everyone here’s an adventurer? Well, besides Zel and Mrsha and Lyonette—but these guys are Gold-rank adventurers?”</p>
<p>“<em>Gold-rank adventurers?</em>”</p>
<p>Octavia didn’t exactly teleport, but she was through the portal door in a flash. She offered a brown bottle filled with liquid that looked like it had tiny glowing fragments swirling around inside of it to Revi.</p>
<p>“Mana potion?”</p>
<p>“What? No, I don’t need—”</p>
<p>Revi tried to decline, but Octavia pushed the bottle into her hands.</p>
<p>“Free of charge. Complimentary. In fact, let me throw a stamina potion in as well. Have you tried my wares? Octavia’s the name. Please consider using my products if you’re ever in the area. I’d be happy to custom-brew anything you happen to need. In fact, I have a new line of defensive potions and items you might be interested in. Are any of you [Rogues]? I have this wonderful Smoke Sack—that’s what I’m calling it—that has incredible potency for the price. Let me just find you a sample…”</p>
<p>She began her sales pitch and Erin laughed as she walked into the kitchen. The night had gotten off to a bumpy start, but now? Now she felt like everything was beginning to be right.</p>
<p>More than right, in fact. Perfect. Lyonette was in the kitchen, already spreading out food on the countertops. She turned to Erin, looking pleading.</p>
<p>“Can I help? Or at least watch? I’ve got the [Basic Cooking] skill now, actually. I’m still no good, but—”</p>
<p>Erin smiled at the other girl and put a hand on her arm. She grinned, and after a moment Lyonette smiled back. In her corner, Mrsha smiled too, and stared at the food as she waited for the right moment to pounce.</p>
<p>Erin grabbed a knife. She had a feeling she’d need to make a ton of food tonight.</p>
<p>“Let’s get cooking.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Klbkch walked up towards the inn on the hill outside the Liscor, ignoring the cold snow that crunched around his uncovered feet. The Antinium didn’t have much use for clothes, but they were aware of their bodies’ inability to regulate extreme temperatures. Thus, Klbkch kept moving and only stopped in front of the door.</p>
<p>He hesitated. It would be good to see Erin again. But there was so much to talk about! What should he say?</p>
<p>Greetings first. Klbkch knocked and then wondered if he should have brought a gift. Wasn’t that customary after a long time?</p>
<p>Too late now. The Antinium waited, heart pounding a bit faster. He had so much that needed to be said, but perhaps it was Ryoka he should talk to? And yet, Erin was vital in so many ways…</p>
<p>After a moment, Klbkch realized no one had come to answer the door. He listened, and realized there was noise coming from inside. A <em>lot </em>of it.</p>
<p>Cautiously, Klbkch opened the door. A wave of sound, heat, and movement nearly overwhelmed his senses.</p>
<p>The inn was <em>packed!</em> Or at least, it was fuller than he had ever seen it. Klbkch walked into the room and saw Lyonette going from table to table with plates, carrying mugs, and Mrsha skulking between table legs, searching for scraps and occasionally stealing some from plates.</p>
<p>The room was filled with people Klbkch knew, and many people he didn’t. Griffon Hunt, the Halfseekers, and the Horns of Hammerad were occupying one section of the room, talking, arguing, laughing loudly. Across from them, a group of Humans and one Drake were eating, laughing and occasionally getting up to make some kind of speech. Klbkch was sure he’d never seen them in Liscor. Why was there a child with them? He was sitting with the female Drake.</p>
<p>And then—there was Selys, Krshia, a dark-skinned young woman he didn’t know and…<em>Pawn?</em> The Antinium looked up and paused when he saw Klbkch. He was sitting with the Gnoll and Drake—and Ksmvr, of all beings. Klbkch knew he shouldn’t have been surprised to see Ksmvr, but he hadn’t expected the two Antinium to be sitting together.</p>
<p>Ksmvr froze when he saw Klbkch, but Klbkch ignored him. He saw Zel Shivertail, making his way over to the table with the adventurers. The Drake froze when he saw Klbkch, and then kept walking, stiffly.</p>
<p>So many people. But where was Erin? Klbkch looked around and then saw her. She was coming out of the kitchen. He made towards her instantly.</p>
<p>“Erin.”</p>
<p>“Klbkch!”</p>
<p>She greeted him the instant she saw him. Erin beamed and hugged Klbkch—he hugged her back, gingerly.</p>
<p>“How have you been? No, wait—it’s good to see you! Do you want something to eat? Let me find you a place to sit!”</p>
<p>“Actually, Erin. I was hoping to converse with you about—”</p>
<p>“Sure, sure! But later, okay? I’ve got to keep serving—”</p>
<p>“Hey Erin!”</p>
<p>Some raised his voice. Klbkch saw a man get to his feet unsteadily. He waved in Erin’s direction.</p>
<p>“You have to give—show us again how to do the chant! The one with the [Witches]! We can’t decide how it should be performed.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that one? Just a second!”</p>
<p>Erin called out and smiled at Klbkch, looking distracted.</p>
<p>“That’s from <em>Macbeth. </em>It’s a play. Oh, wait, you don’t know what a play is. I’ll explain it in a bit—just wait and I’ll get Lyonette to bring you some fried bee!”</p>
<p>She ran off before Klbkch could say another word. Forlornly, the Antinium stood in place, staring around the room.</p>
<p>“Hey, Klb. Over here.”</p>
<p>Someone addressed him by name. Klbkch turned, and saw Relc sitting by himself at a table. The Drake grunted as Klbkch sat down. He had a huge bowl of corned beef in front of him, and three tankards. He drank from the fourth as Klbkch stared at him.</p>
<p>“Noisy, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“It is unusual. I did not expect to see you here.”</p>
<p>“Why? Because I’m a Goblin-hating jerk?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Did Erin react negatively towards your presence?”</p>
<p>“I think she was too busy to get mad.”</p>
<p>The Drake stared moodily at his food.</p>
<p>“She said hi. And she didn’t kick me out. I guess that’s good, right?”</p>
<p>Klbkch nodded. There was so much<em> sound</em> here! He was used to noisy taverns and inns—it was practically their only state of being. But not here. This was different. And he wasn’t sure he liked it.</p>
<p>“Bee? Someone wanted—oh, hello Klbkch!”</p>
<p>Lyonette bustled over, a bee on a plate. She handed it to Klbkch and turned back to the kitchen. The Antinium stared at the bee, and realized he was hungry. As he ate, he spoke to Relc.</p>
<p>“You seem morose. Why? You being allowed to stay here seems to be a positive thing.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess.”</p>
<p>Relc picked at his food. Klbkch crunched one of the bee’s legs in his mandibles, savoring the honey and butter coated onto the insect.</p>
<p>“It’s just…I feel like we’re not her guests, anymore, y’know? I mean, we’re guests here and we pay and get fed—and this is good grub, but we’re not <em>her</em> guests anymore. We’re just guests.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Klbkch looked around the room. He looked at countless faces, all of whom knew Erin by name, and felt a sense of isolation in his chest.</p>
<p>“I feel the same way.”</p>
<p>“See? It’s not just me!”</p>
<p>Relc drained his mug. He waved for Lyonette to bring him another—and had to keep on waving because Lyonette was busy.</p>
<p>“I guess we didn’t know what we had. But remember when Erin was just by herself? We could come in at any time and she’d be sitting with us…”</p>
<p>“It was pleasant.”</p>
<p>Klbkch nodded as he tore pieces off of his bee. Relc smiled.</p>
<p>“Hah. Remember the pasta?”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“And now—well, now I can look over and see old man Zel sitting right there. Zel Shivertail. The Tidebreaker himself. Eating in this inn. It’s crazy.”</p>
<p>Klbkch nodded silently. He knew that Relc knew of his past history. Klbkch was as famous as Zel. More famous. At least among his own kind. But the extent of that fame was diluted among other races. Relc had only known him as Klbkch the Slayer at first. It was not the same.</p>
<p>“And over there—two teams of Gold-rank adventurers. Gold-rank. You barely see them in the best inns in big cities, and there are two staying here. I could take any one of them on by myself, of course—”</p>
<p>“Of course. Understand I merely say this to act as a friend, not because I believe your combat skills are that advanced.”</p>
<p>“—Shut up, Klb. But I mean, look at them.”</p>
<p>Relc lapsed into silence. Then he dug into his bowl with a spoon and munched down some beef. He wiped at his mouth, looking dispirited.</p>
<p>“Reminds me of when I was back in the army. It reminds me…nah, never mind. I just sorta feel like I’m out of shape, y’know?”</p>
<p>Klbkch nodded.</p>
<p>“I understand your sentiments.”</p>
<p>“<em>I</em> don’t. But I feel out of place and very worthless.”</p>
<p>The two looked over as Olesm collapsed into a seat next to them. The smaller Drake looked despondent as his light blue tail curled up around his chair leg. He slumped forwards onto the table, holding a nearly-empty mug in one claw. Olesm stared at the two guardsmen.</p>
<p>“Mind if I sit here?”</p>
<p>“Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“You appear to be sitting already.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>The Drake sighed, long and loud. Relc poked him with a claw.</p>
<p>“What’s eating you?”</p>
<p>“I wanted to talk to Erin, but she’s busy. And there are so many people here—I feel like I’m not important anymore. I mean, to her. Not that I thought I was—I just want to talk to her, okay?”</p>
<p>“Join the club.”</p>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>
<p>The three sat in silence. The food was good, the company was acceptable, but Erin wasn’t here. Or rather, she was close, but too busy.</p>
<p>After a while, Klbkch spoke.</p>
<p>“It is unseemly to sit and be depressed because of Erin’s good fortune. I believe we should mingle and enjoy ourselves. We will be able to converse with her in time.”</p>
<p>“Mingle? And do what?”</p>
<p>Relc looked annoyed. Klbkch stood up.</p>
<p>“Let us find out.”</p>
<p>Relc exchanged glances with Olesm, but then they stood and entered the party. And it was a party.</p>
<p>“Look at this door! <em>Look at this door!</em>”</p>
<p>Five minutes later, Relc was drunk, laughing, and having the time of his life. He was throwing pieces of bread through the door—which had been laid flat on the ground—into Octavia’s shop, trying to land it in Wesle’s mouth. Thus, he was actually tossing the bits of bread <em>down</em> onto the door’s entrance, whereupon they flew out of the doors sideways, aiming for Wesle as he lay on the floor in front of the enchanted door.</p>
<p>The physics involved created a far trickier game than normal, and the others crowded around the door were laughing.</p>
<p>“Stop making a mess in my shop!”</p>
<p>Octavia was shouting at Relc, but he didn’t seem to notice.</p>
<p>“You play so well! Have you been practicing?”</p>
<p>Olesm was dueling Pawn in one corner, and Typhenous, Ulrien and several other people were busy learning the game or playing it as well. Klbkch, standing to one side and eating his sixth bee, saw Erin move over to the game as if attracted by a magnet.</p>
<p>“Hey, I didn’t know you wanted to learn how to play, Lyonette!”</p>
<p>The girl blushed as she carefully placed pieces on the board. Her opponent, Krshia, was thinking hard as she scratched Mrsha by the ears. The Gnoll sat next to her, nibbling on some cheese, her belly round and full.</p>
<p>“Why don’t I teach you all how to play Go sometime? It’d be great!”</p>
<p>Erin was talking to Olesm and Pawn as Klbkch came over. Olesm looked confused.</p>
<p>“Go?”</p>
<p>“It’s a board game! Even more complex than chess! And it’s simple to make—well, sort of simple! I bet we could get a [Carpenter] to fix up a board for us in less than an hour!”</p>
<p>Erin shouted as she tried to explain the game. Olesm and Pawn crowded around Erin, and Klbkch couldn’t help but draw closer to listen too. Erin tried to share the general details of the game, but it was impossible to share everything in the noisy room.</p>
<p>“Later! We can do it later! I know how to play Shogi too…but I can’t remember what all the kanji on the pieces looks like so it’d be weird. But right now—does anyone want to play a game?”</p>
<p>“Me! Oh, me!”</p>
<p>Olesm practically begged Erin for the first game, and Pawn the second. Klbkch found himself playing Erin—but at the same time as she took on Typhenous <em>and </em>Olesm again.</p>
<p>And then—the party kept going. Some people had to sleep earlier, like Mrsha who was carried upstairs by Krshia, and others, like Jasi, left with her younger brother Grev because it was late. But no matter how many people left, Klbkch found that Erin was always talking to someone.</p>
<p>It was true, what Relc had said. Erin was no longer just his friend. Klbkch found that knowledge slightly painful.</p>
<p>He ran into Zel just once. The Drake had avoided him and all the other Antinium, choosing to hang out with the Humans, or other drakes in the room. But they bumped into each other while going to the bar for another drink.</p>
<p>“Zel Shivertail. Please excuse me.”</p>
<p>The Drake [General] stared at Klbkch with open hostility.</p>
<p>“Why do you know a Human [Innkeeper], Slayer?”</p>
<p>“I could ask you the same question. Coincidence, perhaps?”</p>
<p>“She seems like a decent enough Human, as they go. Foolish, young…but we were all young once. At least, I was. What I don’t understand is why she’d ever befriend the Antinium.”</p>
<p>Klbkch shifted. He was armed with his swords of course, but he had no desire to fight here. Especially because he would die in an instant. Well, it wasn’t the death that bothered him, but the time it would take to revive.</p>
<p>“I do not wish to engage in hostilities here.”</p>
<p>“I won’t break the truce. But I don’t have to pretend to like you.”</p>
<p>Zel turned and walked away. Klbkch let him go. After a while, the Revalantor walked out of the inn, leaving some coins behind on a table for Erin. He stood outside on the snowy hilltop and decided to wait.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lyonette had never been busier, and in a way, never been happier than tonight. She was running about, serving tables, acting like a common peasant in short. But this peasant was leveling. And this peasant was liked.</p>
<p>By Drakes. By Gnolls. By the Antinium, even. Some part of Lyon still thought of Drakes as warmongering monsters, and Gnolls as overgrown dogs. But it was a part of her that Lyon knew was stupid. When she had been starving, a Drake, Olesm, had brought her food. And she loved Mrsha.</p>
<p>And she also loved this inn. There was electricity in the air that night, a charged room that kept everyone up long, long into the night. In fact, it was closer to morning when the last people staggered out and the adventurers went upstairs—or down into the basement—to sleep.</p>
<p>Lyonette found herself dozing at one of the tables, trying to pile dishes while her eyelids drooped. Erin yawned as she made her way over.</p>
<p>“You sleep. I sleep. Tomorrow we’ll…”</p>
<p>The sentence never finished. Erin just sort of wandered off.</p>
<p>“Here.”</p>
<p>Someone took the plates away. Lyonette looked up and saw Zel smiling at her.</p>
<p>“You’re awake?”</p>
<p>She said it stupidly. Zel grinned.</p>
<p>“What can I say? I like parties, and I’m used to staying up days without sleep.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Lyonette turned and looked upstairs. It seemed like a long way to go. Zel chuckled.</p>
<p>“Need a tail? Or—claw? What is it you Humans say, a hand?”</p>
<p>“Something like that.”</p>
<p>The girl grinned at Zel as she saw, out of the corner of her eye, Erin wandering into the kitchen. The Drake frowned as he looked in that direction.</p>
<p>“Is she going to sleep there?”</p>
<p>“She used to.”</p>
<p>Sure enough, the two heard a <em>thump</em> and then faint snoring as Erin immediately fell asleep. Zel shook his head and Lyon grinned.</p>
<p>“She’s a good…good…”</p>
<p>“So you say.”</p>
<p>He started helping Lyonette towards the stairs. But she paused as she put her foot on the first step.</p>
<p>“Something’s happening. Something is…weird…”</p>
<p>Zel paused. Then he frowned.</p>
<p>“Yes. I can feel it too.”</p>
<p>He turned. Lyonette shivered, and looked towards the fire. But it was still hot—and she realized she wasn’t shivering in cold, but rather trembling. The room was shaking.</p>
<p>“What…?”</p>
<p>“Earthquake?”</p>
<p>Zel looked around, ushering Lyonette towards a table. She stumbled towards it, but then realized something was wrong.</p>
<p>“No—look!”</p>
<p>She cried out as she pointed towards the walls. Zel turned and swore. The walls were trembling as well, and—<em>glowing. </em></p>
<p>“What in the name of the Ancestors is <em>happening?</em>”</p>
<p>Lyonette held onto a table as she heard voices from above. People were waking back up, and stumbling around. She turned, and tried to run for the stairs.</p>
<p>“<em>Mrsha!</em>”</p>
<p>The light grew stronger. Lyonette cried out in fear, and then, suddenly, everything <em>stopped.</em> It was as if the world had been pushing, shaking as it moved towards something. But now the world had reached its conclusion. The inn returned to normal. The walls grew dark and still.</p>
<p>But it was not the same inn of a moment ago. Lyonette’s legs shook as she steadied herself on the staircase railing for support. She stood up, and stared around the room. Zel stared back.</p>
<p>“What—what happened? I feel…”</p>
<p>Something was different. It was in the air, in the walls, even in the ground. The atmosphere in the inn suddenly felt <em>charged</em> to Lyonette. Zel just stared at her, uncomprehending.</p>
<p>“Why did the shaking stop?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. But can’t you feel that?”</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>“Feel what?”</p>
<p>Lyonette stared at him. He couldn’t feel it, but she could. Untrained as she was, she could feel it in every particle she breathed, every step she took as she walked across the floor of the inn. She raised her hand and concentrated.</p>
<p>“[Light].”</p>
<p>An orb of light drifted upwards from her hand. It glowed deep blue, and then shifted to a murky green; the color of the ocean depths that she had seen only once before. It was just an orb of light—</p>
<p>But it was far larger than it should be. As the ball of light flew upwards, it expanded, turning into a sphere, a tiny green planet of its own. And more orbs of light rose upwards as well, from the ground, the tables, hovering in the air, a constellation of slowly shifting lights.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>Zel stared wide-eyed at the lights. He looked back at Lyonette, but she was pale-faced too. She had never cast a spell like this before. This—was closer to [Illumination], a spell far beyond her. But all she had cast was [Light].</p>
<p>“What is it? How is this happening?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. But I can feel it. It’s…everywhere.”</p>
<p>“What is?”</p>
<p>Lyonette held one of the softly glowing orbs out. It turned pure white, and she breathed the words.</p>
<p>“<em>Magic.</em>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And she woke up, in the moments before the sun rose. Erin sat up as Lyonette and Zel stood in the common room. She stared at the glowing lights floating in her inn, and heard the words, the words that thundered in her mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Innkeeper Level 30!]</p>
<p>[Conditions Met: Innkeeper → Magical Innkeeper Class!]</p>
<p>[Skill – Inn: Magical Grounds obtained!]</p>
<p>[Skill – Inn: Field of Preservation obtained!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Wow.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p>It was still dark, still quiet, when the door of the inn opened. It was not night. But it was not day either. This was the brief moment before dawn, the quietest, most empty time. The sun had not risen, but the sky was no longer quite as black.</p>
<p>The door to the inn slowly opened, and someone came out. They moved very slowly; the rest of the inn was completely asleep at last, an hour after all the magic had occurred. As it turned out, even something as dramatic as an inn becoming a magical inn couldn’t keep people awake that much longer.</p>
<p>But the lone figure was still up. It closed the door and then peered upwards at the side of the inn.</p>
<p>This is what someone would have witnessed if they were waiting outside. A slight scraping sound, the sound of indrawn breath, scuffling. The figure climbed up onto the roof of the inn, muttering as snow cascaded down around them. But in the end, they were on top, and then quiet crunching followed their slow movement across the top of the inn.</p>
<p>A small flurry of snow swirled downwards as a small patch on the rooftop was cleared. After a few more seconds, the figure sighed as she took a seat, letting her legs dangle over the edge of the roof. Only then did she speak.</p>
<p>“Oh, hey Klbkch. I didn’t see you down there.”</p>
<p>Klbkch stepped out of the darkness and away from the wall he’d been standing next to. He nodded up at Erin Solstice.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Erin. I hope I did not alarm you?”</p>
<p>“I was about to scream, or throw something. I nearly had a heart attack. But why are you out here?”</p>
<p>“As a matter of fact, I was hoping to speak with you. But I did not anticipate you coming out here so early in the day. Or rather, late at night.”</p>
<p>The two spoke very quietly, their voices swallowed up almost immediately by the snow and night. But now Erin’s voice was filled with quiet amusement and astonishment.</p>
<p>“What, you were going to wait outside all night? That’s so weird. Why were you waiting? Come on up!”</p>
<p>It took Klbkch only a few moments to leap upwards and pull himself onto the rooftop. He was far more agile than Erin and stronger, too. She moved over and he sat next to her. Erin was still warm from the inside; Klbkch seemed like a cold block of ice.</p>
<p>“Was it something really important? You could have just woken me up.”</p>
<p>“No. That would be discourteous. And my issue was not so pressing…I simply found talking to you last night to be difficult, so I decided to wait outside while I determined what exactly I should say.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Erin fell silent. She turned her head and looked at Klbkch. He sat still, not shivering, more like a statue than a living thing.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I didn’t get to talk. I really am glad to see you. It’s just I had so much to do…”</p>
<p>“I understand. And the fault is mine for expecting complete attention.”</p>
<p>“No it’s not. We’re friends.”</p>
<p>“…It is good that you are well, Erin. Your departure was alarming as it was mysterious.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It was.”</p>
<p>Erin exhaled slowly, letting a small trail of vapor fly upwards. Klbkch watched it dissipate.</p>
<p>“I am told your skeleton was the cause.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. He was.”</p>
<p>“That is regrettable.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Klbkch was used to maintaining both sides of a conversation. He had worked with Relc for years and was used to the Drake’s moodiness. But with Erin, he found it was easiest to wait. Or rather, he wanted to wait and hear what she had to say rather than talk.</p>
<p>“You know, I was surprised by Lyonette. She really changed while I was gone.”</p>
<p>“It was dramatic, certainly. I was not aware of her transformation until this point.”</p>
<p>“She really did do a whole lot. She helped save Mrsha, took care of the inn—she even learned how to steal honey from those evil bees. By herself! And she got me new guests to stay at my inn.”</p>
<p>“The Gold-rank adventurers are certainly a boon.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’m glad they’re my guests. But that Zel Shivertail guy? He’s important too, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>Erin’s face turned to Klbkch. He couldn’t see her exact features in the dim light, but he saw her eyes meet his. He knew what question was coming, or thought he did. If it were anyone else, Klbkch might have hesitated or considered an untruth or partial truth. But with Erin he just nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes. He is a Drake [General]. A famous one.”</p>
<p>She shrugged as if that made no difference. Erin stared out at the walls of Liscor to the west. They were gray, imposing, a darker blob of color amid all the snow.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t like me. He thinks I’m irresponsible, silly, and sort of a jerk. Which is fair. But he hates you, Klbkch. I mean, <em>really</em> hates you.”</p>
<p>Klbkch stirred, looked at Erin.</p>
<p>“You could tell?”</p>
<p>She just smiled a bit.</p>
<p>“It was obvious. I saw him look at you a lot while I was serving food and chatting. The innkeeper sees everything, after all. Just like the butler, the maid, and the kids. It was obvious he didn’t like you—or Ksmvr or Pawn. And you—were the two of you enemies? In the war, I mean?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>The two paused, and then the conversation moved on. Klbkch looked at Erin, but saw very little behind her calm, somewhat tired expression. He didn’t know how she felt and was…afraid…to ask.</p>
<p>“There were many guests in your inn. I take it these were all acquaintances?”</p>
<p>“From Celum, yeah. It was good to see them, although they did get a bit crazy and trash Octavia’s shop. I was happy to see they were all doing well.”</p>
<p>“Indeed?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Jasi’s doing well. So is Grev, which is great. I mean, he’s not stealing anymore and he looks halfway cute now that he’s cleaned up. Even if he has a big nose.”</p>
<p>“I see. Will you tell me who Jasi and Grev are?”</p>
<p>“Oh—right. You don’t know.”</p>
<p>Erin looked sideways at Klbkch. He stared back. She smiled, and the night lit up a bit.</p>
<p>“There’s so much that happened. I mean, I know there’s a lot that happened with you over here—adventurers and dungeons and new Antinium and stuff. But would you like to hear what I did?”</p>
<p>“I believe I would.”</p>
<p>The two sat on the roof and talked for a while. It was the first conversation they’d had that was really between the two of them just catching up. Talking. Briefly, Erin told Klbkch the story of how she’d started putting on plays in Celum. Klbkch listened, nodding a few times and trying to imagine this strange activity Erin was performing.</p>
<p>“Such performances sound quite extraordinary, not to mention profitable. I would like to witness one if the occasion permits. Indeed, the city of Liscor may be receptive to such activities as well.”</p>
<p>“Would your Queen like it, do you think? Would that be one of the things which helps your Hive—putting on a play for her?”</p>
<p>He paused. And then he shook his head.</p>
<p>“I do not believe she would care to view a play. And if she did, I do not think she would understand it.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Klbkch nodded.</p>
<p>“There are many things my people do not understand.”</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“Friendship. Laughter. Happiness. Ambition. Joy. Tears.”</p>
<p>“Really? You don’t understand tears? I mean, I know the Antinium don’t cry, but you don’t understand them?”</p>
<p>“I understand it is an action meant to express sadness. I do not understand why those who weep feel better after having done so.”</p>
<p>“I guess it’s because being sad helps. And crying is very sad.”</p>
<p>“Intriguing.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it? Us Humans are so intriguing. Except that I think Antinium are way more interesting.”</p>
<p>“That is a rare perspective.”</p>
<p>“I know. A lot of people don’t like the Antinium. Well, everyone, really. When I was in Celum I heard terrible things. And I’ve been told you guys are evil by all kinds of people. You know Lady Magnolia?”</p>
<p>“I know her, yes.”</p>
<p>“She doesn’t like you.”</p>
<p>“I am aware.”</p>
<p>Klbkch felt Erin looking at him again.</p>
<p>“Klbkch, will you promise me to tell the truth if I ask you an important question?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>The Antinium closed his mandibles slowly. He gripped the tiles on top of the roof, hard enough to crack one slightly as Erin stared at him. At last, she asked.</p>
<p>“What do the Antinium want? Really want, I mean?”</p>
<p>“To live. We want to live.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>The two sat in silence as the sky grew a bit brighter. Just a bit. Erin shivered and mumbled about bringing a blanket. Klbkch sat in the cold, feeling it chill his entire body.</p>
<p>“If you guys want to live so badly, do you think you could live in peace? Not go to war, I mean? Be…nice to other nations?”</p>
<p>“It is doubtful.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Klbkch shifted in his seat, dislodging more snow.</p>
<p>“Understand I speak of all the Hives, not just my own. I may be unfamiliar with recent events that have transpired, but I understand the way the Queens think. For them, peace is a strange concept. We do not think in terms of peace and war. We simply build up to wars, the next conflict. We have only known war, never peace.”</p>
<p>“So this isn’t peace. You’re really planning on going to war?”</p>
<p>“Some Queens are. Others think we should ally against our true enemy.”</p>
<p>“Who? Wait, what about your Queen? Would she be friends with the Drakes and Gnolls and Humans?”</p>
<p>“I do not believe she knows how.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes. She does not understand friendship any more than I do.”</p>
<p>“But you’re friends with Relc, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“I am his partner. And I have been so for years. I have accompanied him on many occasions, and yes, I consider myself his friend. But I do not understand how I came to be one. And my Queen has no friends.”</p>
<p>He heard Erin take in a slow breath.</p>
<p>“Not even you?”</p>
<p>“Not even me. What we have is different.”</p>
<p>It was more than five minutes before anyone spoke next. Klbkch could see Erin’s eyes and head drooping. She was tired. So was he, but neither moved to get out of the cold. At last, as the sky grew brighter, foreshadowing the dawn, Erin stretched. Then she stood up. She stood on the roof of her inn and stared around the wide, open plains filled with snow. Everything was motionless, as if she was looking at a painting rather than reality.</p>
<p>“The world’s gotten a lot bigger, Klbkch. I know it’s usually the opposite way around, but I feel like every time I think I understand things, it turns out I don’t really get anything at all.”</p>
<p>Erin paused, and stared at the cold, pale snow stretching in every direction around her.</p>
<p>“…Or maybe it’s that I was looking at the wrong things to begin with. Does that make sense?”</p>
<p>Klbkch shook his head.</p>
<p>“Not at all. Your statement was quite incomprehensible to me.”</p>
<p>“Well, good. I don’t think I understand it well myself. What I’m trying to say is—did you know I leveled up last night?”</p>
<p>“I noticed an odd phenomenon around your inn and surmised this was the case, yes.”</p>
<p>“I got to Level 30. I’m a [Magical Innkeeper] now. My inn is also magical, or it has a lot of mana in it.”</p>
<p>“Congratulations. This is a great accomplishment.”</p>
<p>Klbkch inclined his head to her. Erin smiled a bit, and then grew serious.</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s great. But—it’s strange.”</p>
<p>“How so?”</p>
<p>She spread her arms wide, turning to take in her inn and everything around it.</p>
<p>“Just look, Klbkch. I’ve got so much now. A new inn, a magical inn, a helper, friends, guests, a lot of money—even a magical portal door. And that’s great, it really is. But it’s not as important anymore as it used to be. Money’s just…money, now. What’s important is something else.”</p>
<p>“And will you tell me what that is?”</p>
<p>“People. We went past Esthelm on the way here, did you know? It was attacked by Goblins.”</p>
<p>“I am aware. But the city repelled them and retook the walls, did they not?”</p>
<p>“They did. But they’re hungry, Klbkch. Hungry. A lot of people died and they’re afraid the Goblins will come back. They’re going to fight to the death if they do, but this Goblin Lord is hurting everyone.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Over fourteen villages have been destroyed and a Drake city took heavy casualties fighting off a Goblin army to the south.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know about that.”</p>
<p>“It is not a pressing concern. Such occurrences are common during calamitous events.”</p>
<p>Erin frowned at the sitting Antinium.</p>
<p>“No, you don’t get it. I didn’t know, but I wanted to know. I need to know.”</p>
<p>“Why? It does not impact your life here.”</p>
<p>“But people died. People are suffering. What happened to the survivors? Did anyone survive?”</p>
<p>Klbkch paused.</p>
<p>“I did not inquire. Such information would be obtainable I believe. Again though, I must ask why you wish to know.”</p>
<p>“Because I care.”</p>
<p>“You care about Goblins.”</p>
<p>“I care about a lot of people. I’d like to help them, if I can.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Erin stared at the distant mountaintops, where something bright was rising.</p>
<p>“Before I went to Celum, I was really only concerned about surviving. But now—now I care about my friends. I care about people, Klbkch. I care about whether they live or die. I care that Jasi couldn’t find work and that Grev felt he had to steal to survive. I care about Rags and why people hate Goblins. And I care about the people in Esthelm, how they’ll do, and about Krshia and her shop, about Mrsha and Lyonette and you—”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I guess because we’re friends? Or—no. Because they’re people. Because caring is important. Because I think I can help. Look at my inn. I’ve got money, friends…why shouldn’t I help?”</p>
<p>Klbkch stared at the young woman standing on the roof of her inn. He stood up and tried to see from her perspective.</p>
<p>“I do not understand, but I find myself admiring your perspectives. And yet, I must point out that aiding strangers has no benefit.”</p>
<p>“That’s a very Antinium thing of you to say, Klbkch.”</p>
<p>“Thank you?”</p>
<p>“Who cares if it doesn’t help me? If it helps them then I’m doing a good job. And then we might be friends.”</p>
<p>“Friends. How are friends created? How does friendship work? How do you make friends?”</p>
<p>Klbkch stared at Erin, wishing there were an easy answer. Something he could tell his Queen, tell the others, so he could change them. He did not expect a reply. But to his astonishment, Erin Solstice smiled and laughed out loud in pure amusement.</p>
<p>“Friends? That’s easy!”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>She reached out and tapped Klbkch on the chest, right where his heart would be if he were Human. Erin smiled as dawn broke.</p>
<p>“All you have to do is give.”</p>
<p>“Give? Give what, precisely?”</p>
<p>“Something. Anything. Give your time to someone else to talk, give a bit of trust, or a helping hand. Give them a second, and maybe you’ll get something back.”</p>
<p>“But what if you do not?”</p>
<p>“Then you don’t. Maybe you’ll never get anything no matter how much you give. Maybe you’ll never be friends. That’s how it works. But to make a friend, you have to try. Just try.”</p>
<p>The Human and the Antinium stood on the rooftop for a while staring at each other. Klbkch stared at Erin, and then nodded.</p>
<p>“I believe I understand. If that is the case, anyone may be your friend. So then you care about everyone.”</p>
<p>“Because it’s the right thing to do. Because they’re people too. Because I can.”</p>
<p>“I have not heard that perspective before.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Erin turned and looked around. She walked towards the edge of the roof and stared back at Klbkch, perplexed.</p>
<p>“Why wouldn’t you think like that? Where I come from—well, some people think like that. We’re all people, aren’t we? Shouldn’t we help each other?”</p>
<p>“I have heard it said Humans help only Humans. I have seen Drakes help only their relatives. Gnolls help their species, but seldom others. Each race has their enemies, their rivals. The Antinium see nations and politics as a competition for resources.”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t.”</p>
<p>Erin stepped off the roof. She landed on the ground and looked up at Klbkch.</p>
<p>“Come on. I’ll make breakfast, and then you can help me.”</p>
<p>He leapt off the roof and landed next to her.</p>
<p>“Do what, exactly?”</p>
<p>Erin smiled. It was a big smile, open and without guile. It was her smile, and it lit up the world.</p>
<p>“Something awesome.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lyonette woke up as dawn broke. She got out of bed, feeling her muscles aching and exhaustion on every line of her body. Mrsha was sound asleep next to her, snoring gently. Lyonette would have liked nothing better than to go to sleep, but she <em>had</em> to get up now. She had to feed all her guests, get ready for the day.</p>
<p>She trudged downstairs, automatically reciting the list of chores for the day when she heard the <em>pop</em> and sizzle of meat frying. She poked her head into the kitchen and saw Erin, frying and cooking away a storm in her kitchen while Klbkch sat on a stool next to her and peeled potatoes.</p>
<p>“Morning, Lyonette! I’ve got breakfast started and Klbkch got us a lot of water already. Do you want to bring in the rest of the dishes and help me wash them before everyone gets up?”</p>
<p>Lyon blinked at Erin a few times. Then she nodded and got to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it. Can you sense the ambient mana in the air, Pisces?”</p>
<p>“I can and do, Ceria. It is simply astounding—when I consider the ramifications of such a Skill—”</p>
<p>The next morning, the inn was in an uproar. Well, a quiet uproar. Mainly confined to all the mages, really. The other adventurers just stared at their magic-using comrades when they exclaimed over Erin’s new Skill. Ulrien blinked constantly as Typhenous raved about the mana in the air, Halrac ignored Revi, and Yvlon plugged her ears rather than listen to Ceria and Pisces discuss what had happened.</p>
<p>To show solidarity, Ksmvr put two of his hands over his earholes. Jelaqua and Seborn listened to Moore out of politeness, but the Selphid’s eyes kept wandering in different directions.</p>
<p>In the end, the mages congregated at one table where they could properly express their amazement and get back more satisfactory responses.</p>
<p>“So? What’s the verdict? Is my inn cool or is it <em>magical?</em>”</p>
<p>Erin smiled as she brought over a basket of rolls to dip in the honey. Typhenous levitated the soft butter up and sliced some off. He accepted a roll with a smile for Erin.</p>
<p>“My dear, your Skill is nothing short of extraordinary. Why, I consider it quite an achievement to have created for all intents and purposes a magical leyline in your own inn. When I think of the positive applications…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s cool, but I can’t do magic. Does this mean all your spells are super-powerful now?”</p>
<p>Erin propped her hands on her hips as she regarded the mages with amusement. Ceria shrugged.</p>
<p>“It’s not as if they’ll become <em>that</em> much more powerful, but we could cast the same spell almost twice as many times here. And like Lyonette found out, if no one else is using the magic here, it can accumulate and boost a low-level spell to a great degree.”</p>
<p>“That’s super-powerful. Well, I’m glad it helps. I just hope it’ll recharge my door faster.”</p>
<p>“At the very least it will!”</p>
<p>Pisces seemed outraged by Erin’s lack of enthusiasm. He ripped one roll apart and dipped both ends in the honey, glaring at her.</p>
<p>“Do you understand—mph—what this—nmf—could mean? You could use the mana supply here to power any number of enchantments—”</p>
<p>“Ew. Don’t talk when you’re eating. You mean, like the [Field of Preservation] Skill?”</p>
<p>“It certainly seems that way.”</p>
<p>Moore smiled as Erin presented him with a roll that was more like a loaf. She thought about this as the mages’ conversation about what they might use the mana source for devolved into an argument over who would get how many rolls. But their conversation <em>had</em> given Erin an idea.</p>
<p>“Hey, Lyonette! Want to try an experiment?”</p>
<p>She called the young girl over and brought out an apple. It was a small one, and slightly wizened—not to mention expensive! Erin sliced it open and both she and Lyonette stared at the pale slice of apple.</p>
<p>After a while Lyonette coughed.</p>
<p>“Um, shouldn’t we come back later?”</p>
<p>“Right…”</p>
<p>Erin slapped her head and left the apple. She bent down to catch Mrsha before the Gnoll could leap onto the table and grab the apple for herself.</p>
<p>“Hey there Mrsha, how are you doing on this fine day? Do you think my new Skills are cool?”</p>
<p>Mrsha licked at Erin’s face frantically, making the young woman laugh and let go.</p>
<p>“Hey! Stop that!”</p>
<p>“Mrsha, don’t bother Erin! You can play after breakfast.”</p>
<p>Lyonette pulled Mrsha back. As she put the reluctant Gnoll on the ground, she saw Erin giving her an appraising look, far different from yesterday.</p>
<p>“You’re pretty good at handling Mrsha, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Well…I suppose I have had practice.”</p>
<p>“Good! Actually, that’s great.”</p>
<p>Erin smiled at Lyonette, and the girl flushed with pride. Erin turned and frowned around her busy inn.</p>
<p>“Last night you told me you stole something else from those evil bees, right? Honey, dead bees, and…uh, what was it? A larva? Where is it?”</p>
<p>“Oh! I put it in my room so it wouldn’t bother anyone. I can go get it—”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you show me?”</p>
<p>The two Humans went up the stairs, Mrsha right on their heels. Erin peered at the fat, yellowish-white grub sitting in the bowl of slightly congealed liquid and shuddered.</p>
<p>“Aw. It’s so…gross.”</p>
<p>Lyonette giggled.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it? I was going to feed it to Klbkch, but then I got a [Beast Tamer] class! Um…”</p>
<p>“You want to keep it?”</p>
<p>Erin gave her the fish eye. Lyonette nodded.</p>
<p>“It grows on you. And it’s not hard to feed—I keep adding more royal jelly to the bowl. Actually, I’ll need a bigger bowl; it keeps getting bigger.”</p>
<p>Erin studied the slowly wriggling grub. She frowned at it pensively.</p>
<p>“Have you named it?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You’ve gotta give it a name. How about Pudge?”</p>
<p>“Pudge?”</p>
<p>“Well, it sort of looks like Pudge, don’t you think? No? Okay, what about a bee name? It’s going to turn into a bee someday, so how about…Buzz?”</p>
<p>Lyonette frowned at Erin.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Those names sound a bit…”</p>
<p>“Wait, I’ve got it! <em>Bee</em>yonce. That’s perfect! No—wait, that’s horrible. Let me try again…”</p>
<p>“It’s just a grub. You don’t <em>have </em>to name it yet.”</p>
<p>“Apis? That’s the word for bee in uh, Latin. I think. Buzzana? Buzzany? Is it a boy or a girl bee?”</p>
<p>Lyonette just stared. Erin tried out several more names, and then realized she was getting a funny look from Mrsha as well. She threw up her hands and walked away.</p>
<p>“Fine! You can name the bee whatever you want when it gets big. But for now I’m calling him Mr. Ugly Fat Worm. It is a him, right?”</p>
<p>Lyonette and Mrsha exchanged a glance. The Gnoll reached out to poke the big larva and Lyonette smacked her paw away.</p>
<p>“What <em>are</em> you planning on doing now that you’re a Level 30 [Innkeeper]?”</p>
<p>Jelaqua asked as Erin went around the room with a pitcher, refilling cups. Erin paused and then shrugged.</p>
<p>“I’ve got some ideas. I mean, I’m not going to expand or anything; this is plenty for me as it is. But I might do more with what I have.”</p>
<p>The Selphid raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Oh? Such as?”</p>
<p>“You’ll see. In fact, you’ll see in five minutes if you wait. I might need your group’s help for something I have in mind.”</p>
<p>“Really now. In that case, I think I’ll have a refill.”</p>
<p>Jelaqua smiled and leaned back in her chair as Erin filled her cup and moved on. Seborn leaned over to her.</p>
<p>“<strong>What do you think she has in mind that involves <em>us?</em></strong>”</p>
<p>“No idea, but I’m curious, aren’t you? I heard stories all over Liscor about the crazy innkeeper, but we missed all the action. I want to be up close and personal for this one.”</p>
<p>One table over, Zel turned his head to frown at Erin’s back. He wasn’t so positive as the Selphid, and his premonition only got worse when Erin marched back over to the table full of mages.</p>
<p>“Hey, can I ask you guys to do an estimate for me?”</p>
<p>“Of course. About what?”</p>
<p>Ceria frowned as Erin pointed to the door.</p>
<p>“Now that I’ve got mana coming out of the walls and stuff, how much do you think I’d be able to transport through the door? I mean, in pounds? Or is it kilograms?”</p>
<p>The mages glanced around the table and began to speak. Pisces was the first person to come up with a response that wasn’t immediately shot down.</p>
<p>“I would wager the door could transport, oh, sixteen to thirty bodies between Celum and Liscor on a daily basis. I say sixteen as a lower estimate given the increased costs based on weight and mass, you see. If you had a group of armed warriors, sixteen would indeed be…”</p>
<p>“Okay, that’s not bad. But what if you all added your mana to it? How many then?”</p>
<p>Pisces broke off, looking confused. Revi exchanged glances with Typhenous.</p>
<p>“Well, we could add a lot. If you mean like last night, to bring a lot of people through—”</p>
<p>“No, I mean as much as you can. What if you drank mana potions, and put in <em>everything</em> you had into the door? How many people could you transport then?”</p>
<p>Ceria frowned.</p>
<p>“At least a hundred. But why? Erin, you aren’t planning on actually turning your door into a big shortcut between the cities, are you? Because mana potions aren’t cheap, and neither are mages. We could do it once or twice, but adding our mana to the door isn’t <em>that</em> easy.”</p>
<p>“No problem. You’d only have to do it once. And I guess one hundred people is good, but not enough. What if you went and got more mages?”</p>
<p>“<em>What?</em>”</p>
<p>Erin leaned forwards and put her hands on the table as she stared at the astonished mages. The other Gold-rank teams had stopped eating and were listening closely. Klbkch, sitting alone at his table, raised his head and waited, uncertain of what was coming next, but certain that it would be ‘awesome’.</p>
<p>“Mister Typhenous and Miss Revi—can I call you guys Typhenous and Revi? You’re big shot adventurers, right? And so are you, right Moore?”</p>
<p>“I’d say so.”</p>
<p>“By some standards, yes.”</p>
<p>“Among local adventurers, we are somewhat well known.”</p>
<p>Erin turned to look at Pisces and Ceria.</p>
<p>“And you two guys are Wistram mages, right? That’s important too, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>The two Silver-rank adventures fidgeted. Ceria coughed, blushing slightly.</p>
<p>“Not as important as Gold-rank, Erin—”</p>
<p>“That’s fine. But if I asked you to, could you get all of the mages in Celum and Liscor to come here and charge the door?”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Everyone looked astounded, but Erin just grinned.</p>
<p>“I want to bring in supplies. And people! Adventurers, [Guardsmen], [Guardswomen] too—I know there are some in Celum, food, clothing, blankets, pillows…I want as much of it as this door can teleport, today.”</p>
<p>“Why? What is this all for? And where would you put it?”</p>
<p>Revi looked exasperated as she asked. Pisces’ mouth formed an ‘o’ of comprehension as Erin smiled at the Stitch-mage.</p>
<p>“Esthelm.”</p>
<p>The room fell silent. Halrac blinked, and Ulrien sat up at the same time Jelaqua nudged Seborn with an elbow. The Selphid’s whisper was quite audible.</p>
<p>“See? What did I tell you? Isn’t she <em>great?</em>”</p>
<p>“You want to send aid to Esthelm?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>Erin turned and met Zel’s eyes confidently. Revi frowned.</p>
<p>“No offense Erin, but why would you want to do that? Esthelm isn’t your home, is it? Why would you waste your coin and energy helping them out? I heard they already had control of the city, anyways.”</p>
<p>“But they need food. I went through there the other day—they might be in control, but their walls aren’t great, and they need blankets, supplies—more people. If Celum and the other cities are too afraid to send help down the roads, why not come up from Liscor instead?”</p>
<p>“There’s still danger on the roads, though. The area around Liscor isn’t safe from Goblin attacks.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but what if we sent a huge Antinium army and a bunch of Gold-rank adventurers with all the wagons to protect them?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Halrac and Jelaqua said it at the same time as Zel. At opposite ends of the room, Ksmvr and Klbkch sat up.</p>
<p>“My Queen would never allow—”</p>
<p>“Erin, I do not believe I could persuade my Queen to—”</p>
<p>Both Antinium broke off. Ksmvr shrank down in his seat while Klbkch stared, until the Antinium looked away. Erin stared around the room, frowning slightly.</p>
<p>“Well, why not?”</p>
<p>“Erin, you can’t just ask an <em>Antinium</em> army to go marching—and you want Celum to just hand over all the goods? Your idea is…I mean it’s crazy…”</p>
<p>Ceria shook her head, frowning. But to her surprise, Yvlon stood up.</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>Everyone looked at her. Yvlon looked at Erin.</p>
<p>“I think it could work.”</p>
<p>Revi raised her eyebrows incredulously.</p>
<p>“You do? Because I think it’s crazy too, like Miss Half-Elf said.”</p>
<p>“I think it can be done. Celum has the supplies and manpower to send—it’s just a matter of convincing their leaders to act. And if Ksmvr and Klbkch talk to their Queen—”</p>
<p>“Um. I am technically banned from entering my Hive—”</p>
<p>“And I do not know if I can convince my Queen.”</p>
<p>Erin stared at Klbkch. He was giving her an odd look. She walked over to him.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>He stared into her eyes. Klbkch’s face was inexpressive, but Erin could tell by the way his mandibles opened and shut repeatedly that he was troubled.</p>
<p>“I…could try. But I do not have high hopes of convincing my Queen.”</p>
<p>“And are we just going to ignore the part where you get an army of wagon drivers to take everything to Esthelm? Where are you going to get that? And are you going to pay for all of this, or do you expect Celum to foot the bill? I don’t think Liscor would pay to help Humans.”</p>
<p>Revi kept talking, determined to point out the obvious. She indicated Typhenous, Ulrien, and Halrac with one hand.</p>
<p>“And what’s this about volunteering us to guard the wagons? We might be guests here, Erin, but we don’t work for free.”</p>
<p>“I’ll let you stay for free if you help. And I can pay.”</p>
<p>Erin turned back to Revi, putting her hands on her hips. She stared challengingly around the room.</p>
<p>“Why can’t this work? Okay, it’s sudden, and okay, it’s crazy, but so what? There’s a city that needs help, thousands of people that could starve if someone doesn’t do something? Why not us?”</p>
<p>“Why should we do it?”</p>
<p>That came from Ulrien. Jelaqua glared, but Ulrien’s face wasn’t hostile. He was impassive, questioning. Erin stared at the big man without flinching.</p>
<p>“Because it’s the right thing to do. And I’ll make you a huge lunch for the road. Plus, you’ll be famous if you help.”</p>
<p>Ulrien thought about that for a few seconds, and then glanced at Halrac. The [Scout] nodded. Ulrien looked back at Erin and gave her a slight smile.</p>
<p>“We’re in. We’ll help—free of charge.”</p>
<p>“<em>What?</em>”</p>
<p>Revi cried out in shock, but Typhenous smiled and stroked his beard.</p>
<p>“Don’t fuss, Revi. This is for a good cause. Besides, I think this might prove to be quite an entertaining diversion.”</p>
<p>“We’re in too!”</p>
<p>Jelaqua shot to her feet, visibly disappointed not to be the first to offer. Moore stood up as well.</p>
<p>“This is a big undertaking for one day. Are you sure we can do it in the time given?”</p>
<p>Erin smiled up at him. Moore’s lips curved upwards in reply.</p>
<p>“I think we can do it. And if we split up, why not? All we have to do is get someone to yell at the Mage’s Guild in Celum—why not Revi and Typhenous and you? I bet you could scare the socks off of them. And if Halrac, Jelaqua, Ulrien and Seborn all go to visit the Council—”</p>
<p>“Do you think they’d listen to a few Gold-rank adventurers?”</p>
<p>Jelaqua frowned, but Ulrien nodded confidently.</p>
<p>“We’ve talked with city leaders before. It can’t be worse than persuading them to evacuate a neighborhood or muster the local army.”</p>
<p>Halrac was decisive. He seemed to be the most passionate, if his scowl was any indication.</p>
<p>“We can do it. Gold-rank adventurers have the pull, and this is an issue that the city-states agree on. They support one another or they all fall.”</p>
<p>“Huh. Using our authority and good name to influence others. Well, it’s never worked for <em>our</em> team, but I’ll try and help.”</p>
<p>Jelaqua grinned as she pushed her plate back. Erin turned to Klbkch.</p>
<p>“Can you go and talk to your Queen? If she can send, I dunno, some Soldiers and a lot of Workers to help, that would be great. And if your Hive has supplies they can spare like wood and stuff…”</p>
<p>Klbkch seemed torn. At last, he nodded.</p>
<p>“I will speak with her. I cannot promise you she will agree, but I will try, Erin.”</p>
<p>Erin smiled at him.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Klbkch.”</p>
<p>He stopped, wavered. And then Klbkch nodded firmly.</p>
<p>“Forget my last statement. I will obtain what is needed.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. And uh, I hate to ask, but I guess we need to talk to someone in Liscor. Do you know if Watch Captain Zevara could…?”</p>
<p>“Leave the Watch Captain—and the city leaders—to me, Miss Solstice.”</p>
<p>Zel Shivertail walked forwards. He didn’t look at Klbkch as the Antinium stood aside, but he smiled a bit as he stared down at Erin. He seemed bemused, but he too was smiling.</p>
<p>“I think I can get them to pay for a few wagons, at the very least. I’ll head down and talk with them now.”</p>
<p>“Oh, would you really? Thanks so much!”</p>
<p>Erin was full of gratitude, but Zel just shook his head slowly.</p>
<p>“I—it would be my pleasure, Erin. This is a good idea, and a good cause.”</p>
<p>He headed towards the door, catching Lyonette’s eye on the way over. Zel shook his head as she beamed at him.</p>
<p>“What about us, then, Erin?”</p>
<p>Ceria stood with Yvlon, Pisces, and Ksmvr. Erin turned to them, full of excitement and energy as the adventurers began to argue about how best to approach things.</p>
<p>“I need you guys to coordinate Liscor’s Mage Guild. They do have one, right…? Okay, so you guys can charge the door up as much as you can here—Pisces and Ceria, you know how to do that, right? And Yvlon and Ksmvr can help me organize the wagons. There’ll be goods coming through that door fast, so we need a lot of people to haul stuff away—”</p>
<p>“What about us?”</p>
<p>Lyonette came over, excited, Mrsha leaping from table to table as she did. Erin laughed as Moore snagged Mrsha out of the air and put the Gnoll gently down on the ground.</p>
<p>“You can help me clean up and cook more food!”</p>
<p>“Cook? But what about helping…?”</p>
<p>Lyonette’s face fell. Erin shook her head.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to feed everyone, right? All the people hauling food through from Celum and the wagon drivers—not to mention the Antinium and adventurers—we need to make food for all of them!”</p>
<p>The [Barmaid] paled at the thought and Erin laughed again. She turned to the others.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s get to work! Spread the word if you can—we need all the help we can get! I mean, these are a lot of wagons, right? Even with the Antinium Klbkch can get, we need protection in case of monsters or Goblins or…Rock Crabs.”</p>
<p>Jelaqua raised her hand.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we go to the Adventurer’s Guilds instead of the city leaders? We could probably talk a good number into some easy guard duty, especially if the cities will hire them for a day.”</p>
<p>“Good idea!”</p>
<p>Yvlon nodded towards the door.</p>
<p>“And I’ll go find Termin. He’s sure to know all the wagon-drivers in the city.”</p>
<p>“In that case, why don’t I go find Garia and Fals? A few dozen [Runners] could carry quite a bit, especially if they made several trips.”</p>
<p>Ceria nodded towards the already open door as Halrac, Ulrien, Revi, and Typhenous walked through. Erin spotted Octavia trying to intercept the Gold-rank adventurers and they nearly ran the [Alchemist] over. The Horns of Hammerad headed towards the doors, the Halfseekers split up and in moments, the inn was empty save for Lyonette and Mrsha.</p>
<p>The girl and Gnoll stood together, staring around the room. Lyonette stared at Mrsha; Mrsha stared at the open portal door, and then at Lyonette.</p>
<p>“I guess we’d better get to work, huh?”</p>
<p>Mrsha nodded, and stood up on two legs to help carry plates. Lyonette smiled, and stared towards the door Zel had walked out of.</p>
<p>“I <em>told</em> you she’s weird. In a good way.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The city was in an uproar. Which city? Well, Celum was mainly full of chaos, as all the normal day-to-day foot traffic and vehicles found themselves blocked off by [Guardsmen] who escorted rumbling wagons down the street. There was a lot of shouting and confusion. What was happening?</p>
<p>Word spread throughout the city. Apparently, aid was being sent to Esthelm! That news amazed all those who heard it. So soon? Of course, Esthelm needed help, but the roads were not safe! Had something changed?</p>
<p>But the wagons weren’t going towards the gates. Rather, they were going to a small but well-known [Alchemist]’s shop that looked like it was under siege. Countless people were going in and out of the doors, [Laborers] bringing in bag after bag of grain and crates of goods and [Runners] going into the shop but never going out.</p>
<p>In fact, as the day wore on someone created a second door in the shop, and then just knocked the entire wall in, much to Octavia’s displeasure. People streamed towards the shop, not just adventurers and workers, but [Mages] as well!</p>
<p>Something was happening. Something big. People could feel it. Why else would the newly famed [Actors] all rush over to the shop and disappear there? Why would Miss Agnes suddenly throw open her doors to her inn and announce drinks were on her for all the people helping to unload the wagons?</p>
<p>And what, in the name of the Five Families, did an <em>[Alchemist] </em>have to do with sending aid to Esthelm?</p>
<p>Some people knew, but most were out of the loop.</p>
<p>And that was only in Celum. In Liscor, the uproar was more like a furor in truth. The city had not turned out its warehouses to support a Human city, but it had commandeered every Runner, [Wagon Driver], [Rider], and transportation-based class that could be spared, all under the orders of the legendary Zel Shivertail himself.</p>
<p>Mages, drivers, runners, and a gaggle of adventurers milled about outside the city, shouting and being shouted at by a young woman who had developed quite the reputation in the city by now. A lot of the Drakes and Gnolls just resigned themselves to it; it was that crazy Human doing something weird again. But more stopped their work to watch the fun, and more still found themselves joining in when they heard what was going on.</p>
<p>Some were friends of Selys or part of Krshia’s clan, and found themselves lending a paw, claw, or hand to help. Others were more impressed by the legendary Gold-rank adventurers and Zel Shivertail, and helped because he was lifting supplies effortlessly into wagons. Some just cared about Humans, as odd as it was.</p>
<p>But all that was a backdrop, meaningless babble to what was going on below. The Queen of the Free Antinium under Liscor sat in her throne room, staring down at the strangers standing before her.</p>
<p>The Antinium of four Hives stood before her, each one in their own group. The Prognugator Tersk, leading the three Armored Antinium who had come with him. Revalantor Pivr of the Flying Antinium and his cohort of six. Two soldiers of the Quiet Antinium, almost invisible in the darkness. And Xrn, of the Centenium, now a Prognugator to the Grand Queen with her six bodyguards.</p>
<p>Of this group, it was only Xrn that the Queen of the Free Antinium was interested in, and only her that she respected. But annoyingly, it wasn’t Xrn who was speaking right now.</p>
<p>“…And after my extensive surveying of your Hive, I have found only four of these so-called Individuals who have obtained formal designations. Moreover, they have not obtained any significant levels, Skills, or classes as of yet. In my role as Revalantor for my Queen, I must ask whether this is truly an accomplishment that merits the attention of the Hives.”</p>
<p>Pivr’s voice echoed throughout the Queen’s chambers as all the Antinium stared at him. It was hard to read the other’s expressions, but the Queen felt they were getting annoyed by him. She certainly was.</p>
<p>His voice was higher in pitch than the other Antinium, and he moved about restlessly, fanning his wings when he stood still. Was he showing them off? The Queen had seen the true winged soldiers of the Antinium, long ago. She wasn’t impressed by the Queen of the Flying Antinium’s half-baked copies.</p>
<p>“So you have said. Repeatedly. But my achievement is extraordinary regardless of number. In fact, the rarity of such Individuals proves their worth. How many Prognugators does your Hive have, Pivr? How many Individuals has your Queen created?”</p>
<p>He ignored that question, as he had the ones before. Pivr seemed uniquely gifted at ignoring things he or his Queen didn’t want to see. As the Queen, so followed the Prognugator.</p>
<p>“I must simply ask how feasible the use of these Individuals is. Surely, if their creation is a workable method, you would seek to convert the entire Hive thusly? I ask, on behalf of my Queen, what formal plan you would put before the Hives.”</p>
<p>She <em>had</em> no formal plan, just this one accomplishment as the Queen of the Flying Antinium very well knew. The Queen of the Free Antinium tried to keep her temper, but it was hard.</p>
<p>She was angry the other Queens could not understand what they were doing, that they doubted her commitment to the Hives. She was angry that not all of them had sent their Prognugators to witness what she had done, that they questioned, or at least, didn’t trust that what she was doing was significant. She was also angry that Pivr was a pus-filled sack, and she was trying to restrain herself from ordering him killed—or just picking him up and crushing him herself.</p>
<p>The Queen tried to come up with a reply that didn’t include some form of violence, but she was distracted by another matter as well. Klbkch. Why wasn’t he here?</p>
<p>She <em>knew</em> he had returned to the Hive thirty minutes ago, but he had not come directly here, despite her mental summons. What was so important that he would not help her get rid of Pivr, preferably by shoving a sword through the other Antinium’s head?</p>
<p>To mask her irritation, the Queen turned her massive head towards Xrn. The female Antinium—the only one in the room besides the Queen—was standing still, her blue carapace shimmering slightly from the swirling lights reflected in her eyes. How beautiful.</p>
<p>The Queen knew she was the height of creation, an untouched remnant of the original Centenium forms, but she couldn’t help but feel envious. She was so graceful, so perfect. She had been created to embody true perfection, not the flawed shells all the other Antinium here wore.</p>
<p>“What say you, Xrn of the Centenium? What opinion do you have of what has been created here?”</p>
<p>Pivr make a choked <em>clicking</em> sound from the side. But the Queen had addressed Xrn by her old title. It wasn’t exactly correct, but that definitely put her authority far above a Revalantor’s.</p>
<p>Xrn nodded slowly.</p>
<p>“I believe my Queen, the Grand Queen, will wish to explore what you have created a great deal further, oh Queen of the Free Antinium. At the very least, we will request one of the Individuals accompany us back to the Grand Hive to be appraised there. There is significance in this, even if the Individuals cannot be replicated on a large scale as of yet.”</p>
<p>That sounded quite nice to the Queen of the Free Antinium. But she could sense Pivr getting ready for another comeback, probably to discredit her. She was just about ready to tell him he could go back to his Queen and tell her to eat all her eggs when she felt Klbkch approaching. She cut off Pivr with one feeler.</p>
<p>“Ah, I sense my Revalantor returns. Klbkchhezeim will answer any questions you may have, Pivr.”</p>
<p>All heads turned towards the entrance. The Queen waited, hearing the faint footfalls growing louder. Klbkch strode into the room, twin sheathed swords swinging at his waist, light on his feet, slim.</p>
<p>So close to how he used to be. And yet, indescribably far away. The Queen watched Xrn react to Klbkch’s presence. Tensely, and then relaxing. Yes, she felt it too.</p>
<p>This was more like the old Klbkch, the Slayer. But ah, it could never be him, not fully. His form was lost. Lost…</p>
<p>But he was hers, now. The Queen felt satisfaction in that. Klbkch stopped in front of the gathered Antinium and bowed to his Queen first, before nodding to them.</p>
<p>“My Queen, Antinium of the Hives, I must render you all my apologies. I was unavoidably detained last night, and was not able to meet with you as I had hoped.”</p>
<p>She could never be angry at him, not for long. The Queen waved a feeler graciously.</p>
<p>“Your absence was noted, but as always you work for the Hive’s greater good, Klbkchhezeim. All of the Hives.”</p>
<p>The Antinium nodded. He looked up at his Queen, and she felt the slightest thought pass between them. The Queen went still. What was he….?</p>
<p>“This is so. And I am aware of the scrutiny of the other Hives at this instance, so I have attempted to reveal much of where the true effort of our Hive has gone. In fact, I hope you will join me on a small expedition to demonstrate the true value of the Free Antinium of Liscor.”</p>
<p>What was this? The Queen didn’t speak to contradict Klbkch, but her mind was awhirl. Pivr turned to Klbkch, ready to pounce on any imperfections.</p>
<p>“Indeed, Klbkch? Your absence speaks to a lack of resources in the Hive. Could not an Individual have performed such tasks? What is this errand which will occupy a Revalantor of the Hive when he is needed elsewhere?”</p>
<p>Klbkch gave Pivr a look that made it clear the other Revalantor was not worth the syllables in his name. He turned to face the others, especially, the Queen thought, Xrn.</p>
<p>“The nature of the upcoming mission at hand is simple. I, as well as a group of one hundred and fifty Soldiers and twice that number of Workers, are travelling north to the Human city of Esthelm, escorting a convoy of supplies. We will be staying in the city for several days to provide aid to the citizens there.”</p>
<p>The Antinium did not waste time on shocked silence. Instead, they all spoke more or less at the same time. Pivr was the first. He exclaimed, spitting a bit of venom in surprise.</p>
<p>“<em>What?</em>”</p>
<p>Xrn next. Her voice was flat.</p>
<p>“What.”</p>
<p>Tersk, spreading his arms, open, honest.</p>
<p>“I do not understand.”</p>
<p>And the Queen. She couldn’t help it. The word slipped out.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Fortunately, no one noticed. Tersk addressed Klbkch, speaking for the others.</p>
<p>“Revalantor Klbkch, I would ask that you explain your Hive’s reasoning for sending aid to this city. I see no immediate merit in such an action.”</p>
<p>Klbkch nodded. He ignored his Queen’s furious mental probes and explained to the other Antinium calmly.</p>
<p>“It is true that the benefits of such an act will not provide us with any immediate benefits. However, there are intangible benefits to such an act, and it costs the Hive very little in terms of resources. What we give will be repaid in the form of goodwill, trust, and friendship. Concepts which mean little to the other Hives, but which I…and my Queen…have grown to understand.”</p>
<p>She could <em>sense</em> the Workers and Soldiers in the Hive moving already! So that was what Klbkch had done! The Queen fumed, but she couldn’t gainsay him, not in front of the others. Why was he doing this? She didn’t understand, not one bit. Rendering aid without reward to a Human city not affiliated with the Hive? Why?</p>
<p>“I see. In that case, I will follow and observe, if you will permit it.”</p>
<p>Tersk nodded. The Queen supposed that was a victory, but she dearly wanted the Antinium to clear the room so she could have Klbkch explain to <em>her</em> what was going on. But Pivr was already talking again, refusing Klbkch’s offer.</p>
<p>“<em>I</em> will not. I will stay and observe this Hive, and perhaps see what dangers lurk in this dungeon which consumes so many resources. An expedition is not what I came here to witness.”</p>
<p>A pity. But, the Queen thought to herself privately, she might be able to organize it so a monster broke through and slaughtered Pivr by accident. The Flesh Worms were quite lethal, even when she deployed many Soldiers to counter them.</p>
<p>“I will go as well.”</p>
<p>Xrn spoke up, and the Queen saw Klbkch’s mandibles part and raise in an Antinium smile. She <em>really</em> didn’t like that, but it was too late to stop any of them. She stared down at Klbkch.</p>
<p>“I wish you success on your task, Klbkch. Do not take too long, however. We have much to do…and discuss…when you return.”</p>
<p>He didn’t so much as flinch at the tone in her voice. Well, he wouldn’t. Klbkch bowed and left the room, leaving the Queen in the darkness to think.</p>
<p>And wonder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“So tell me, is this what made you abandon our discussion last night and not return?”</p>
<p>Xrn’s tone was slightly acidic as she and Tersk—and their escort of lesser Antinium—followed him through the Hive. Klbkch nodded.</p>
<p>“There is merit in this, Xrn.”</p>
<p>“I understand that, even if your Queen and the others did not seem to. But I do not understand why <em>you</em> of all beings would see it.”</p>
<p>Klbkch made no answer. He clicked his mandibles together in embarrassment, the Antinium version of clearing his throat—although he could do that too.</p>
<p>“We will join up with the Antinium escort shortly. I have been specially approved by Liscor’s Watch Captain to take the force out of the city.”</p>
<p>“Oh? How exciting.”</p>
<p>“Yes. It is, in fact. As you will soon see. For this mission, I have chosen one of our newest Soldier units to escort the convoy. They are…uniquely prepared to foster goodwill and reduce alarm among the other species.”</p>
<p>That made Xrn pause, but she followed Klbkch out of one of the secret tunnels in the Hive and onto the snowy plain. The instant she and Tersk entered the sunlight they stopped and gasped.</p>
<p>All of the Antinium did. For a second, they paused and stared. Not because they hadn’t ever seen Soldiers before, but because they had never seen Soldiers like this.</p>
<p>Painted. Colorful. Some with every color of the rainbow—and several colors not of the rainbow—on their bodies, and some with only a few markings. But each one was unique. Distinct.</p>
<p>Individual.</p>
<p>Klbkch stopped next to Pawn, Belgrade, Anand, and Bird. They stood at attention, nervous, silent, in front of the ranks of Soldiers and Workers. Tersk and Xrn came forwards to inspect them.</p>
<p>“These are the Individuals? Well met.”</p>
<p>Tersk greeted the four. Belgrade, Bird, and Anand didn’t speak, but Pawn opened his mandibles until Klbkch shot him a look.</p>
<p>“These are Anand, Belgrade, Bird, and Pawn.”</p>
<p>“You did not introduce me to this Pawn before.”</p>
<p>Xrn spoke as she observed the Soldiers. Tersk had already moved past the Individuals, much to Klbkch’s relief. The armor-wearing Antinium’s voice was puzzled as he turned to Klbkch.</p>
<p>“Revalantor Klbkch, I am uncertain as to the reason behind decorating these Soldiers so. It seems to be a waste of resources.”</p>
<p>“Are you? I would assume the reason is obvious. They are Individual. Unique.”</p>
<p>Klbkch nodded to the Soldiers, not sure if he was lying or only telling a partial truth. Tersk’ breath caught and he closed his mandibles slowly.</p>
<p>“I see. I see. This changes much.”</p>
<p>“Everything.”</p>
<p>Xrn walked past the Soldiers as they stood in perfect ranks. Klbkch knew their attention was on her; the azure body of the Small Queen was as striking as their paint. She too was like them; completely separate from the nameless mass of other Antinium.</p>
<p>“I take it you approve?”</p>
<p>“I love it.”</p>
<p>She turned to him, and Klbkch saw the swirling colors in her eyes grow brighter. He opened his mandibles in a smile.</p>
<p>“I shall appraise you of the decision to paint the Soldiers as we march. We shall proceed, unless there are objections?”</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>“None. Let us go see what defines the Free Antinium.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later that day, the road leading from Liscor north to the Human lands was empty. Empty, that was, except for one vehicle.</p>
<p>The lone wagon rumbled slowly down the road. It was a familiar group sitting in it. Ceria, Erin, Yvlon, Ksmvr, and Termin all sat, eating a quick mid-day lunch as they headed north through the snowy landscape. Well, Erin, Yvlon, Ksmvr, and Termin sat. Ceria and Pisces were more comatose bodies slowly chewing their food as they lay in the back of the wagon on some crates.</p>
<p>“I’m just saying, it makes no sense! Why wouldn’t you want to go see your brother at all? I get that you don’t want him to be annoying and fuss over you, but you don’t <em>ever</em> want to see him?”</p>
<p>Yvlon sighed and brushed away some crumbs Erin had accidentally spat on her.</p>
<p>“The instant he finds me, he’ll try to take me back to our home, no objections. He’s not just protective. He’d never accept me being—crippled and continuing to adventure like this.”</p>
<p>“Oh. But he’s got your best interests at home. What if your family could help? I mean, with your arms…?”</p>
<p>Erin gingerly indicated the fused metal and flesh on Yvlon’s forearms, but the woman shook her head.</p>
<p>“If our family had a potion or artifact that could regenerate bones or limbs, we wouldn’t be a minor house in Izril. We’re known for having an adventurer or warrior in each generation—and having the first letter in our names be ‘y’. That’s all.”</p>
<p>“Well, I guess I understand. But you can’t run from your brother forever.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need to. As soon as he gets word of a village in trouble he’ll drop everything and run off. He <em>is</em> a [Knight].”</p>
<p>“Huh.”</p>
<p>“Hold up, you lot. There’s something on the road ahead.”</p>
<p>Termin suddenly called out in alarm, and Erma and Fox stopped in their tracks as he halted the wagon. All the adventurers immediately sat up, but they relaxed when they saw what it was.</p>
<p>“That’s not a monster!”</p>
<p>Erin chortled as she pointed at the creature that had caused Termin to stop his wagon. It was a beaver, sitting in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>“It’s a beaver. Why are you afraid of a beaver, Termin?”</p>
<p>Termin glared at Erin as he pointed to the beaver.</p>
<p>“That’s no ordinary beaver, Miss! It’s a Fortress Beaver, not one of your cute little rodents. See how large it is, even from here? It could bite my wheels in two in one go and probably take your leg off if you angered it. And where there’s one, there might be more. I’m not risking my wagon or my horses if I accidentally agitate it.”</p>
<p>Erin looked again, frowning. Now that she thought about it, the beaver certainly did look…<em>big</em> from so far away. It would be up to her chest—maybe up to her neck if she got close. She gulped.</p>
<p>“Okay, don’t pet the beaver. Well, can’t we get rid of it?”</p>
<p>Both she and Termin turned to look at the adventurers. Yvlon shook her head.</p>
<p>“I’m not killing a beaver.”</p>
<p>“I volunteer—”</p>
<p>“No, no.”</p>
<p>Erin hastily pushed down Ksmvr’s hand and turned in her seat. She poked the person lying behind her.</p>
<p>“Ceria. Hey, Ceria.”</p>
<p>“Wuh?”</p>
<p>One of the two comatose bodies raised its head. Ceria looked pale and exhausted, drained from using up all her mana, but she managed to get up to stare at the beaver.</p>
<p>“Can you get rid of it? You can talk to animals, right? Can you get it off the road so Termin can keep going?”</p>
<p>The half-Elf glared in outrage at Erin.</p>
<p>“Dead gods. <em>Erin.</em> Just because I’m a half-Elf, doesn’t mean I…well, I <em>do</em>, but why do you always turn to me to—”</p>
<p>She looked around the wagon. Everyone was staring at her. Termin cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“Well, do you or don’t you? I don’t speak beaver.”</p>
<p>Ceria growled, and pushed herself up. Grouchily, she stood up and moved to the front of the wagon, grumbling under her breath.</p>
<p>“It’s not like I <em>want </em>to learn this stuff. Fine, I’ll get it to move.”</p>
<p>She cupped her hands and took a deep breath. Erin was expecting her to chitter to the beaver, or make whatever sound they made, but Ceria just started shouting. The beaver’s head turned as she yelled at it.</p>
<p>“<em>Hey you! Yeah, you! Piss off!</em>”</p>
<p>The Fortress Beaver stared as Ceria shouted at it. It seemed to think about what the half-Elf had said, and then waddled off of the road.</p>
<p>“There. Done.”</p>
<p>Ceria let her hands fall and turned. Everyone was staring at her, Erin with a betrayed look in her eyes. Ceria shrugged defensively.</p>
<p>“What? That’s how you talk to animals if you want them to move.”</p>
<p>She sat back down and Termin flapped his reins, shaking his head. Erin felt a rumbling on the ground and looked around.</p>
<p>“Hey, hurry up Termin. I think the others are catching up.”</p>
<p>The Fortress Beaver, which had considered going back to take a bite out of the wagon anyways, felt the rumbling and made itself scarce. A good thing too, because the army of marching Antinium would have squashed it flat if the sea of wagon wheels didn’t do that before them.</p>
<p>As Termin got his cart moving, carts appeared in the distance behind him. Carts driven by Humans, Gnolls, Drakes, and in one case, driving itself since the driver had fallen off but the horses kept going. Each one was loaded to the brim with food, supplies, and people. There were more than a hundred adventurers, [Guardspeople], and other experts such as [Healers], [Masons], [Hunters], and more who had come to aid Esthelm.</p>
<p>And marching to one side of the road came the Antinium. Rows upon rows of Workers, dragging primitive wooden sleds loaded with materials of their own—nails, wood, hammers, but no food since what they ate was disgusting—led by a group of Antinium including Pawn at the front.</p>
<p>Erin beamed as the massive group began to catch up. Termin had left with a good lead on the others, but everyone was moving fast. It wasn’t evening yet, and they were nearly at Esthelm!</p>
<p>“You’re lucky so many of these wagon drivers have movement Skills.”</p>
<p>Pisces commented to Erin as he raised his head from his bed in the wagon. Termin cackled.</p>
<p>“Luck’s got nothing to do with it, necromancer. Around here you either move fast or you get eaten by something sooner or later. A Skill like [Continuous Rolling] is common for all us folk.”</p>
<p>The necromancer sniffed.</p>
<p>“Well then, she was lucky you all decided the roads were safe. Why did you decide to take the journey, pray tell Mister Termin? Surely you are aware such a convoy would be at risk of being attacked? Why not travel with an army from Celum?”</p>
<p>“Hah! Any army the Human cities could put together wouldn’t be half as powerful as an army led by Zel Shivertail himself! Add two groups of Gold-rank adventurers to the mix, the famous Horns of Hammerad—not to mention the Antinium Soldiers, and the Goblin Lord himself would look twice before taking us on!”</p>
<p>Before Pisces could open his mouth again, Erin leapt up in her seat and nearly fell off the wagon.</p>
<p>“Oh look, look! I can see the city from here! Wow, it still looks terrible!”</p>
<p>Esthelm came into view, and as soon as their wagon approached, Erin heard people on the walls shouting. But as more wagons were spotted, the shouting grew confused, and then jubilant. People began cheering and streaming out of the gates before Termin’s wagon had gotten close—then they saw the Antinium and ran back into the city.</p>
<p>In the end, Erin drove up to the gates. The people of Esthelm didn’t exactly shut the gates, but they met her and the wagon at them. The [Soldier] who had met Erin and the Horns of Hammerad two days ago was there, with a group of armed men who looked incredulously at the approaching force. Erin waved down at Umbral excitedly.</p>
<p>“Hi! Remember me? Well, I came back and I brought a lot of stuff to help! And a lot of people!”</p>
<p>His jaw dropped.</p>
<p>“You? You’re that [Innkeeper]! But how did—”</p>
<p>“It’s supplies and a relief force! From Celum <em>and</em> Liscor! And the Antinium! They’ve come to help fix your walls and guard your city!”</p>
<p>“The Antinium? <em>Here?</em>”</p>
<p>He seemed unable to process it all. Erin jumped down from the wagon and then sat down hard. Her legs had gone to sleep.</p>
<p>“Ow. Um. Well, it’s a long story, but these Antinium are really nice. They’ve brought a lot of stuff, and we have food, blankets, pillows, and so on. We even have—”</p>
<p>She got no further, because Umbral pulled her up and into a hug. Erin heard the cheering begin again as word began to spread.</p>
<p>“Aid has come to Esthelm!”</p>
<p>“Liscor! The Drakes have come to help us!”</p>
<p>“Esthelm is saved!”</p>
<p>Everyone was being thanked, except perhaps the Antinium. But Pisces summed it up best. He smiled, perhaps arrogantly, but with genuine pleasure at Umbral as the man let go of Erin. He nodded to the huge convoy and then at Erin.</p>
<p>“You may attribute this delivery to Erin Solstice, proprietress of the Wandering Inn. We can discuss remuneration for goods and services rendered at a later—”</p>
<p>He got no further then that, because Erin kicked him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The city of Esthelm was saved. Only, it had already been saved. In a sense, you could say it was saved again, at least from the pressing needs of hunger, thirst, and the need for shelter. Pawn considered that this was less glamorous than saving the city from invading monsters, but no less necessary.</p>
<p>He stood in the ruined center of the city with his group of painted Soldiers, staring in awe at the buildings, the people, and the broken sewers that stank beyond belief. It was all new to him. He had never gone beyond Liscor, never seen so many Humans, or seen a city this badly destroyed. He knew his Soldiers hadn’t seen anything like this either, and he was glad to have shown it to them.</p>
<p>And yet, Pawn was also uncertain. Because while the others who had come seemed to know what they were doing, he did not. And that was a problem, because <em>he </em>was in charge of the Antinium here.</p>
<p>Klbkch had explained it to him quickly, which was to say confusingly, a few moments before they had left. Pawn was in charge because Klbkch had to deal with the Antinium from the other Hives. He had to speak with the Antinium in armor and the beautiful blue <em>female</em> Antinium for reasons unknown to Pawn. Thus, Pawn was in charge.</p>
<p>Which again, would be fine if Pawn knew what to <em>do.</em> But he didn’t. Oh, the Drakes, Gnolls, and Humans seemed well-organized enough. They were already unloading the wagons, the soldiers and guardspeople keeping order while carpenters, masons, and other groups split off to help aid the city. But Pawn was standing with over a hundred Soldiers and three hundred Workers in the middle of the city with not a clue of what to do now.</p>
<p>He badly wanted to go find Erin and ask, but Pawn realized that might not be an option right now. He had to do something. So he cleared his throat and looked around.</p>
<p>What could be done? Well, what <em>couldn’t</em> be done? Pawn was no expert on cities, but he felt sure that walls shouldn’t be falling down, there shouldn’t be exposed sewers, and that Humans preferred a roof over their heads as they slept. He pointed randomly at a particularly bad section of the wall and turned to his sub-leaders, Belgrade and Anand.</p>
<p>“Our job is to assist in repairing this city. Thus, I think that wall is…a good place to start? Belgrade, Anand, if you will take that wall and uh, effect repairs on it? Reinforce it? Make it taller or something?”</p>
<p>“Certainly, Pawn.”</p>
<p>“It will be done.”</p>
<p>The two [Tacticians] nodded immediately and began walking towards the wall. Workers and Soldiers both streamed after them, making Pawn jump. Belgrade and Anand needed no spoken instructions to command the Soldiers. Somehow, they’d learned the trick of Prognugators, to command without speaking, mind-to-mind.</p>
<p>Well, that was easy. Pawn turned and nearly had one of his hearts stop when he found Bird standing right in front of him. The Antinium seemed…focused as he held a bow in his hands. An arrow was already nocked.</p>
<p>“There are many birds here. I must go hunt them.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Certainly, Bird. Go ahead. Ah, be sure to bring the birds back so they may be eaten, alright?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Bird hurried off, already staring at the sky. Pawn turned around, and then around, and realized everyone had left. Belgrade and Anand were already having Soldiers clear the rubble while Workers moved about preparing tools and forming neat rows to expedite the work flow.</p>
<p>Now Pawn felt lonely. He thought about what he should do next, and remembered something Erin had told him last night. He looked around, saw a familiar tail, and hurried towards it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I see what you mean. I see it.”</p>
<p>Zel Shivertail muttered to himself as he walked through the city of Esthelm, gazing at the destruction. He felt a small pang in his heart as he saw how much devastation had been done, but the rest of him just felt mystified.</p>
<p>Why was he here? How had he come to be here, in Esthelm, helping to distribute aid to the citizens? He could have sworn he was eating rolls with honey just this morning.</p>
<p>It was all because of that girl. Erin Solstice. It hadn’t been a unique idea, to help Esthelm. Anyone with at least one heart would have thought of that. And it wasn’t hard to think of a door being used to transport things like goods. That was an obvious use. But convincing two cities to send supplies and help, and asking the Antinium, the <em>Antinium</em> no less to render assistance?</p>
<p>“…Who is she?”</p>
<p>That was what Zel Shivertail asked himself. He could admit when he’d misjudged someone. He’d done that with Erin Solstice. He still kept part of his original opinion, but now he revised the rest. Something was off about that girl. Something was extremely off, in a way he could only attribute to one other Human before…</p>
<p>“Excuse me, General Shivertail?”</p>
<p>Zel turned. He expected to see one of the Drakes, asking for him to sign his tail or something silly like that, or a Human, asking for help. But he froze when he saw the Antinium standing meekly in front of him.</p>
<p>Instinct told Zel to rip the Ant’s head off. He restrained himself—with effort. Zel growled as he took a few steps back.</p>
<p>“What do you want?”</p>
<p>The Antinium nodded politely.</p>
<p>“My name is Pawn.”</p>
<p>“You have a name?”</p>
<p>Zel was incredulous. But he caught himself—this was one of the new Antinium, the ones all the damn Drake politicians and leaders were telling him to find out about. Pawn nodded.</p>
<p>“I do. I ah, have been sent to aid in restoring Esthelm.”</p>
<p>“Good. For you.”</p>
<p>Zel didn’t want to talk with any Antinium, even a new one. But Pawn clearly wanted to talk with him. The Antinium cleared his throat nervously.</p>
<p>“I was hoping I might converse with you, General Shivertail. I understand you are a famous General among the Drakes—”</p>
<p>“I fought in the Antinium War. <em>Both</em> Antinium Wars.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>The two stared at each other. Zel forced his fist to unclench. Pawn studied him carefully.</p>
<p>“I am not hostile towards you, General Shivertail. I do not wish to offend you either. I simply wish to talk.”</p>
<p>“Yeah? Well, I don’t want to talk to you.”</p>
<p>Zel forced himself not to shout. Pawn tilted his head sideways.</p>
<p>“May I ask why?”</p>
<p>“You’re an Antinium. I saw your kind ravage my continent. You still do. You infest part of my home. I saw your Soldiers slaughter thousands of innocents.”</p>
<p>“Yes. They did. But I was created long after those wars. I am not like my people. I am not like anyone.”</p>
<p>There was something in the Antinium’s eyes—Zel looked away. He controlled his voice, spoke levelly.</p>
<p>“Look, An—Pawn. I came here to help the Humans here, because it was the right thing to do. Because it was a good cause, understand? And I tolerated your Hive sending an army here, though I’d rather kill you all, because you lot are helping too. I won’t pick a fight with your kind, but it doesn’t mean I have to like you, or talk with you. I lost too many friends, too many comrades to your species to ever think of you as anything but the enemy. Understand?”</p>
<p>Silence. And then Zel saw Pawn nod out of the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>“I understand. But I did not come here to be friends. I came to ask—you see, I have been placed in command of my own force. I am a…leader. But I do not know how to lead.”</p>
<p>“So? The Antinium lead themselves, or the Queens do, don’t they?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but she has entrusted that role to me. I must lead, but I do not know how. That is why I have come to you. You are a Drake [General], one of the greatest leaders on this continent.”</p>
<p>Zel Shivertail stared incredulously at Pawn.</p>
<p>“You want me to give you…<em>advice</em> on how to lead an army?”</p>
<p>Pawn nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Why in the name of the Ancestors would I do that?”</p>
<p>The Antinium shrugged. He seemed at a loss in front of Zel’s questioning stare.</p>
<p>“I do not know. I simply hoped you would. Because you understand the burdens of leadership.”</p>
<p>Zel turned away in disgust.</p>
<p>“I’ve never taken on a pupil. If you want to ask for training, go find Niers Astoragon, or some Human [Lord] like Lord Tyrion Veltras.”</p>
<p>“They are far away.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care.”</p>
<p>Zel turned to go. Pawn called out behind him.</p>
<p>“One question, please. Answer me one question, General Shivertail.”</p>
<p>General Shivertail gritted his teeth and lashed his tail.</p>
<p>“If I do, will you go away and stop bothering me from now on?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Fine. Ask.”</p>
<p>Pawn was silent for a moment. Zel was about to snap when the Antinium spoke.</p>
<p>“What do you tell a soldier under your command when he is dying?”</p>
<p>The world paused. Zel turned back. Pawn went on.</p>
<p>“You see, I do not know what to say. I can only hold them, but I do not know what is supposed to be said. But there must be something. What do you say?”</p>
<p>The Drake stared at the Antinium. Down at the Antinium. He realized that Pawn was small. He wasn’t a Soldier. He was a Worker, no fighter. He didn’t even have a weapon at his side. For a second, Zel wrestled with himself, and then one part won. He sighed, and gingerly beckoned Pawn.</p>
<p>“Come on. Walk with me.”</p>
<p>Pawn hesitated, but then followed Zel. The Drake stared up at the sky, at the Antinium swarming over a wall and putting it back together bit by bit, and at the Humans, Drakes, and Gnolls all working together in this city. Because of a girl. Because of an innkeeper. And he walked side by side with an Antinium and told him what to say, what you could say, what you had to say when you held a soldier in your arms.</p>
<p>“You tell them this. You tell them they did a good job, that they can rest. That you’ve never seen anyone fight that hard, that it’s only a scratch. That it’s going to be okay—”</p>
<p>“Even if it is not?”</p>
<p>“Especially then. You tell them what they need to hear. And sometimes, what they need to hear is nothing. Sometimes you just hold their claw and say goodbye. Sometimes…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Klbkch saw Pawn walking next to Zel Shivertail and couldn’t believe his eyes. He almost didn’t believe Xrn’s, but she had seen it too.</p>
<p>“What a strange thing.”</p>
<p>That was all she said. She hadn’t said much, just taken in everything on the march to Esthelm. Klbkch got the impression Xrn was saving up all her words for when she’d sorted out her feelings. Guiltily, he was looking forward to her reaction when it all came out.</p>
<p>But for now, Klbkch just walked with Tersk and Xrn through Esthelm, explaining things for the other two Antinium, but Tersk mainly. Klbkch kept having to pause and stare at the people working, though. He felt a little twinge in his chest every time he saw a Human look up, jump at the sight of him, and then gingerly wave, or at the very least, not flee screaming.</p>
<p>They came to an open square, where the smell of cooking was making Klbkch long for dinner already. He had already explained to the others that they would be eating Human, Drake, and Gnoll foods on this expedition—this seemed to have raised their morale quite a bit.</p>
<p>But now Klbkch saw Erin, standing in the center of the square, next to a grave blooming with flowers and a rather tall stone marker, speaking energetically to a small group of Humans, two Gnolls, and a Drake. She had found a [Flautist], a man with a crude bell that was probably used to sound the alarm, a man holding a harp, and a group of people who could sing.</p>
<p>“Revalantor Klbkch, what is that group of people doing?”</p>
<p>Klbkch paused. He was unsure, although he thought he knew.</p>
<p>“I think they’re—”</p>
<p>All at once, Erin broke into song. She sang loud and clearly, startling everyone around her. They stared at her as the girl started singing a song that Ryoka Griffin would have recognized instantly.</p>
<p>“<em>Dashing through the snow, in a one-skeleton open sledge, o’er the fields we go, screaming all the way! Bells on Gnoll-tails ring, making spirits bright…</em>”</p>
<p>She gestured, and the man with the bell began hitting it rhythmically. The Antinium watched as Erin tried to teach the rest of the appropriated lyrics to the others. He could hear her shouting.</p>
<p>“Come on, you don’t know this song? It’s famous! Don’t tell me you guys don’t have <em>Christmas!?</em> I’ve got so much to teach you all! Alright, on three, okay? One, two…”</p>
<p>“Revalantor Klbkch, I do not understand. What is the purpose of this?”</p>
<p>Tersk whispered it to Klbkch as the group began to sing. Klbkch heard the melody drifting throughout the city, caught by a breeze of wind. It was such a simple song, and yet it had a power of its own. People began to hum the song, or join in after a few repetitions.</p>
<p>“What confuses you, Prognugator Tersk?”</p>
<p>“What is the purpose of such an activity? Could not these people aid in some other task to better effect?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps. But this is important too. It will inspire others to work faster. And…it has a value of its own.”</p>
<p>“Which is?”</p>
<p>Revalantor turned his face up to the sky as the music began to spread. He smiled, and wished he could close his eyes. He could not, so he just said one word.</p>
<p>“Listen.”</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In the city of Esthelm there was a slime. It oozed along the ground, leaving a trail as it went. It was a slime, a round little pebble of liquid with no real defining features besides its dark greenish brown insides, which pulsated as it moved.</p>
<p>But it <em>was</em> a slime, and as of such it attracted a young woman who followed it as it slowly roamed across the broken rubble of the city. Erin Solstice stared, captivated by the tiny slime. It was like a small puddle come to life, and it looked incredibly cute to her, even if she was inhaling a noxious odor from the nearby sewer.</p>
<p>She wanted to touch it. Erin was vaguely aware that even the cutest of monsters could be dangerous, but she assumed that a truly dangerous creature would have been destroyed on sight. So a touch wouldn’t hurt, right? She reached out to touch it.</p>
<p>Above the city of Esthelm there was a herd of faeries. They held their breath as Erin reached out.</p>
<p>“Erin! Don’t touch that!”</p>
<p>Someone shouted at the girl and the faeries released their breath in a collective sigh of disappointment. They watched as a half-Elf ran over to Erin, scowling. Erin turned, looking hurt.</p>
<p>“What? Why not?”</p>
<p>“Erin, you can’t just go around touching monsters—especially <em>slimes!</em>”</p>
<p>“Why? It doesn’t look that dangerous! What, is it acid or something?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be insane. <em>Acid</em> slimes? Dead gods, Erin, what a thought! No, this one is…look, do you know what slimes are? How they’re made?”</p>
<p>“Noooo….”</p>
<p>“It’s very simple.”</p>
<p>Ceria took a step back, pulling Erin away from the slime. It had begun rolling towards them, more inquisitively than with any real hostility. The half-Elf made a face.</p>
<p>“Look, slimes are…well, they’re closer to Golems than anything else, although they <em>are </em>alive. Actually, they’re closer to jellyfish. Um. Do you know what those are?”</p>
<p>“Of course I do!”</p>
<p>Erin looked insulted. Ceria shrugged.</p>
<p>“Some people have never seen the sea before. Anyways, slimes breed or spawn in bodies of liquid when the conditions are right. I guess some mana potions broke, or there were some already but—Erin, they take on the properties of their original liquid, get it? And this one clearly came from the sewer.”</p>
<p>The watching faeries saw Erin take a second to piece this together. Then they heard her horrified exclamation.</p>
<p>“Wait, you mean this is a <em>poo slime?</em> Aw!”</p>
<p>They laughed as she practically ran away from the small slime. It wasn’t as satisfying as if she’d stuck her hand in it—or if she’d fallen and put her face in the slime—but it would have to do.</p>
<p>The faeries flew across the city, pointing out more amusing sights for each other as they went. Esthelm was full of activity and four different species all trying to work together, which was a highly amusing sight for the watching fae.</p>
<p>That they didn’t swoop down and cause havoc or play tricks was perhaps the only sympathy the fae had to the people of Esthelm. At the moment they were content to simply be amused at mortal antics. What truly revealed their soft hearts though, was the fact that it had stopped snowing over Esthelm, even though fat snowflakes were falling several hundred meters away.</p>
<p>The fae loved children, sweets, mortal fools and heroes, and tricks. Other things too of course, but those were fairly universal aspects among their kind. Only a few, the old or the odd, liked actually interfering with the fates to any real degree.</p>
<p>Ivolethe didn’t like to meddle in mortal affairs, let alone Human, but she was of the mind it had to be done. And while she could watch Erin throwing rocks at the sewer slime forever, she reluctantly decided it was time.</p>
<p>She chattered to her fellow faeries and flew off. She had a mission, or rather, a cause. It wasn’t necessarily fun, but she knew it was important. The reason and end was important, even if the doing of it was a pain.</p>
<p>So the faerie flew away from Esthelm to a far more boring place. She flew up and up, and then sideways, and then in a direction not describable by words. Ivolethe flew through part of the world, and then flew through the air in the world and out of an empty bit of space behind a few books in a bookshelf. She sneezed and grumbled, brushing off dust from her wings as she circled the room.</p>
<p>It was a very large room, and very grand too, although decorations had been forgone for a more austere, solemn appearance. This was a library, and the towering bookcases were imposing, despite the rich wood that made up their frames. The books were all first-edition, spotless, and magical too. Ivolethe flew by them, seeing the spells worked into the bindings to keep the pages from dirt or harm.</p>
<p>And in that room sat a girl. She was Asian, dark haired, slightly darker of skin than most Humans on this continent, and taller than most Human females, if not Drake or Gnolls. She was athletic, her body toned, and could be considered attractive. Ivolethe personally thought Ryoka looked far too Human, but she had some affection for her ugly friend.</p>
<p>But that affection ended when she saw Ryoka was <em>still </em>reading. The girl was sitting in a chair, knees drawn to her chest, flipping through a large and rather heavy tome whose pages looked like they had been gilded with gold. The girl did not notice Ivolethe flying towards her at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“<em>Stop reading, ye daft cow!</em>”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe screamed in Ryoka’s left ear. The girl jumped and tried to get out of the chair and twist simultaneously. The chair rocked backwards and she hit the ground.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe! <em>Damn it, </em>don’t do that!”</p>
<p>Ryoka swore as she picked herself up. She reached for the book and made sure it wasn’t damaged before she glared at the faerie. But the little Frost Faerie was full of far more wroth than Ryoka; she buzzed around the young woman, shouting angrily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Put down that book, fool! Go outside and <em>do something! </em>‘Tis been forever and a day since you decided to stay here; stop dawdling and act!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka scowled. She put the book back on the table and turned to it.</p>
<p>“It’s been only a few days. Okay…maybe more, Ivolethe. That’s not forever. Leave me alone and let me read, will you?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Forever is a thought, not a number, fool. And I will not let ye waste away! There are things to be doing! Anything is better than staring at dusk and dead leaves and ink of the past!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe sneered at Ryoka as she hovered in front of the girl’s face, getting in the way of the text. Ryoka swatted at her; Ivolethe danced aside and flew back in the way, impossible to touch.</p>
<p>“Fine. Let me just finish this passage and I’ll go. Happy?”</p>
<p>The faerie scowled and crossed her arms. She blew a stream of icy air upwards, but then acquiesced less than gracefully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“If ye must. But promise to put aside the book! Promise it!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka rolled her eyes, but she did promise. It was an oath made to a faerie, and she would not break that lightly.</p>
<p>“I will be done in thirty minutes. Is that enough?”</p>
<p>Ivolethe shook her head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“One!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Twenty.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“One!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ten minutes, okay?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Well…fine. But hurry up!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka sighed as Ivolethe floated back over to the bookshelves, to go see if Erin had found the dead raccoon corpse that was bobbing in the open sewer main. The young woman turned back to the book, frowning as she lost herself for a few more minutes in the tightly-written scrawl of words.</p>
<p>It had been over a week since the attack on Magnolia’s mansion. A week, and Ryoka had not left yet for Invrisil. Because she had had a thought. And that thought was…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really don’t like faeries. I mean, okay, they’re nice to be around sometimes, and they’re wondrous beings of nature and otherworldly marvels and yadda yadda, etc. But they don’t read. I don’t even think they keep written records; they were around far before the invention of such things, after all.</p>
<p>So they have no patience at all with reading, except I guess if it’s about them. I can imagine a bunch of faeries finding a book about King Arthur or the fae. But they are like children in some respect.</p>
<p>Noisy, angry children who can turn a library into a blizzardy hell if they get bored.</p>
<p>Yes, I’m in Magnolia’s mansion. Yes, it’s been a week since she was attacked. The assassins are all dead, everyone’s patched up—hell, all the damage in the courtyard was gone the next day and I’ll just bet her sitting room is as perfect as it used to be. Magnolia and Ressa left the day after the attack, heading farther north to her estates.</p>
<p>She left me with promises of assistance, subtly dire threats, and Reynold. Apparently he’ll be my guide in Invrisil, which will open some doors I guess. I could go check out the city and get all I need done at any time; hell, I can even take the carriage since I’m going with Reynold. Apparently that’s the second-hand one; Magnolia went off in her personal vehicle which can probably fly and shoot lasers. There’s no one stopping me from leaving.</p>
<p>And yet, I’m still here. Yeah, that’s sort of surprising, but the reason I stayed is simple enough. Or rather, it’s a mix of reasons.</p>
<p>One. I don’t have to go to Invrisil…at least, not to get some good work done. The best thing about being in a mansion full of [Butlers] and [Maids] and [Manservants] is that you can get them to do things. Like haul a bunch of artifacts over to the most reputable [Enchanter] in the city to get them appraised. Magnolia even suggested that bit; she’s willing to foot the not-inconsiderable bill to get them looked at, although I’ll have to be the one to pay for any repairs or what have you. I guess she wants to know what Ceria and the others found.</p>
<p>As for all the deliveries, well, they can wait. A week of waiting for their delivery is still a lot faster than you could ask for, especially since they’re coming all the way from Remendia and because no one else was doing the run.</p>
<p>Right, so I don’t have to leave the mansion. But why would I want to stay? The answer’s simple for me, and I realized it the moment I saw Magnolia heading off in her carriage. When the cat’s away, the mouse has got to play*. Or in this case, the runner girl gets to poke around in her private home and find out all of her dirty little secrets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Damnit, I don’t want to be a mouse. How about a rat? I could live with being a rat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>…Anyways. I failed on that venture. Polite servants get less polite the more intrusive you get, it seems. And while Ressa the ninja-maid is gone, Magnolia’s got some scary maids. The Gnoll one is especially intimidating.</p>
<p>So I failed to pry, but then I remembered that Magnolia has something else which is priceless: books. Frickin’ <em>books.</em> To be more accurate, a library, which is <em>not</em> a common convenience in this world.</p>
<p>And she’s one of the most powerful women in the world. And this is her personal library. How could I not spend some time here figuring out, well, <em>everything?</em> My god, there’s probably more pieces of the puzzle of this world in this room than anywhere else. And…</p>
<p>Yeah. It’s sort of boring trying to do research here. I won’t lie. Ivolethe has a point. It’s been a week. I’ve skimmed through over a hundred books at least, and read from dawn till dusk. I want to burn down this entire library and never read a word of cursive again. If I find the asshole who thought curly writing was a good idea…</p>
<p>At least I have a way to read the books. I push back the pair of bulky lenses over my eyes as I peer at the book in front of me, trying to make the script out. I need these glasses, as ill-fitting and heavy as they are; they’re magical and can translate the multitude of languages in these books.</p>
<p>But somehow, they still don’t translate weird handwriting. I swear, this was written by someone with two left hands. Which, considering the species in this world, might not be too far off.</p>
<p>“<em>‘In the fall of the Strygian Empire we find peace for a time. And yet, the dead still rise from every grave and haunt the few souls still living. Something still calls them back, and Ghouls are but the least of the undead who continue to reanimate. Fifteen Wraiths wiped out a village in one night, and I fear that the curse of the Untombed One still lingers on our land…’</em>”</p>
<p>Heavy stuff. I’ve got a pile of history books around me, and I’m currently reading through an account of some empire which fell a few thousand years back around these parts. I flip past that section. As fascinating as the history might be, I’ve read countless stories like this one.</p>
<p>The history of this world is…vast. As far as I can tell, some accounts claim that civilization was flourishing even twenty thousand years ago. That’s incredible. You’d think that such a world would have entered into a modern or post-modern age, or at least come up with some sort of industrial revolution by now. And yet—</p>
<p>When you read through the accounts of histories, skipping past the triumphal bullshit and the rewritten bits that make out each [King] as the one true savior and so on, it’s a simple picture.</p>
<p>War dominates this world. War, and little else. Each record is the same. War. Peace. War again, after a few decades or just a year. A border conflict between two grand nations escalates; proxy wars break out in five different nations. War drags in an entire continent into war; a second continent begins to fight that one. War. An armistice is declared. More war.</p>
<p>War.</p>
<p>Few nations have the time to develop properly, I guess. Well, they might reach new technological heights, but that’s by this world’s standards, which means it generally comes in the form of mage-powered inventions, not science and steel. But in time, each nation or city will eventually find themselves fighting a battle to the death with someone else.</p>
<p>It’s not Human nature. It’s the nature of all these species. That’s the issue, as I see it. There are countless species in this world and while one species might be content with peace, the others are angry, touchy, prideful, jealous bastards who’ll attack if they think things are unfair, which is, of course, always.</p>
<p>And yet, by the same token, there’s never an end to the cycle, never a victor because it’s too hard. This world is far larger than our own; huge nations the size of the United States or Russia are normal countries around here, or even small. Forging a large empire that would put an end to wars by conquering everything in sight always fails due to a number of factors.</p>
<p>The first is size. It’s too hard to expand and keep supply lines going. Too, a larger nation faces a much greater risk of internal strife or dissent from within. And even if a nation gets a proper transport system and bureaucracy running, such empires usually fail simply because the [Emperor] or [Warlord] gets old and dies.</p>
<p>You can’t conquer the world in one lifetime, not here. And that’s the rest of the twist of this world; nations live and die by their rulers, not like the ones back at home. All the power of a high-level [King], well, once it’s gone a country is easy pickings.</p>
<p>The second factor, then, is probably levels. No nation can ever stay on top just by being bigger. They might have better gear, better training, better economy, but once a high-level individual pops up, even a tiny nation can turn into a powerhouse. Small rebellions that are easily suppressed turn into full-scale revolts as some [Peasant] becomes a [Hero].</p>
<p>Yeah. There were heroes, once. It’s a rare class, but apparently it does exist. I’ve read countless books, pored through them for useful details. One of the things I learned? There is a [Hero] class, even if none of the historians writing the books knows how it can be obtained.</p>
<p>And third? Technology in this world is not the same as in mine. In mine, people build industry and create ideas and inventions that can be built upon, permanent infrastructure like assembly lines and the technology to build steam engines. In this world?</p>
<p>Magic rules. But the problem with that is when an empire dependent on magical innovations loses all of its high-level mages, everything goes right back to the start. If they built huge factories and used machines perhaps the world would change. But I see how easy magic is to use. You can create a carriage that can outrun any vehicle from our world with magic. Hell, it could probably outrun anything but the <em>Shinkansen </em>bullet trains. But you can’t create a hundred, or a thousand. And once the mage who made it dies, so too does the means of creating it.</p>
<p>Stagnation.</p>
<p>The other things I’ve learned? I push the book back and sigh. Ivolethe’s coming back any time now and I’m not feeling too keen on hearing how the Strygian Empire crumbled away. Let’s do a refresher.</p>
<p>“Important things…important things? One. There are no gods. Ever.”</p>
<p>No mention of them. Not one, in over ten thousand years of history, as far as I can tell. It’s hard to figure out the chronological order of the books; they use a dating system based on events, so eras come and go fast. It’s damn annoying, and finding a reference book to make sense of it all is a challenge in itself.</p>
<p>But like I said, no mention of gods. Not once, in thousands of years. Oh, there are hints—references to someone trying to bring back the [Cleric] class, a faded relic here and there, but no gods are ever referenced directly. They’re dead. I wonder why no new ones were ever made? It’s such a discrepancy I can’t quite believe it.</p>
<p>“But that aside—Rhir. It’s always at war. And the Antinium are new.”</p>
<p>Really new. In this millennium new; in this century new, in fact. They just popped up out of nowhere, and that’s odd for Rhir.</p>
<p>Or not. Rhir is a scary place. The more I read about it, the more it seems it’s <em>always </em>been at war. There’s always a Blighted King or Queen, or Blighted Princes…it’s always fighting against some threat or other.</p>
<p>“But it changes. It damn well changes. The Demons are new, too.”</p>
<p>Five thousand years back they emerged, catching a prosperous set of kingdoms off-guard. But they should have expected it, even though they had several hundred years of peace to grow complacent. Because Rhir is always at war.</p>
<p>Sometimes they fight off the enemy—it can be races of any kind. There’s a reference to a Blighted Princess holding off a marauding army of twisted horrors with no real name, but there’s always <em>something.</em> The kingdoms of Rhir, or kingdom in this case, is always fighting a battle. Sometimes they win. Sometimes they lose and the horrors spread across the world.</p>
<p>Huge armies from every corner of the world have come to take back Rhir. They slaughter the monsters, take back the lands, put a nation back there. Everything is peaceful. And then…</p>
<p>I go back to one of the open books on the table, find the passage.</p>
<p>“‘<em>The continent is secure. The last of the tide of Crelers has been purged, although the other nations report infestations in their lands from time to time. Yet Rhir remains safe, apart from a few disturbances reported in underground mining incidents each year. However, infestations of monsters are put to the sword the instant they are uncovered…’</em>”</p>
<p>And then? Black slime pops out, begins mutating everything around it, and this kingdom gets destroyed. I wish I could say I’m making this up. But there’s something in Rhir that keeps creating new things to destroy with.</p>
<p>Something. A dead God. Like Klbkch said.</p>
<p>I shiver. How could no one have known? Well, they did know. People can figure out when something’s wrong. After they fought back the evil slime stuff, a huge army made up of soldiers from three damn continents went underground, searching for the root of their problems. None of them made it back, but one year later a bunch of abominations made from parts of people came out and slaughtered everyone.</p>
<p>What’s the lesson here? Avoid Rhir.</p>
<p>I push the book back, feeling vaguely sick. Ivolethe is right. There are no answers here. Just more things to keep me up at night. If there’s any consolation I have, it’s knowing a bit more about the world.</p>
<p>I knew a lot, or enough, rather. Five main continents. Rhir, Izril, Terandria, Chandrar, and Baleros. Each one with different species, although Humans are on all the continents in some form or other. But it’s the major world powers that are interesting. Aside from the various nations, there are some standouts, some big players.</p>
<p>One of the ones I didn’t know about are the Slave Traders of Roshal. It’s apparently a city, or an empire that keeps itself neutral. It’s based in Chandrar and it’s about as powerful as Wistram, although it’s actually neutral, rather than political like the mages.</p>
<p>Also, the Minotaurs have an archipelago. They feud with other nations—hell, they tried to take over the world a few times, although almost every species has done that over the course of the world. They usually go to war with a bunch of mysterious foreigners—I never found a book about them, but they might be like my world’s version of Japan, or the Philippines. They live at the ‘edge of the world’.</p>
<p>So this world has an edge? Or have people still not figured out that the earth is round? <em>Is</em> it round? I can assume nothing here.</p>
<p>What else? There are Dwarves. Good to know. They live on Terandria, although they used to be everywhere. There used to be harpies, actual intelligent ones with a nation of their own. They’re dead. There used to be a people like djinn—highly magical, part spirit. They’re dead. There used to be undead kingdoms. They’re gone.</p>
<p>There used to be Elves, but every reference in the books I’ve read only talks about <em>half-</em>Elves. When did the Elves die out?</p>
<p>Don’t know. But the Dragons are mostly dead, too. Every few thousand years one gets slain, but the occurrence of such entries grew less and less the more I read. I guess, in a sense, this world <em>is</em> stabilizing. In that species are dying. Perhaps someday, after countless thousands of years, it might be only one or two species left.</p>
<p>Maybe it’ll be Goblins. Because no matter how many times they get wiped out, they always come back. And the reports of what happens when a Goblin King emerges…</p>
<p>I read the book Magnolia told me about, the one about the Second Antinium Wars. Yeah. There were no winners in that war, but it was clear that it was more like the ‘Goblin wars where the Antinium, Az’kerash, and everyone else barely manage to beat him while fighting with each other’.</p>
<p>So much for historical accuracy. I rub at my temples. I have a headache. Is there anything else…?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“You said you would stop reading!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The accusatory voice makes me look up. Ivolethe glares at me. I push the book back.</p>
<p>“I’m done.”</p>
<p>The faerie glares and points. A bit of frost covers the pages of the books. Just a bit; Ivolethe’s magic is apparently very weak inside, even if the library doesn’t have much iron in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“<em>Now</em> ye are. Come on! Time to leave this stuffy place! I crave adventure!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I crave a sub sandwich.”</p>
<p>I mutter as I leave the room. I feel old as I walk through Magnolia’s grand estate, passing by servants who make way for me. I feel old, out of place.</p>
<p>Like an intruder.</p>
<p>It’s still only been a few days since the attack. I’m the only other person in the mansion not in Magnolia’s employ—I did ask about the other people from our world that Erin met, but I got no answers. I’m the odd one out, and I feel it.</p>
<p>Out of the corner of my eye I see a bevy of maids and a man in a black suit coat hurry into the library. They’ve got a lot of reshelving to do. Do I feel guilty about that?</p>
<p>Only slightly.</p>
<p>Ivolethe flies happily through the corridors of the mansion, making people duck out of the way or hurry to one side. She seems to feel safe inside here, so long as Magnolia isn’t around, that is. And she quite enjoys terrorizing the people here.</p>
<p>In fact, one of her favorite targets is just up ahead. Ivolethe smiles widely as she spots him eating through one of the glass windows. I try to stop her, but it’s too late. I sigh and head outdoors. As I do, I smile, just a bit. Today I will go to Invrisil. Reading’s all very well, but I guess I’m just an active sort of person.</p>
<p>And I wouldn’t mind a bit of adventure myself, come to that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reynold the [Butler] was eating outdoors, despite the nip in the air. That was because eating indoors where he could get crumbs on the floors would get him in quite a bit of trouble with those assigned to cleaning. Right now he was enjoying a skewer of meat, still steaming in the cold air.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a very Human dish, but the people of Izril had adopted the foods of other species. This was a favorite food of Drakes, and it had spread across the continent. The kebab could have used some vegetables for flavoring, but Reynold had been late to lunch and only managed to snag one of the extras.</p>
<p>Still, the meat was hot, juicy, and Reynold was content to eat as he stood against one wall in the mansion. He was happy in life. That was, until he spotted the blue patch of indistinct light coming towards his face at speed.</p>
<p>Reynold ducked as the Frost Faerie flew past his head. But it wasn’t him that the faerie was after. He felt a tugging at the skewer in his hand and to his dismay, saw two chunks of meat disappear upwards into the air. Reynold watched in silent misery as the faerie began to devour a good bit of his meal.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe! Damn it, I told you not to steal food from people! Or at least don’t make it obvious when you’re doing it!”</p>
<p>An angry voice rang out in the small courtyard. Reynold sighed. So much for enjoying his lunch in peace. He turned and put on a polite smile as his profession dictated.</p>
<p>“Good evening Miss Ryoka. I trust this day sees you well?”</p>
<p>“Hey Reynold.”</p>
<p>The tall young women jogged over, pausing to stop in front of Reynold. She glared at the orb of blue light Reynold thought of as a Frost Faerie, a force of nature rather than an actual being. But Ryoka could apparently see such creatures, and talk to them. Reynold had spotted this particular faerie indoors, and he had been flabbergasted to see the true identity of these beings.</p>
<p>That still didn’t make him any less wary of them, though. Reynold eyed the fuzzy patch of light as it swooped closer to his meal. He would have given it up rather than risk the faerie’s wrath, but Ryoka swiped at the Frost Faerie, making it dodge away.</p>
<p>“Stop that. Leave the poor man to his meal. I’ll buy you something to eat when we get to Invrisil, okay?”</p>
<p>“Ah, so you are planning on visiting the city today?”</p>
<p>Reynold straightened up as the faerie flew back towards Ryoka. She nodded towards him, distracted. She stared at the faerie and scowled.</p>
<p>“What? Why do I…? He can’t even see you properly, why the hell should—okay, fine, fine. Shut up.”</p>
<p>She turned back towards him with a resigned look on her face. Ryoka pointed towards the hovering faerie’s indistinct form.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe is here. She wants to be acknowledged.”</p>
<p>“Of course. My deepest apologies, Miss Ivolethe.”</p>
<p>Reynold bowed in the direction of the faerie, according her the respect and proper tilt of the back due to a member of an aristocratic house. He couldn’t hear her of course, but Reynold got the impression the faerie was pleased.</p>
<p>“Glad you enjoyed that. Okay Reynold, I’m ready to go. One or two questions before we go, though. You said you brought all of the artifacts to an [Enchanter]. Any word on whether it’s done?”</p>
<p>“The estate has not received any communications to that effect, Miss. However, I am sure you could visit the mage in person to ask.”</p>
<p>“I might do that. Okay, next question. Are your orders to show me around the city, or can I only count on you for the ride back?”</p>
<p>Reynold answered carefully, remembering all the things Ressa had told him to say—and not to say.</p>
<p>“I am at your disposal, Miss Ryoka. I will accompany you as long as is needed—within Invrisil. I am not permitted to escort you anywhere outside of the city and my help is limited to an, ah, advisory role.”</p>
<p>“Meaning you don’t step in if I’m in trouble?”</p>
<p>Reynold winced.</p>
<p>“That is broadly correct, Miss.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s fine. Okay, last question.”</p>
<p>Ryoka stepped forwards and was suddenly uncomfortably close to Reynold. She narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>“Where are the others? The other people from my world.”</p>
<p>The unfortunate [Butler] swallowed.</p>
<p>“I don’t—”</p>
<p>“Don’t lie to me. I know they were here. Erin told me. Where did they go?”</p>
<p>The man let the silence go on till the count of five. That seemed like enough time—Ressa had told him to pretend to be reluctant to tell Ryoka.</p>
<p>“They…are learning to become adventurers, Miss. I believe they have been escorted southeast of here to—to train.”</p>
<p>“Train? You mean Magnolia’s hauling a bunch of kids to—damn, that sounds just like her. Are they going to get killed?”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe so, Miss. They have competent escorts.”</p>
<p>“But knowing Magnolia, they won’t step in unless someone’s about to die.”</p>
<p>Ryoka shook her head. She eyed Reynold and he wondered if she was going to ask him where they were—that was something he couldn’t reveal. To his relief, she seemed to abandon the idea.</p>
<p>“I don’t need to see them anyways. The city’s what I’m concerned about. Why don’t we head over there?”</p>
<p>He nodded, relieved.</p>
<p>“I will have the carriage prepped and ready to go within five minutes, Miss. If you will follow me?”</p>
<p>“I don’t need a carriage. I’ll run to the city and meet you inside. At the Runner’s Guild, say.”</p>
<p>The [Butler] hesitated.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure that would be the most efficacious use of time, Miss Ryoka.”</p>
<p>She stared at him.</p>
<p>“First, stop calling me Miss Ryoka. I’ve told you that. I don’t care what your [Butler] protocol says. Second, <em>why</em> would that take a long time?”</p>
<p>“The [Guardsmen] at the gates do a thorough check of all visitors entering the city, Mi—ah, Ryoka. The queue moves fairly quickly, but it would be easier to take Lady Reinhart’s carriage. Her servants and associates are never stopped on their errands.”</p>
<p>“The privilege of power, huh?”</p>
<p>Ryoka snorted and shook her head.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter how long the line is, Reynold. I’m a Runner. I skip the waiting around at the gates.”</p>
<p>“Not in Invrisil. Customs apply to all people entering, even Runners. There is a separate line, but…”</p>
<p>“What, they check Runners too? Why? Don’t tell me they’re at odds with their Runner’s Guild.”</p>
<p>“Not as such. But Invrisil sees far more magical artifacts and potentially dangerous items entering and leaving the city than most locations. Prudence is necessary.”</p>
<p>“They really get that many deliveries that could be dangerous? What about the Runner’s claim to confidentiality? Don’t tell me they’d open all of my packages.”</p>
<p>“I believe they have spells for that. As for the rest, well, Invrisil is slightly…larger than you might be used to, Ryoka.”</p>
<p>Reynold smiled slightly and stroked his trim mustache to hide it. Ryoka gave him an arch look while Ivolethe flew around her head.</p>
<p>“We’ll see. Let’s take the carriage, then.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Invrisil, the city of adventurers. It was one of the features of Izril, a place that would appear on any map of the world. Ryoka and Erin had both heard the city’s name during their stay in this world. It was a place of adventurers, the heart of the northern half of the continent, where Humans would come to find the strongest of adventurers, undertake the most dangerous of requests. And of course, visit one of the most prosperous cities on the continent.</p>
<p>After all, where adventurers thrived, there had to be a city of equal size and resources to support them. Inns and food to feed countless mouths, [Mages], [Alchemists], and [Blacksmiths] to supply warriors with any number of aids in battle, and [Merchants] to buy and sell goods looted, [Guardsmen] to break up fights between rival parties, brothels, gambling pubs, enchanters and healers, trackers and cartographers, bards and laborers…</p>
<p>It was a city to rival any modern city from Ryoka and Erin’s world. If the buildings weren’t as tall as skyscrapers, well, many of them were far higher than normal architecture would allow thanks to magically reinforced walls. And if there were no cars or planes, there were enough carriages, coaches, wagons, and carts to make up for that.</p>
<p>But the rest was the same. In fact, the rest was even more than Ryoka had seen in places like New York City. For while that city could boast over eight million souls, each one was Human. Not so in Invrisil.</p>
<p>String People walked down the street, chatting, poking at loose threads in each other’s bodies right next to Drakes, who strode around, keeping their tails from being trodden on by impatient Minotaurs who towered even over the heads of the Gnolls in the crowd. Humans dominated the scene, but they walked cheek-by-dead flesh with Selphids, did business with Drowned Men and Women, and argued hotly with bird-people, coughed as dusty travelers whose bodies seemed part sand walked past them—</p>
<p>Ryoka stared as the carriage drove down the streets, making good time despite the huge amount of people. Ivolethe, sitting on Ryoka’s head, stared around in delight, laughing and pointing at individuals in the crowd. But Ryoka couldn’t focus on any one thing.</p>
<p>The buildings! Some were made of wood and stone yes, but many had colored roofs in every shade, and still more had been painted or given artistic fronts. When magic could easily make any relief permanent, the most prosperous buildings paid for [Painters] and [Muralists] to create wondrous images. Ryoka saw a group of adventurers battling a hideously large Troll adorning three buildings, each one showing part of the complete relief. Then her eyes turned and saw the lights.</p>
<p>There was no electricity in this world. But who needed that when magic provided an even steadier, softer glow? The hanging orbs of crystal shone even in the day, and some had been enchanted to shift color steadily, to catch and bewitch the eye.</p>
<p>“See the guards on patrol, Miss Ryoka? They’re fine warriors, all of them. As fine as you’d see in any Drake city! Some of them are retired adventurers, and but for a few old wounds they’re as dangerous as they were in their youth.”</p>
<p>Reynold pointed out a group of men and women marching smartly down the street. They certainly did look older than normal, but Ryoka saw the confident way each one walked. She saw them pass by as the carriage moved onwards.</p>
<p>That was another thing. The city had a street and sidewalk. There were no wagons mixing with pedestrians here—there was a separate route for vehicles such that they could keep moving despite the flow of foot-traffic. Ryoka saw a [Guardswoman] directing traffic and wondered if there were street lights too. That would be too surreal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I smell goat meat! And cow meat! And rat meat! And spices! Thyme and rosemary and paprika and qerix and bablyous!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe shouted and leapt from Ryoka’s head. She skimmed to an open stall and laughed as the vendor swore and tried to protect his wares on display. Ryoka passed by one of the open markets in the city and saw countless stalls like the ones in Liscor, all open, all filled with [Merchants] and [Traders] doing business with people there.</p>
<p>“How many people live here?”</p>
<p>She shouted at Reynold as he drove the carriage up a street. He had to raise his voice to reply.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t say how many, Miss! This city is so vast—and there are countless towns and villages only a stone’s throw away!”</p>
<p>It couldn’t be a million. Ryoka was sure…but well, why not? She knew cities like Paris and London had boasted over a hundred thousand people in the middle ages. This city was surely as large—no, larger than they were. If you counted the suburbs and outskirts, why not?</p>
<p>“Unbelievable.”</p>
<p>She whispered the words as the carriage rode on. Now Reynold was taking her into the heart of the business district, as far as she could tell. Shops passed by on the right and left and she heard people calling out to her as she passed.</p>
<p>“Milady, a moment, please! Would you be interested in the latest wares from Baleros? A shipment has come in from T’vault, please see!”</p>
<p>“I have the latest treats from Terandria, right here! Try our fabulous new treat, a frozen delight! You won’t be able to say no to another lick!”</p>
<p>The man was talking about ice cream! Ryoka saw it being served in a shop—the man there was putting it on little gold platters for people to sample. She looked over to the other side of the street and saw a huge plaza pass by. The people shouting there seemed to be aiming for warriors, judging by the calls.</p>
<p>“Want a Shield Spider? Invaluable protection—don’t fear it turning on you! An expert [Beast Master] has trained it to fight and obey your every command!”</p>
<p>“Our group is seeking work! A [Jarl] and [Raiders] are willing to fight at your command!”</p>
<p>“I have a pot of Everburning Flame here! Make me an offer, quickly!”</p>
<p>“The Windfrozen Riders are available for commission—”</p>
<p>“Hire the Celestial Trackers and we will find your quarry or your coin back—”</p>
<p>The voices were swept away as Ryoka passed by. She turned her head to look and spoke to Ivolethe.</p>
<p>“I might have to get an Everburning Flame while I’m here. It could be seriously useful, especially if I can build a primitive steam engine or something. Hell, I could probably find a [Blacksmith] to make me the parts.”</p>
<p>The Frost Faerie laughed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Hah! Yon fool lies. That pot is filled with naught but oil. ‘Tis an alchemist’s trick—it will burn for a week before running out.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Damn. How can you tell?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“‘Twas not magic. And I caught the odor of the burnt oil as we passed. How could you <em>not</em> tell?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka stared at Ivolethe, impressed.</p>
<p>“I’m going to take you when I go shopping.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“After you buy me meat! You promised!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I need to take care of business first. Reynold, where’s the Runner’s Guild in the city?”</p>
<p>“We’re arriving at the largest branch now, Miss Ryoka.”</p>
<p>Reynold pointed, and Ryoka saw a large building to one side. It was painted like most of the buildings in the city—a light blue color, and she saw there were three sets of doors that were constantly in use as citizens came in to claim a package or have one delivered, and Runners went out to make said deliveries.</p>
<p>“Looks like that’s my stop. Should I wait for you there?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I will have to park this carriage at a spot designated for Lady Reinhart’s vehicles. Please do not wait for me. Instead, if you will accept this seal, I will locate you.”</p>
<p>Reynold produced one of Lady Magnolia’s iconic seals, half-gem, half-silver. Ryoka eyed the translucent sapphire melted together with shining silver metal into a single disc.</p>
<p>“Expensive. Are you sure I need it?”</p>
<p>“It will allow you unfettered access to many establishments, I think you will find, Miss Ryoka. Of course, Lady Reinhart asks that you not make any claims against her name with her token—lending it to you is an act of great trust.”</p>
<p>“And it has a tracking spell, doesn’t it? That’s how you’re going to find me.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss. This is most convenient in such a large city.”</p>
<p>Ryoka sighed, but took the token reluctantly.</p>
<p>“Find me as soon as you can and we’ll go visit that enchanter.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Ryoka.”</p>
<p>“And stop calling me Miss!”</p>
<p>Ryoka shouted as she leapt out of the carriage and Reynold drove off. She sighed as Ivolethe flew down and landed on her shoulder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Are ye going to take long in yon building?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Not too long if I can get past the receptionists without too much fuss. But they’ll have to tally all the deliveries I’ve got…look, just get inside my pouch and wait, alright?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Ach, the things that friendship requires.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grumbling, Ivolethe flew into Ryoka’s pouch. The Runner adjusted her belt, and then strode into the Runner’s Guild.</p>
<p>Whatever she had been expecting, Ryoka hadn’t quite expected the scope of this Guild. She stared around for a second, blinking, as her eyes took in the main Runner’s Guild of Invrisil.</p>
<p>“Wow. That’s a lot of Runners.”</p>
<p>There had to be over a hundred people in the building. That was three times as many as Ryoka had ever seen in Celum’s guild at any one time, and this was only the main building? She saw Runners coming and going, people of all species. A Gnoll with a package tied to a sling around her chest brushed past her, and Ryoka realized there was a steady stream going in and out the doors.</p>
<p>Quickly, the young woman stepped towards the receptionists. There were quite a few of them, and they were dealing with Runners quickly, changing seals for coin, handing out deliveries, and so on. Ryoka stepped into line and found herself advancing in the queue at startling speed.</p>
<p>There was no waiting long in a Runner’s Guild it seemed. Ryoka could already see the brisk [Receptionists] talking with Runners at the front. They seemed older than the normal group of young women, and there were men in the mix as well.</p>
<p>Ryoka fidgeted as she reached for her Runner’s Seal and bag of holding carrying all the deliveries from Remendia. She still hated talking to new people, especially when it came to Receptionists. They were so chatty—</p>
<p>“Next! Over here, Miss.”</p>
<p>Two receptionists finished with their Runner at the same time. Ryoka walked over to a woman in her mid-thirties. She was a String Person, although interestingly, she had pale skin, rather than Octavia or Revi’s dark tone. She held out one hand where all the fingers had stitches where they met the hand.</p>
<p>“Your seal, please.”</p>
<p>Ryoka placed her personal Runner’s seal on the counter. The [Receptionist] snatched it up and produced a magnifying glass to study it in an instant. She only gave it a brief look before sliding it back towards Ryoka.</p>
<p>“Ryoka Griffin? You’re a long way from Celum. Are you transferring, or doing a delivery? We didn’t receive word you were heading this way.”</p>
<p>Ryoka blinked. This receptionist was far more business-like than Ryoka was accustomed to. She hesitated a bit on her reply.</p>
<p>“I’m not transferring. I—was in Remendia and had the chance to come here. I’ve got a bunch of deliveries from the guild there.”</p>
<p>“Really? May I see them?”</p>
<p>Ryoka produced her bag of holding. The [Receptionist]’s gaze sharpened and she held out a hand.</p>
<p>“Wait. Are any of the packages marked confidential or otherwise uniquely addressed in any way?”</p>
<p>“Not that I was told.”</p>
<p>“Very well then. Proceed.”</p>
<p>Ryoka carefully took wrapped item after item out of the bag of holding, piling it up on the desk. In the end the receptionist had to call for a bin—she began transferring each package into it with quite deliberate movements.</p>
<p>“Well, that accounts for every package we had coming this way. I suppose we’ll get less on the weekly delivery.”</p>
<p>The [Receptionist] idly commented as she peered at the bin full of deliveries. Ryoka had to smile a bit; she could see some of the other Runners staring jealously at her. The [Receptionist] nodded as she tallied up each delivery on a receipt and stamped it.</p>
<p>“Not bad. But a Courier could have done it just as quickly, or faster if they were heading here directly. If you’re going to make a long-distance trip in the future, please inform the Guild so they can send a message, Miss.”</p>
<p>The smug smile on Ryoka’s face vanished. The woman at the desk looked only vaguely impressed with Ryoka’s feat. She handed the receipt to Ryoka.</p>
<p>“You may exchange that for coin now or at any guild, as I’m sure you know. Now, was there anything else, Miss?”</p>
<p>Caught off-guard, Ryoka thought quickly.</p>
<p>“…There is one thing. Do you happen to know if the Courier Valceif Godfrey is in the city?”</p>
<p>The woman at the desk raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Valceif? His usual circuit is closer to First Landing, but he comes here regularly for deliveries…I haven’t seen him of late, which is unusual, but I will ask about his location. If you return here later, I, or another receptionist at the desk will know more.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>“My pleasure, Miss Griffin. Next!”</p>
<p>Bemused, Ryoka wandered away from the desk, seeing a rather battered-looking Dullahan step forwards. She heard him beginning to complain about being attacked by dogs <em>again</em> before she stepped out of the guild.</p>
<p>“I guess a big city means the Runners here are that much better.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Bah, ‘tis not as if they can run that fast.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe poked her head out of Ryoka’s belt pouch as the young woman stood in the street. Ryoka shook her head; she thought the Runners in that building might all be at Fals’ level, or better. If that was the case, they were all nearly as fast or faster than she was.</p>
<p>“I’m starting to really feel like a country yokel seeing the city for the first time. Until Reynold finds us, how about we go look around? You can get something to eat, and I’ll…take in the sights, I guess.”</p>
<p>Ivolethe happily agreed, and so Ryoka set off down the streets. At first she was uncomfortable, but she quickly got used to the flow of the city.</p>
<p>This place reminded her a lot of New York. There wasn’t any stopping and chatting here, not with such a press of people. If you didn’t walk fast you got dirty looks—or pushed. The sidewalk was crowded, and when the wagons on the street halted to let pedestrians cross you moved fast or you got shouted at.</p>
<p>Ryoka had the insane urge to shout ‘I’m walking here!’ just for the hell of it. But that would probably get something hurled at her head by one of the drivers. They certainly traded insults with the foot traffic in a refreshingly familiar way. Although, Ryoka had to admit, she had never seen a pedestrian throw a ball of magic at a driver who shouted obscenities at him.</p>
<p>But aside from the city press, the city of Invrisil was still a city. And Ryoka had grown up in the urban sprawl. There were places to get food on the sidewalk, and in no time she was eating her own hot skewer and quickly sliding off hot chunks of meat to cram into her belt pouch from another.</p>
<p>Her pouch was going to get greasy and disgusting, but Ivolethe seemed only concerned about the food. Ryoka could feel her rustling around and making happy noises as she ate. And a happy Frost Faerie was one that wasn’t freezing your stomach and giving you horrible bowel movements.</p>
<p>“Where to next, I wonder?”</p>
<p>Ryoka stopped in a busy plaza, looking around for signs, perhaps to the market, or maybe to a specialized store specializing in magical artifacts. She had coin after all—a lot of it. It might not be enough for a powerful magical artifact, but it was time to buy a ring or—or enchanted clothing perhaps. What about a wand—</p>
<p>“Watch where you’re going, Troll!”</p>
<p>An outraged shout made Ryoka’s head turn. She saw a group of armored men and one woman—adventurers?—standing in front of…</p>
<p>Ryoka had to rub her eyes. It was a Troll. Or—no, not a Troll maybe, but a half-Troll?</p>
<p>There was no other word for it. Ryoka hadn’t seen a Troll before, but she imagined they’d be a bit bigger, a bit rounder and more…monster-like. But while this…person wasn’t a full Troll, they definitely had some Troll blood in them.</p>
<p>It was hard to describe. Ryoka’s first impression was that someone had taken this poor young woman—a young woman with far bigger bones than even Garia—and painted her a greyish color. But that alone wouldn’t account for her tough, almost pebble-like skin and towering height. She was over seven feet tall and she looked like a goliath. Not like a tall and lanky basketball player, no, Ryoka thought she looked more like a walking tank. Broad-shouldered didn’t even begin to cover it, and her arms were <em>thick.</em></p>
<p>She was wearing rough, simple clothing that looked hand-stitched. The half-Troll was trying to step away from the angry adventurer she’d apparently run into. He wasn’t letting her go. He was angry, and, Ryoka thought, overly hostile towards her.</p>
<p>“Of course. Racism at its finest.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“What is?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe poked her head out of Ryoka’s pouch, cheeks bulging. The second she saw the scene she went still. Ryoka shook her head as the adventurer began insulting the half-Troll girl.</p>
<p>He looked like he wanted a fight. Briefly, Ryoka considered stepping in. She had no patience for bullies. And she had a pepper potion and the other items Octavia had given her ready to be used. Except that this adventurer had a group of his friends backing him up. Ryoka eyed them and shook her head.</p>
<p>“Not my business.”</p>
<p>That was what Ryoka decided in the end. She could imagine what would happen if she picked a fight with real adventurers. She’d not only lose, but probably get hurt and maybe get thrown in jail. It wasn’t worth it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Don’t go! Stay! I want to watch!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe shouted as Ryoka turned to leave. The young woman frowned down into the pouch.</p>
<p>“Why? Do you want to help? I won’t stop you, but be careful. If they think that half-Troll girl is doing it, they’ll attack her.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“What? Not the half-child, ye daft fool! I want to see what <em>he </em>does!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe pointed, and Ryoka saw to her surprise that the Troll girl wasn’t in fact alone. She hadn’t even seen the young man standing by her side; she sort of dominated the scene. But he was standing in silence, listening to the adventurer get angrier and angrier.</p>
<p>The adventurer was <em>trying</em> to pick a fight, Ryoka could tell. He had a sword and this half-Troll didn’t. He was a piece of crap, and she would have loved to drop-kick him and stomp on him a bit. But she had a feeling he’d kick her ass if she tried.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to stay and watch this unfold. And yet, she watched the adventurer continue to pick on the half-Troll with narrowed eyes, unable to just walk away.</p>
<p>“Enough. Please stop bothering my companion.”</p>
<p>The young man spoke up at last. He seemed to be talking to the entire group, rather than the belligerent adventurer in front.</p>
<p>“She did nothing wrong. If she walked into you while escorting me, I apologize on both our behalf. But you have no reason to attack her like this.”</p>
<p>The other members of the group seemed to accept this, but the man who’d been knocked into seemed to find this apology too weak, or perhaps he just wanted to cause more trouble for the pair. He swaggered up to the young man, glaring.</p>
<p>“Is she your bodyguard? In that case, you should apologize to us directly! Don’t you know who we are?”</p>
<p>The young man turned his head towards the adventurer, and Ryoka blinked as she saw his eyes were closed.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, or particularly care. Please move aside—we are trying to go about our business and you should do the same.”</p>
<p>“What, are you too good to look me in the eye?”</p>
<p>Outraged, the adventurer seized the young man’s arm. Immediately the half-Troll reacted. She reached for the adventurer to push him back. He immediately leapt back and his friends grabbed for their weapons. Protectively, the Troll girl moved in front of the young man.</p>
<p>“Don’t do that! He’s blind!”</p>
<p>A blind guy? Ryoka had seen few people with disabilities in this world. She wondered if that was because of a lack of pollution or other genetic factors—or if such people died out because they couldn’t defend themselves or contribute.</p>
<p>Either way, the young man’s lack of sight didn’t stop him from being a target. The adventurer began mocking both him and the half-Troll girl, much to Ryoka’s distaste.</p>
<p>“A blind man and a half-Troll! Hah! I suppose that’s the only person who’d put up with something like that!”</p>
<p>The gigantic young woman glared at the adventurer.</p>
<p>“Go away. If you bother Laken, I’ll protect him. I’m his—”</p>
<p>She got no further, because the man interrupted her with a sneer.</p>
<p>“Protect him? You couldn’t protect a fly! I’ve seen real combat, not like some half-monster country bumpkin.”</p>
<p>The half-Troll said nothing, but there was an unfriendly look in her eye, and one of her hands clenched into a fist. A <em>big</em> fist. Ryoka eyed it and wondered what would happen if she hit the adventurer with it. His buddies looked a bit worried, but the man in front was drunk on bravado.</p>
<p>“Do you know how many Trolls I’ve killed with this sword? I could etch another notch right here, and no one would care.”</p>
<p>The man put a hand on his sword as he stepped forwards. The half-Troll girl flinched, but then to Ryoka’s surprise the young man moved. He took a step forwards and turned his head towards the adventurer. He was clearly angry, and when his mouth opened the word he spoke <em>echoed</em> across the square.</p>
<p>“<strong>Enough.</strong>”</p>
<p>Ryoka felt something <em>press</em> at her chest and had to force herself not to react. The adventurer stumbled back as if something physical had hit him. He put his hands on his sword with a snarl and the half-Troll girl raised a threatening fist. Before the conflict could escalate into bloodshed, Ryoka heard a shout and thumping of boots.</p>
<p>“What’s going on here!?”</p>
<p>The Watch had come, and remarkably quickly too. Ryoka wondered if it had to do with the half-Troll being there—and then corrected her thought. Of course it did. She watched as the two sides explained what had happened from their point of view.</p>
<p>Predictably, the adventurer claimed that the half-Troll had nearly knocked him down and he had simply reacted to the provocation. The blind young man and the half-Troll claimed the opposite. The young man—he was named Laken apparently—was explaining things to the Lieutenant, who didn’t seem too inclined to listen to his side of the case.</p>
<p>“She did nothing wrong. Durene was guiding me through the streets when this man decided to take objection to her existing.”</p>
<p>“So you say, sir. But this adventurer and his friends—a Silver-rank team—claim otherwise.”</p>
<p>The young man’s brows drew together as he snapped.</p>
<p>“I may be blind, but I know what I heard. And other people saw what happened too. Why not ask them? Or better yet, use a truth spell?”</p>
<p>“I hardly think that this situation calls for that.”</p>
<p>The man in charge dismissed the idea as if it were silly. He glanced at the adventurer, who looked pretty damn confident for someone who was probably lying, in Ryoka’s opinion. The lieutenant glared up at the half-Troll, who was looking chastened as well as upset.</p>
<p>“I’ll let it go with a warning—for both of you. Be on your way sir, and you, Miss—”</p>
<p>He hesitated, made a face, and then went on.</p>
<p>“—Cause no problems in my city while you’re here. If I hear of any more disturbances, there will be trouble.”</p>
<p>The adventurer took that as his cue to go and swaggered off. Ryoka glared at his back, but the young blind man was still irate.</p>
<p>“You have got to be kidding me. Is this really fair, officer? You and I both know that Durene did nothing wrong. Is it because she’s a half-Troll that you’re blaming her? Or do you simply not care about justice?”</p>
<p>The lieutenant did not like being told off. His cheeks reddened and he put a hand on his sword until he realized the blind man couldn’t see the motion.</p>
<p>“I apologize if you’ve been inconvenienced sir. Now, move along.”</p>
<p>“Come on Laken, let’s go.”</p>
<p>The half-Troll pulled gently at the young man’s shoulder. He clenched his fists, and then relaxed his hands. His fury seemed to wash away in an instant and he looked resigned, rather than upset. Laken nodded and patted Durene’s hand.</p>
<p>“Very well, I suppose this guardsman is just doing his job. As we say in my homeland, <em>fahr zur Hölle du Bullenschwein. Ah entschuldigung, SIE Bullenschwein.</em> Good day, officer.”</p>
<p>The blind man spoke the words directly to the lieutenant, and then smiled at him as if what he’d said had been a compliment. It clearly wasn’t, but no one knew what he’d said. The lieutenant frowned, but didn’t make an issue of it.</p>
<p>But standing across the street, Ryoka Griffin’s eyes suddenly went wide. She felt as if her entire body had suddenly been shocked. She knew what had been said. But more importantly, she knew in what language that had been said. That was no foreign tongue from this world. That was <em>German!</em></p>
<p>Ryoka’s heart beat rapidly in her chest as she saw the group of guardsmen stride away, leaving the duo behind. That had to be just a coincidence. Or was it? There weren’t any people who spoke German in this world, were there? Well, if everyone here spoke English, why not? Another country could have adopted other languages. And yet—Ryoka’s gaze fixed on the blind young man standing next to the upset half-Troll.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe. Why is that guy so special?”</p>
<p>The faerie’s voice was tiny in Ryoka’s ear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I see it on him. The mark of command. The old destiny of leaders.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That made no sense to Ryoka. But she was distracted by the Troll-girl. Durene? She was bending and whispering to the young man, although her voice was quite audible to anyone listening. Ryoka glanced around. Not many people were. They were hurrying around and away from her, rather than stopping to listen.</p>
<p>“What did you say, Laken?”</p>
<p>He turned his head towards her and Ryoka saw him smile. She heard him clearly whisper to the half-Troll as she stepped closer.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you later, Durene. Let’s just get to that Runner’s Guild first, hm? We can see about adventurers later.”</p>
<p>Hesitantly, the half-Troll took the young man’s hand. She cast around, and then began to set off through the street, easily clearing a path for him to walk by her. Ryoka hesitated.</p>
<p>She could ignore that and go to the enchanter. She couldn’t believe she’d find someone else from her world right here, just like that.</p>
<p>And yet—Ryoka glanced down at her belt pouch. Ivolethe had poked her head out, and she was chewing the last bit of meat. And her eyes were fixed on Laken. The Frost Faerie glanced up at Ryoka, and then away.</p>
<p>Coincidence? Or fate? Was she being led, or was this all some huge chance event? Ryoka didn’t know. But as the half-Troll and blind young man walked through the crowds, Ryoka slowly walked after them.</p>

		<p><strong>Day 49</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>My name is Laken Godart. I am blind. Also, I’m trapped in another world where reality seems to conform to the rules of some kind of game.</p>
<p>I could be a victim of some kind of elaborate prank or test, or a social experiment. I could see myself being an easy target for some kind of shady government project—if of course I’m not just crazy.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m not ruling out any options. The reason why I ended up in this world could be anything as simple as an alien abduction gone wrong to genuine magic. I’m leaning on the magic side, myself.</p>
<p>This place is just too…real. Too real, and I want to believe in it. In the short month and a half since I’ve been here, I gained sight. Of a kind, yes, but sight nevertheless. I found someone I loved, and I found something to fight for.</p>
<p>But I won’t forget to think about what I do. I’m no hero with a sword. I’m fairly certain I’d hurt myself just trying to pick one up. I can’t be a warrior.</p>
<p>But I can be smart. I can choose what I want to do and pick my battles, if there are any in the future. I have friends. I have a class.</p>
<p>I am an [Emperor], and I have responsibilities. That, more than anything, informs how I act. Even now, I’ve travelled to this place, this city, for the people under my protection.</p>
<p>“It really is a big city, isn’t it, Durene?”</p>
<p>I say that out loud and feel Durene laughing nervously through our connected hands. I can tell she’s next to me. I may be blind, but I have my other senses. Here is what I know. I’m holding Durene’s hand. Her palm is callused—rough. Almost like a shark’s skin? I touched one once at an aquarium—a small, non-threatening shark or so I was told. Durene’s skin is somewhat like that.</p>
<p>Her hand is warm. On this cold, brisk day, her hand is warm. And I can hear her every step. But I can also hear the voices.</p>
<p>Oh—the voices. I’ve been in huge cities before, heard cars passing by, honking, shouting, but there’s just something about a mass of <em>people</em> that seems large to me. Maybe it’s because I know each person has to be out there, each one an individual moving and talking and thinking on their own.</p>
<p>A hundred voices. A thousand, some shouting, others just talking as they pass by me and Durene. More still simply walk, and it’s that movement which really tells me that I’m in a city.</p>
<p>I can smell—dirt and stone. And sweat, musty odors coming off of winter clothing probably. But more strongly through the air, baked food. Hot tangy scents wafting towards me and making me hungry. Someone’s cooking food over to the left, and the wind’s blowing it towards me. Not a meat—something else?</p>
<p>They’re not the only ones. There are more food vendors all about. Smell, hearing—I’m being overwhelmed on both fronts by the sheer input.</p>
<p>However, I am used to it. I know better than to panic, and it’s hardly like I’m incapable of moving about. I let Durene lead me through the city at a good pace. I just wish—</p>
<p>I wish I could <em>see </em>all of this. Sound and smell only get me so far. But from what Durene tells me, this city is like nothing in my past world.</p>
<p>“Lizard people? Really, Durene?”</p>
<p>“They’re called Drakes, I think. I’ve never seen one before. Um, I think they live far to the south of here.”</p>
<p>“Amazing. Drakes. Draco. Are they related to Dragons, by any chance?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know? They um, have scales. And long tails. Some of them have green scales, others have red or blue or—that one’s yellow.”</p>
<p>Durene moves as if to point and stops herself. I nod to myself as we walk on. I’m trying to imagine what these creatures—these people might be like. But I don’t think in terms of sight, naturally. I have a rough image in my head, but I would love to talk to one of these Drakes, shake their…hand?</p>
<p>“Do they have hands?”</p>
<p>“Something like that. It uh, it’s more like claws. They look sharp.”</p>
<p>Claw hands. I try to fit that in and reconsider shaking hands. But if I could touch one—</p>
<p>And how would I do that? I’m assuming these other species have the same taboos and social norms—at least broadly—that Humans do. Durene didn’t think it was too strange for a city to have Drakes in it, for all she’s never seen one.</p>
<p>Maybe if I got to know one. Naturally I can’t just stop someone on the street—well, I could, but I have more pressing matters.</p>
<p>I am in this city for a reason. I speak to Durene, feeling her guiding me left to avoid something or someone.</p>
<p>“Would you say we’re close to that plaza you saw now?”</p>
<p>“I think so!”</p>
<p>She sounds excited and worried by turns. Excited, and overwhelmed by her first glimpse of a city, as I suppose anyone would be. I have to remember Durene’s never even left her village. This must be overwhelming for her. I have to keep the cool head.</p>
<p>And yet, I can’t help but feel like Durene’s the one who’ll be most useful in a pinch. She proved that when she stood up to those adventurers. All I could do was raise my voice and be useless.</p>
<p>Those adventurers…I sigh as I walk with Durene towards the plaza.</p>
<p>Bastards. Ditto for that lieutenant. But the insight into this city was helpful. There’s corruption here, or at least, casual racism against one type of species. Ironic, that. I guess in a city with countless races joining hands—or claws—there has to be some group that gets pushed out.</p>
<p>I have to understand the world around me to interact with it. That’s why Durene and I have been walking through the city this last hour, taking it in, finding the measure of it. Better that than rush off and make mistakes. And it was a very pleasant walk too—Durene described so many odd sights for me. And yet, I guess you step in dog shit at least once on the best of strolls.</p>
<p>“Ah, I can hear the adventurers shouting now.”</p>
<p>Yes, in my ears I can now pick out a different set of shouts, this one growing louder as Durene and I walk forwards. Adventurers.</p>
<p>“…the Storm Raiders will sell our axes to anyone in need of a strong arm! Make us an offer!”</p>
<p>“—the best, the mightiest! Our shields will block spell and fang alike! The Ironshield Vanguard!”</p>
<p>“We’re a group of [Soldiers] who fought in the Yelten-Grimmor conflict! We’ve over fifty kills between us! You want protection, turn to us!”</p>
<p>Ah, adventurers. Durene leads me forwards, and I can just tell she’s stopping to stare around.</p>
<p>“Do you see Gamel around?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Durene sounds worried, although she shouldn’t be. I can feel her shift—is she standing on her tiptoes? I imagine she would be able to see practically everyone in the plaza. Even these ‘Gnolls’ don’t sound as tall as she is.</p>
<p>“I don’t see him, Laken. Should I call out, do you think? Or—”</p>
<p>I squeeze her hand gently, reassuring her.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Durene. It was just a thought. I imagine he’s off in some other square. We did say we’d meet at midday. Correct me if I’m wrong, but we’ve a little bit of time before then.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. You did say—okay.”</p>
<p>“Let’s take a seat—if one’s available. I could use a few seconds to rest, and I’d like to listen to what all these people are shouting. You can describe them for me.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>We make it a few more steps into the plaza, and then I feel Durene slow. She bends towards me and whispers something in my ear.</p>
<p>“Laken, I think that girl is still following us!”</p>
<p>I pause for only a microsecond, but then move forwards. Durene is stopped.</p>
<p>“I see. Keep walking, Durene. Don’t look back at her—or if you do, just glance past her, as if you haven’t seen her.”</p>
<p>“Okay, Laken. But what does she want?”</p>
<p>“You’re sure she’s following us and not going somewhere else?”</p>
<p>“I’m sure! We practically walked in a circle, and I keep seeing her!”</p>
<p>“Describe her for me again.”</p>
<p>Durene pauses. I can hear the nervousness in her voice when she speaks again.</p>
<p>“Um. Tall. Taller than you, Laken. A few inches taller? She’s…got black hair, darkish skin—I’ve never seen someone who looks like that. Is she a foreigner? Uh—she’s uh—beautiful.”</p>
<p>“Beautiful?”</p>
<p>It’s an alien word to me. Beautiful is a word I associate with a voice, not with faces or appearance. But Durene’s voice is filled with a longing that tells me all I need to know.</p>
<p>“She’s beautiful. Sort of scary-looking, but beautiful. And—she looks like a Runner.”</p>
<p>“Hm.”</p>
<p>Durene spotted the girl following us a few blocks back. She pointed her out to me—well, described her to me—as one of the oddities of the city. A foreigner, someone not native to this continent.</p>
<p>It’s a…hard thing for me to think of. I know there are ethnicities in my world, of course. Nationality, race, gender…that’s easy to understand. But skin color? I don’t know what the color blue is supposed to look like.</p>
<p>Apparently, the folk of Riverfarm and this continent look predominantly like the people of my home continent, Europe. That is to say, mostly fair-skinned. This girl isn’t. She could be black or Asian or Latino—Durene’s descriptions don’t help me think of her in that way. She’s just clearly a foreigner, and one who stands out in this multi-species environment. No—more so because she stands out among her own kind, Humans.</p>
<p>And she’s following us. What does that mean? I frown as Durene worries next to me.</p>
<p>“Let’s get to a seat, and you can tell me if she stays in the area. If she doesn’t—well, we’ll know then.”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>Durene’s palm is slightly sweaty in my hand. Or is it mine? Because I hate to imagine it, but this could be an issue.</p>
<p>Why would someone follow us? A thousand reasons come to mind. They might be a prejudiced asshole like the adventurers. Or they might be interested in Durene. Or maybe it’s something to do with me?</p>
<p>I’m in a gaming world. Is this just a random event? Is this a scripted NPC? I’m sure this isn’t that kind of game, but why else would someone follow us? Is she aware of Riverfarm’s plight? Is she simply curious about an interspecies couple?</p>
<p>I don’t know. But I think. That’s what I can do in this world. Think. Think, and try to understand. Who is this young woman? What does she want?</p>
<p>And what should I do about it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka Griffin gritted her teeth as she saw the half-Troll’s head turn. She slowed, but the tall girl’s head found her.</p>
<p>“She can’t have spotted me. She can’t.”</p>
<p>Ryoka muttered under her breath as the girl named Durene seemed to glance at her, and then hurriedly look past. It was the third time she’d done so in as many minutes. It made Ryoka worried.</p>
<p>And annoyed, because Ryoka really didn’t want to think she’d been spotted by a Troll. Half-Troll. Whatever. That would be embarrassing, and yet—</p>
<p>“She saw me. Damn, damn, <em>damn…</em>”</p>
<p>In writing, it sounded easy. Follow a blind guy being led around by a half-Troll. How hard could that be? It was probably wrong to think, but Ryoka had the impression that the half-Troll girl wasn’t exactly the fastest brick on the block. She seemed simple, somewhat timid, and gentle. A giant, in short, easy to follow without being seen while Ryoka listened to what the two were doing.</p>
<p>But the Troll—Durene was her name, wasn’t it?—kept looking around. Ryoka felt the half-Troll girl’s eyes pause on her again and tried to meld with a group of laughing Drakes. But the problem was that becoming one with the crowd only worked if the crowd was the same species as you were. And for all her varied interests over the years, Ryoka had never tried espionage. To be more accurate, she’d never tried following someone who kept pausing every few minutes to stare about.</p>
<p>In movies or in books, the protagonist following the suspect had the advantage of darkness, or an unaware target, or some convenient plot twist which would help them complete their mission. And at the very least, they could blend with the crowd.</p>
<p>But Ryoka stood out. She <em>knew</em> she stood out. She was an Asian girl who didn’t look like the other native Humans to this land, and certainly not like the other species. So she’d been spotted with disgusting ease. The blind guy couldn’t see her, but his helper could, and she kept staring around—probably to tell him what everything looked like!</p>
<p>That was one side of the problem. The Troll-girl saw Ryoka. She saw Ryoka, but Ryoka saw the man following the pair. That was someone the half-Troll hadn’t spotted.</p>
<p>And no wonder—he was completely bland. He had flaxen hair, a nondescript face—his clothes weren’t anything to blink twice over. And yet, he was following the blind man known as Laken and the half-Troll Durene as well, Ryoka was sure of it.</p>
<p>He was following them, and Ryoka wanted to know why. She kept eying the man as she walked into the plaza with all the adventurers lined up. They were an odd bunch. It looked as though each one had their space to, well, show off. Teams of adventurers—Silver-rank at best by the looks of them—were doing tricks with swords or just trying to give off a certain amount of swagger as their teammates or hired help extolled their virtues, trying to get them a job.</p>
<p>It was an odd way of doing things, but Ryoka supposed it was needed advertisement if you wanted a lucrative contract. In a place with so many adventurers—Ryoka saw one every block it seemed—people with requests could choose their team, which meant competition had to be fierce.</p>
<p>Now the human and half-Troll seemed to be stopping. They were headed for some unoccupied benches sitting in the shade of some trees in the plaza. Ryoka bit her lip.</p>
<p>She hadn’t gotten close enough to hear more than a few snippets of conversation and she’d already been made. Should she try to get close, knowing she was exposed?</p>
<p>It had just been a few words. In German. Just a few words—why couldn’t there be some nation based off of Germany, or some culture with Germanic roots? But Ryoka had to know.</p>
<p>So she walked closer. She looked around—where was that man in plain clothes? <em>He</em> was a master at being invisible. Ryoka would never have spotted him if she hadn’t noticed him following the pair like she was.</p>
<p><em>There.</em> He was strolling ahead of her, right next to the half-Troll. Ryoka’s eyes narrowed. She watched as he approached, and then cursed.</p>
<p>“Son of a—”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It happened in a moment as we were walking towards the bench that Durene had found. I, walking by her side, felt her pause for a second.</p>
<p>“Oh! I’m so sorry!”</p>
<p>“My fault, Miss. Please excuse me.”</p>
<p>An unfamiliar voice. Male. Pleasant. I frown and hear him walk away.</p>
<p>“What was that, Durene?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, Laken. I just bumped into that man.”</p>
<p>“Huh.”</p>
<p>Durene sounds at ease, but my frown remains. Something feels wrong. Bumped into her. Why does that…</p>
<p><em>Who would bump into someone as big as Durene? From what she’s said, she gets a lot of room even on a busy sidewalk. Who goes around bumping into people ordinarily, anyways? And the way he said it—</em></p>
<p>“Durene! Check your money pouch!”</p>
<p>I snap as thoughts come together in an instant. I’ve encountered thieves and pickpockets before. I know the scam. I hear Durene gasp and then her anguished shout.</p>
<p>“It’s gone! He took it!”</p>
<p>“Go after him!”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>“Go, Durene!”</p>
<p>I shout, letting go of her hands. That’s not just her money that was taken—Durene had the entire pouch of coin and gems I found by her cottage! If that thief runs off with it—</p>
<p>To her credit, I hear Durene hesitate only for a second. Then I feel her turn and run away from me. Then her voice.</p>
<p>“<em>Stop! Thief!</em>”</p>
<p>It’s a shout that drowns out all sound for a second. Durene has an impressive pair of lungs, and I can practically hear the thief’s heart stop as she runs towards him.</p>
<p>I stand in the plaza, not moving, fishing in the small rucksack I’m carrying for something. I pull out my foldable cane and extend it fully.</p>
<p>I haven’t had to use it in a while. I decided not to use it when Durene was walking me around—I trust her completely and it might have gotten in the way of all the pedestrians about. But it’s a useful tool now.</p>
<p>A quick check—I tap carefully in a circle around me and find the bench we were about to sit at. I move over to it and sit down.</p>
<p>It’s not as if I’m not panicking right now. A thief, taking all the money Durene and I have—the money meant for Riverfarm? That’s a disaster. But what can I do in this situation? Panic?</p>
<p>Durene’s chasing after the thief. Either she gets him or she doesn’t. I can only make things worse by shouting and running about. So I sit and try to think.</p>
<p>If she fails to get him—we have to talk to the Watch. But can we get our money back? It’s not like I had a credit card—that gold and those gems are probably as good as gone the instant they’re lost. And would the local law enforcement help us? The way they treated Durene—</p>
<p>I wrench my mind off of that train of thought. Consider the worst when it’s over. The real question is—why target Durene? Who steals from a half-Troll? I haven’t ever really laid eyes on Durene, it’s true, but a girl who towers over the biggest Human and who can probably bench press a horse is <em>not</em> someone I’d expect pickpockets to normally go after.</p>
<p>Unless that’s normal in this world. No—it can’t be. Did that cutpurse realize how much money she was carrying? Or—</p>
<p>“Damn. A Skill. It must be that.”</p>
<p>Why didn’t I think of it? It’s a reasonable explanation. If you assume there’s a class for everything, and that’s what Durene seems to believe, then there’s definitely a [Thief] class. And what better Skill than one that allows someone to pick out an easy mark? Or a rich one?</p>
<p>I clench one fist as I hear Durene’s shouting and the commotion growing more distant. Pray. Hope. And think about what to do if she doesn’t catch him—</p>
<p>“Excuse me. Is your name Laken?”</p>
<p>I start. A voice—a female voice comes from above and to my left. I turn my head.</p>
<p>“Hello. Pardon me, but have we met?”</p>
<p>“Not before. But tell me—<em>woher kommst du?</em>”</p>
<p>The pronunciation is terrible, and the words are stilted, spoken without fluency. But I stiffen nonetheless, because I know German when I hear it.</p>
<p>And I know that no one on this continent speaks German, as far as Durene or Gamel know.</p>
<p>So why is someone speaking it to me right now?</p>
<p>In the time it takes for me to clear my throat and respond, my thought process is simple. Who’s talking to me? It has to be the girl Durene spotted. Why?</p>
<p>Well, either she thinks I’m from her country or, more probably—</p>
<p>“<em>Aus San Francisco. Und Sie?</em>”</p>
<p>A sharp, indrawn breath is my only answer. But it’s the only one I need.</p>
<p>“<em>Dieu merci. </em>I am not alone.”</p>
<p>Can you feel shock, amazement, relief, and confusion all at once? I’m sure there is one, even if it’s not an English word. There are words in other languages for feelings that are never fully translatable into English.</p>
<p>The Norwegian word <em>forelsket</em> for instance—I feel that towards Durene every time I touch her. I suppose in lieu of a word now, I think I’ll go with ‘relief’ as incomplete as it may be.</p>
<p>“I am not alone.”</p>
<p>I feel tears spring into my eyes, gathering behind my eyelids. As strange as it may sound, I really did think I was alone up until this moment. Alone, in a new world.</p>
<p>But there’s someone else. I stand up, and hear someone take a step back. There’s noise all around us—has Durene caught the thief? I can’t focus on that. Suddenly, I’m in a small bubble with this girl.</p>
<p>“You’re—from home, aren’t you? Earth?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“My god. Excuse me, but who are you? I’m blind—are you the young woman who was following us around earlier?”</p>
<p>A pause. I listen, heart beating, before the young woman replies in a low voice.</p>
<p>“I am. I’m—a friend. My name is Ryoka Griffin. Tell me, when did you get here? Do you know why you came to this world? Who have you talked to—who’s that girl who was with you?”</p>
<p>The questions are like a storm, tersely delivered. I hear in them echoes of all the things I want to know.</p>
<p>“My name is Laken. Laken Godart. I came here a little over a month ago. I don’t know how or why—the girl’s name is Durene. She’s my guide, my friend. She found me when I first came to this world.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“Where is she, do you know? She ran off—”</p>
<p>“After the thief. I think she got him.”</p>
<p>“She did?”</p>
<p>I’m astonished, but there’s a flicker of amusement in Ryoka’s tone.</p>
<p>“Yeah. She picked him up and threw him on the ground. I think she broke some of his bones.”</p>
<p>“<em>Durene?</em>”</p>
<p>I can’t imagine it. Well, I can, but I can’t imagine <em>her</em> doing that. But this strange young woman seems focused. I hear her moving closer and resist the urge to reach out to try and touch her.</p>
<p>“Look, I don’t have a lot of time before your friend gets back.”</p>
<p>“Why would that—”</p>
<p>“Do you have a cellphone? Flashlight? Anything—anything from our world?”</p>
<p>The question catches me by surprise, but then I fumble at my pocket, and then remember and grab for my rucksack.</p>
<p>“I do. I have an iPhone—it’s practically out of battery, and there’s no signal obviously, but—”</p>
<p>“You can recharge it.”</p>
<p>“<em>Really?</em>”</p>
<p>“If a mage casts a [Repair] spell it’ll go back to full charge. Okay, listen. Did you get a call—no, you wouldn’t have if you were only here for two months…huh…”</p>
<p>I can tell she’s thinking hard about something. Myself, I’m just astonished. Mage? [Repair] spell? You mean I can charge up my phone in this world with magic? What possibilities might that unlock?</p>
<p>Then I hear Ryoka’s voice in my ears and jerk away. She’s so <em>close!</em> And she’s whispering, very urgently.</p>
<p>“Listen up. You’re not entirely safe with that iPhone. You might be tracked with it—there are people in this world who know we come from another one. If you get a call on your phone, don’t answer it. There are more of us in this world, but—”</p>
<p>“Hold on, hold on! More of us?”</p>
<p>I can’t process everything that she’s saying. Ryoka shakes her head—I know because her hair hits my face slightly as her head moves.</p>
<p>“I can’t give you the full details, not yet. Look, we need to talk. Why don’t we meet up later? I have something to do now, but I can meet you here in—an hour. Can you wait until then?”</p>
<p>My head is spinning, but I nod.</p>
<p>“I can. I’ll be here.”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>She’s gone before I can give voice to the questions in my mind. At least, I think she’s gone. I tap around cautiously with my cane—she could be just out of range and I’d never know.</p>
<p>What was that? I sit back down on the bench; my knees are shaking. Before I can collect my thoughts, I hear a voice speaking to me again.</p>
<p>“Sir? Are you the friend of Miss Durene?”</p>
<p>For a second I think Ryoka has come back. But it’s not her—the speaker is different. There’s a bit of a growl to her tone that makes me think of a dog. And worry. Dogs scare me. I’ve been bitten three times while walking—I can’t tell where they are until I run into one, and if the owner’s not got a leash or isn’t attentive, some of them take objection to my presence.</p>
<p>But this is no dog. It must be a Gnoll! I stand up, turning my head in the direction of the speaker.</p>
<p>“Can I help you…Miss?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. My name is Raisha, and I am a [Guardswoman] on duty. I am told you are blind. Well, I would like you to know that I have recovered your lost belongings.”</p>
<p>“I got it, Laken!”</p>
<p>Durene calls out and I realize she’s standing with Raisha. I smile.</p>
<p>“You caught the thief?”</p>
<p>“Yes, your friend broke his arm and several ribs.”</p>
<p>An amused tone enters Raisha’s growling voice. She touches something which makes a metallic noise.</p>
<p>“He has been arrested and will be charged. However, I would like to confirm that this bag—”</p>
<p>She hefts something metallic with a strained grunt.</p>
<p>“—is yours. Is this so?”</p>
<p>I’m confused and say so.</p>
<p>“It is—but Durene, you were carrying it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but…well, it <em>is</em> yours, Laken!”</p>
<p>That’s true, but I have to shake my head over Durene’s semantics. Raisha, the Gnoll [Guardswoman] doesn’t seem to care who owns what.</p>
<p>“I don’t need to know who was carrying what. The issue is simple, sir. I just need to prove that you are the owner.”</p>
<p>“How?”<br>
Now I’m worried. It’s not as if I could prove anything. Raisha opens something with a <em>snap</em> and rummages around in some sort of purse.</p>
<p>“I have here a gem enchanted with a spell of [Detect Truth], sir. It will tell if you are indeed the owner of the stolen goods. Will you comply with this test?”</p>
<p>“Truth spell? Well—certainly. What do I need to do?”</p>
<p>“Place your hand out, palm up. Good—”</p>
<p>I feel something small and hard drop into my palm. It’s cold and I jump a bit. Raisha’s voice is calm.</p>
<p>“I will ask you one question. Please answer yes or no. Is this stolen pouch of coin yours?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I can’t help but feel worried. It’s <em>technically</em> mine by the uncertain rules of finders keepers, and it was on Durene’s property, which is to say, mine. And it was a byproduct of a Skill, but I can’t help but tense a bit. I wait for any reaction, but the cue must have been visual.</p>
<p>“You’re speaking the truth. Thank you sir, I just had to check. Your friend has your belongings now. Thank you for cooperating. I regret that you were the victim of this crime, and hope you will have a pleasant day.”</p>
<p>“Oh—thank you.”</p>
<p>Raisha leaves. Durene steps over, and bends down to talk to me.</p>
<p>“Laken, it was amazing! I ran after that thief—I thought I’d lose him, but I just kept on shouting and someone tripped him up for me! Then I grabbed him and threw him down—I didn’t <em>mean</em> to break anything, but I was just so worried he’d run away! And then Raisha ran over and said that she’d never seen a dumber [Thief]—trying to steal from me I mean, and—”</p>
<p>It’s too much for me. I sit back down hard. Unfortunately, I miss the bench and land hard on the paving stones in the plaza. That hurts.</p>
<p>“<em>Laken!</em> Are you alright?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine, Durene. It’s just…something happened when you were gone.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>I have to laugh as Durene helps me sit down on the bench. How can I tell her? It’s actually easy to say, really. I met someone from my world. Six words. The rest is just speculation.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it.”</p>
<p>I say it again as we sit together. Durene is silent, thinking. I told her what happened. I wouldn’t keep a secret like this from Durene. I don’t think I’d keep anything from her.</p>
<p>“Do you know why she found you? I mean, how?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea. I just know that she must have been watching us—she was talking to me in German, so she must have heard my comment to that guardsman earlier. It might have been coincidence or—she knows about me some other way.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Magic? Or maybe—she mentioned my iPhone might be used to track me somehow. I wonder, can they use the GPS…? I’d imagine it has to be on, but…”</p>
<p>I trail off. After a moment Durene speaks.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do, Laken?”</p>
<p>“Do? Wait for her. But do it intelligently. Before she gets back, I want to just sit—sit and think, Durene.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>She’s a good listener. I have to smile, and when I reach out, she takes my hand. For a few seconds we sit together, sitting <em>together</em>, not just on the same bench. I feel myself calm down and when I have my thoughts in order, tell her what they are.</p>
<p>“We learned a lot, and not just that there are other people like me, Durene.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I think we had better find a bank—or some kind of moneylender. That thief didn’t go after you by chance. Also, I had no idea there were truth spells in this world until very recently.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t? I mean—of course you—but you have things like that in your world, right?”</p>
<p>“Nothing like that. Oh, we have something called a lie detector test—it can’t be trusted. There’s no certainty, no knowing if someone’s telling the truth like this.”</p>
<p>“Wow.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Truth spells, huh? If we had that where I come from, politics might be a lot different.”</p>
<p>I shake my head, thinking about what that might mean. Fact: that guardswoman had a truth stone. Even if that’s only because this is a prosperous city, it means that a truth spell isn’t out of the reach of an affluent member of society. So…</p>
<p>“Things just got a lot more complicated, Durene. I think we’d better wait for Gamel and Ryoka Griffin right here, but in the meantime, here’s what I think we should do.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>Durene’s voice is quivering with…anticipation. She doesn’t seem scared, only focused and ready to act. It seems like when the chips are down, she’s not afraid to be bold.</p>
<p>I admire that—I’m completely scared spitless by recent developments. But—I smile.</p>
<p>“I smell good food. If I hold down the bench here, you can get us lunch. And something for Gamel too.”</p>
<p>“Really? Food?”</p>
<p>Durene is incredulous. I shake my head.</p>
<p>“There’s no use thinking on an empty stomach. And believe me, we’ve got a lot of thinking to do.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“<em>Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn—</em>”</p>
<p>Ryoka stalked down the street, cursing under her breath. She was upset. Not upset at what had just transpired, but she was—tense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Why are ye cursing? You spoke with the blind man while his protector was away, did ye not?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe piped up from her position in Ryoka’s belt pouch. The young woman paused and took a breath.</p>
<p>“I did. It’s just—hell, Ivolethe. Was that the right thing to do?”</p>
<p>The faerie’s answer was an eloquent shrug. She’d found a bug from somewhere and was holding the squirming insect as she pulled a leg off of it. Ryoka had to pause, with people passing by her from every side and giving her dirty looks, to admire that.</p>
<p>“You’re a monster.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Hah! You eat cows and sheep and birds! What’s a small insect to all that?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I don’t eat them live.”</p>
<p>Ryoka paled a bit as Ivolethe tore the twitching leg off and bit at the insect’s abdomen. She closed the belt pouch for a few seconds and collected her thoughts.</p>
<p>“He’s from another world. Fuck. Okay. He’s from another world. What do I do now?”</p>
<p>The Frost Faerie poked her head out and shrugged. She was licking something off her face—Ryoka looked away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Who says you have aught to do? ‘Tis not your business whether he lives or dies. Why not do what ye need to? You have duties. Your enchanted items, learning to run like the wind—”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I know. I know, but—I can’t just ignore him. He could know something important. He could…I can’t just ignore someone else. It’s one thing to know about the kids Magnolia has, but she has no idea about Laken. I want to keep it that way, warn him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“A smart idea. Perhaps.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka glanced down sharply at Ivolethe, but the Frost Faerie’s comment could have been just an offhand insult. After a moment, Ryoka nodded and resumed striding down the street.</p>
<p>“Let’s just find Reynold. I thought he’d catch up by now, but he might have had trouble parking that carriage. That was lucky.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Hm. Perhaps.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka wondered if Ivolethe <em>liked</em> giving her ulcers, or if the faerie didn’t know what effect her words had on Ryoka’s paranoia. No. She had to know. Ryoka shook her head as she made her way out of the plaza—she saw as she went out, some farmer’s kid pleading with a group of adventurers.</p>
<p>“Sirs, please! My village is—it needs protection! We don’t have much money to spare, but—”</p>
<p>He got no further because the adventuring team—a rough-looking group of warriors led by a huge man armored like a Viking—turned away from him in disgust. The young man despondently hurried over to the next group as Ryoka shook her head.</p>
<p>Poor people, without money or friends. It was the same in every world; those who had neither got stepped on. She walked swiftly away, hearing him begin pleading with another group and hoping that he found someone who would listen.</p>
<p>After five minutes Ryoka did find Reynold, or rather, he found her. She was nearly back at the Runner’s Guild when she saw him walking towards her down the street. He…stood out.</p>
<p>A [Butler] walking down the streets of New York City would stand out, and Invrisil was close in nature to fit that analogy. Heads were turning as the trim and elegant Reynold proceeded down the street. He stopped and nodded politely to Ryoka; a grunt was his response</p>
<p>“Took you long enough.”</p>
<p>“My apologies, Miss Ryoka. I was unavoidably detained. May I escort you to your desired meeting with the [Enchanter] in charge of your artifacts now?”</p>
<p>“Lead on.”</p>
<p>The two turned and Reynold led Ryoka away from the business district, into an upscale area clearly occupied by the wealthiest individuals. It was still a place for work to be done, but these were clearly homes that doubled as working places. Ryoka was relieved that Reynold set a good pace; for a man who dressed like a Victorian-era servant, he certainly could move quick.</p>
<p>“I never asked, but you know how to fight, don’t you? Magnolia wouldn’t hire a normal [Butler]. Not her.”</p>
<p>“I do indeed have a few levels in, ah, auxiliary classes which inform my main class, miss.”</p>
<p>“Really? Were you a former adventurer?”</p>
<p>Reynold turned his head slightly. Ryoka met his gaze.</p>
<p>“No, Miss. Not an adventurer.”</p>
<p>There was a tone in his voice that shut down the conversation. Ryoka had used it countless times before. She debated pressing him further, but she couldn’t quite make herself be that rude. She sort of liked Reynold.</p>
<p>“Here we are, Miss.”</p>
<p>Reynold led Ryoka to a rather plain door. Ryoka blinked at the grey granite door and lion knocker. Reynold stepped up and rapped the knocker twice smartly. The Runner stared up at the building that looked like it had been carved completely out of a single block of granite and snorted. It stood out from the elegant facades and buildings covered in paint and architectural daring.</p>
<p>“I can’t say I admire this [Enchanter]’s sense of aesthetics. This building is an eyesore.”</p>
<p>“It is shaped to contain magic. Stone is a necessity to avoid leakage; paint wears away in no time. My dwelling is plain because I have shaped it for function, not visibility.”</p>
<p>A calm voice came from the doorknocker. Ryoka jumped as she saw the lion’s stone eyes had shifted to stare at her.</p>
<p>“You are Ryoka Griffin. And you are Lady Reinhart’s representative? Enter.”</p>
<p>The door swung out, revealing a far more impressively-decorated interior. Ryoka blinked at the rosewood floor and well-lit entryway. Then she stepped into the [Enchanter]’s house.</p>
<p>The door closed behind Reynold as the two walked down the corridor. The inside of the [Enchanter]’s house was no featureless stone building. The flooring, walls, and hanging glass globes of mage light were all extremely costly. But Ryoka’s eye was drawn more to the decorations on the wall.</p>
<p>Wands, swords, a shield, a helmet on a stand or a single metal gauntlet adorned the walls of the [Enchanter]’s home. Ryoka realized in a few seconds that these were ornaments as well as the merchandise; she still had to blink as she entered a living room where a massive greatsword hung over the fireplace.</p>
<p>“I am in my work room. Please, take the door across from you and proceed left down the hallway.”</p>
<p>A voice echoed throughout the house. Ryoka did as instructed, and found herself in a large room filled with oddities.</p>
<p>The first thing she noticed was a circle drawn in the center of the room, a complex diagram of countless lines that formed…well, a circle was the rough shape, but the pieces that made it up were countless symbols joined together—</p>
<p>They glowed white-blue as Ryoka stared at them and she looked away, blinking as her head began to ache. When she could see again she saw a man standing along one wall of the room, holding a sword in his hands.</p>
<p>It was one of the swords that the Horns of Hammerad had recovered. As Ryoka watched, he lowered it into a tub, a wooden basin holding…what?</p>
<p>Dust? No—iron dust, small fillings as fine as powder. The man muttered a word and Ryoka saw the sword’s blade flash in the basin. When the man pulled the sword out, the iron dust had clung to the blade of the sword in a strange pattern. It was clearly a magical symbol, and it changed as Ryoka watched.</p>
<p>“Clever.”</p>
<p>The [Enchanter] turned and the dust fell back into the basin. He nodded at her. Ryoka was surprised to see this man was barely thirty years old. He didn’t seem old at all, but he had a pale cast to his skin that spoke of staying out of the light far too often, and he was missing the ring finger on his left hand.</p>
<p>He was clean shaven, had pale orange hair, a nervous tic where he would tap an object twice with his left finger, and a businesslike attitude. He nodded to Ryoka.</p>
<p>“Yes, the iron dust magnetizes when exposed to the enchantments under the right circumstances. Not with all enchantments, but it is a preferable alternative to other sundry materials.”</p>
<p>He gestured, and Ryoka saw there were other basins in the room containing similar materials. This man also had an anvil and hammer leaning against the wall. No fire though—he’d probably conjure that, wouldn’t he?</p>
<p>“You have quite the setup.”</p>
<p>Ryoka nodded at the anvil. The man didn’t turn his head.</p>
<p>“I do. Now, you have come to have the qualities of your magical items explained, yes? I assume the nature of these artifacts may be shared with the servant accompanying you? And the…thing in your belt pouch?”</p>
<p>“How did you—”</p>
<p>The [Enchanter] tapped the back of his right hand with his left hand’s finger.</p>
<p>“All transactions and words uttered within my abode are private. They will not be shared; rest assured, my wards will keep out even the most powerful of mages from listening in without my knowledge.”</p>
<p>Ryoka glanced behind her at Reynold, who had taken a position by the door. The [Butler] nodded politely at the mage.</p>
<p>“Mister Hedault’s services are recognized as the best in the city. He is extremely competent, and does not reveal any information passed to him in confidence.”</p>
<p>Hedault made no reaction to Reynold’s words. He stared at Ryoka with a fixed, off-putting, focused stare.</p>
<p>“I put a question to you. Will you share the information with the [Butler] and creature you are carrying?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Ryoka muffled the outraged shout from her belt pouch. She stared around and found the items she’d given Reynold to have appraised. A silvery circular buckler with a hairline scratch, a sword whose hilt was burnt but had little else wrong with it, the blade of a sword—the metal deformed in two places, and a dagger. The dagger was curved and sharp; Ryoka thought the tip was reddish, but aside from that the weapons appeared like normal, functional killing instruments. But not magical artifacts.</p>
<p>Then again, what did she know? Ryoka spotted two other small objects—a pack and a small bag that looked like it held only a few objects inside. An adventurer’s pack and bag of holding.</p>
<p>“Did you analyze everything?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I shall list the properties of each artifact first, and then inform you as to the nature of any damages that may have occurred and the probable cost of repair. Please, do not interrupt.”</p>
<p>“Hold on. Do you mean—”</p>
<p>Hedault turned and stared flatly at Ryoka. The girl rolled her eyes and closed her mouth.</p>
<p>“Very well. To begin with, this sword. It is worthless.”</p>
<p>The man walked over to the sword blade without the hilt and lifted it to show Ryoka. He pointed at the melted bits of metal.</p>
<p>“See how the blade has been melted from the heat? The enchantments are broken. Unable to be reconstructed. There is no merit to using the blade; the magic is defunct.”</p>
<p>“Can anything be salvaged? Could you study the enchantment—tell us what it does?”</p>
<p>Another flat look. Hedault tapped the blade twice with his finger and replied testily.</p>
<p>“If there were any use for it I would have stated. I asked you to remain silent.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but I like asking questions.”</p>
<p>This time Ryoka saw the man’s eye twitch. Hedault placed the sword blade back on the table without another word.</p>
<p>“Next, this dagger. It is unharmed from the fire damage. Curiously, it was not affected despite the enchantment not being warded against magical damages. I can only surmise luck played a role in this—”</p>
<p>“Do you want to know where these weapons came from?”</p>
<p>Ryoka couldn’t resist breaking in, just to annoy Hedault, really. He looked at her and she saw Reynold covering his face out of the corner of her eye.</p>
<p>“I do not have to ask. I know. These came from Albez.”</p>
<p>“You could tell?”</p>
<p>“The enchantment style matches the other artifacts recovered from that location. Moreover, rumor points to the Horns of Hammerad having found magical items in that ruin recently. It matters not; the enchantment speaks for itself. Do not ask another question or I will silence you with a spell.”</p>
<p>Ryoka shut her mouth and raised her hands. Hedault sighed and tapped the blade of the dagger twice.</p>
<p>“Note the tip. The blade is common steel, but it is warded against physical harm and heat. When a word is spoken, the tip will ignite. However, the heat will be contained. Thus, when using it like so—<em>Terith.</em>”</p>
<p>He spoke a word and Ryoka saw the tip of the blade began to glow red. But not a bright hot-red; rather, the color seemed almost illusory, a red overlay over the plain steel blade. Hedault turned with the blade extended away from him.</p>
<p>“Observe.”</p>
<p>There was a piece of firewood on the table. Hedault picked it up and touched the tip of the dagger to it.</p>
<p>The entire block of wood burst into flame. Ryoka recoiled and stared at Hedault’s hand, but the man had hurled the firewood away. It hung in the air, burning fiercely as he lowered the dagger.</p>
<p>“<em>Termas.</em>”</p>
<p>The color on the blade returned to normal. Hedault placed the dagger back on the table as the firewood burned in the air behind him. He waved his hand and the blaze ceased, leaving the wood charred but intact.</p>
<p>“As you can see, the flame enchantment is not for heat per se, but to spread fire. An important distinction. The contact radius of the flame is around…the volume of a tree, I should say. Or an Ogre. With it, it would be possible to immolate several targets at once, but the flames will be non-magical. Alternatively, it is possible to set fire to something like the surface of a lake, although the magical aspect of the flame will last for seconds—it will quickly extinguish if the material is not readily combustible.”</p>
<p>“Jeeze.”</p>
<p>Ryoka breathed the words, her heart still pounding.</p>
<p>“<em>That</em> was magic.”</p>
<p>Hedault stared at Ryoka. She bit her lip, remembering his injunction. But he smiled, turning up his pale lips for the first time since she’d seen him.</p>
<p>“It was. A competent spell. Too often the blades I see with heat enchantments are simply <em>hot.</em> But this? A useful tool for a mage to distract the enemy, especially if used with telekinetic spells to strike at range, as the old [Battlemages] often did. Now—”</p>
<p>He turned to the sword. Hedault sighed as he picked it up.</p>
<p>“An intact blade of weight. The enchantment is finer than most, but it is unremarkable.”</p>
<p>He turned and raised a finger to forestall Ryoka’s question.</p>
<p>“This is a common enchantment favored by warriors. It amplifies the weight of the blade when struck with. So—”</p>
<p>He raised the blade and tapped it on the wooden table, using the flat of the blade rather than the edge. The table broke with a <em>crash </em>that made Reynold and Ryoka jump. Hedault blinked at all the weapons lying on the ground and <em>tsked.</em></p>
<p>“Well, this blade is quite powerful I suppose, but otherwise uninteresting. A valuable weapon for a warrior, I suppose. With this grade of enchantment…you could very well fight a creature such as a Wyvern and cleanly slice through its hide with the right swing. Next.”</p>
<p>He put the blade on another table as he levitated the buckler out of the broken wood. Hedault seemed to grow morose as he touched it, showing Ryoka a hairline fracture on the center.</p>
<p>“A shame. This shield is damaged and requires repair. However, the enchantment is largely intact—it will emit a field around the buckler of around three feet in every direction. It is hard to describe to a non-mage—consider it a moving barrier extending the natural shield, with it as the focus. Such a barrier is practically impervious to most weapons, although a strong blow may destabilize it. And of course, the true benefit of such a shield is that it is practically weightless—”</p>
<p>“A force shield.”</p>
<p>Ryoka breathed the words. Hedault cocked his head and nodded.</p>
<p>“Crude, but accurate. This buckler is highly useful, not to mention original. But as I said, it must be repaired first. I will inform you as to the cost later. Now, these conclude the weapons recovered. But this—”</p>
<p>He turned to the adventurer’s pack and flicked his fingers at it. It rose and spilled out its contents into the air.</p>
<p>“Those who recovered this pack were wise not to disturb it. However, there was no trap spell on the bag, merely one to prevent it being opened by the wrong user and reinforce the materials. I have bypassed that; here are the contents.”</p>
<p>He showed Ryoka a sheaf of very cracked and faded papers, a broken inkpot whose contents had spilled over some other objects including flint and steel, waterskin, small brush—a toothbrush?—sealed jars, a small gold ring…</p>
<p>“Most objects were mundane and of little worth. There was also a quantity of rotten food which I disposed of.”</p>
<p>Hedault shuddered and tapped his hand against the bag before levitating something up to show Ryoka.</p>
<p>“—This is what is valuable. These four potions are, in order, a healing potion, a potion to provide sustenance, and two potions which prevent the user from needing to breathe.”</p>
<p>He held out a hand, forestalling Ryoka, but this time the girl didn’t speak. Hedault eyed the smiling Ryoka and explained.</p>
<p>“The potion to provide sustenance is a rare acquisition that [Alchemists] may pay well for. It is not a common discovery in adventurer’s packs however, as they generally fail to stopper said potions correctly…this one is untouched. Drinking a small bit will forestall hunger for a day. Drinking the entire potion at once will provide sustenance for up to a month depending on the level of exertion, and the user will find it difficult to imbibe any other foods in the meantime although it is possible…”</p>
<p>“And the breathing potions?”</p>
<p>“Exactly what they sound like. Generally such potions have the efficacy to provide their users to hold their breath for…two hours. Note that the creation of such potions differ…you may wish to consult an alchemist, but a majority of the potions were made to be held in the mouth rather than swallowed. Swallowing such a potion may result in extreme indigestion. Explosive effects tend to ensue.”</p>
<p>Explosive? Ryoka could just imagine what that meant, and wished she couldn’t. Hedault placed the potions back in the pack dismissively.</p>
<p>“Next. The last items of value are this bag of pebbles and ball.”</p>
<p>He pulled out a bag filled with tiny circular, flat stones and a ball which was made out of leather. Someone had stitched an angry face onto the leather in red thread. Ryoka was tickled by it. Hedault gestured to the pebbles.</p>
<p>“Each one is enchanted to shed [Light] for twenty four hours before fading until exposed to sunlight for an equal amount of time. A useful tool I suppose. But this ball…is quite extraordinary.”</p>
<p>He had that look which told Ryoka it was more interesting than the rest. She stared at it. Hedault pointed to the face stitched in the leather.</p>
<p>“Note the symbol. This one is meant to provoke an opponent. If it is touched here, and then thrown—”</p>
<p>The instant his finger touched the ball, Ryoka saw the stitching contort. The face contorted, and then began to <em>scream.</em></p>
<p>Instantly Ryoka clapped her ears to her head. Reynold did the same, but Hedault just tossed the ball. It immediately shot out of the room and rolled down the corridor, emitting that same ear-piercing <em>shrieking </em>of noise. After a few seconds in which Ryoka shouted and Hedault calmly shook his head, the sound ended and to her surprise, the ball rolled back into the room. It sat at the enchanter’s feet, calm and inactive.</p>
<p>It took a few minutes before the ringing had died down in Ryoka’s ears to hear again. When she did, Hedault calmly picked up the ball and showed her where to press.</p>
<p>“It takes a rather strong force from a living hand to activate it. However, when used it will aggressively seek out any living creature in the nearby area, excluding those in a general radius of activation…if no quarry is found it will return.”</p>
<p>“Useful!”</p>
<p>Ryoka shouted the words. Hedault nodded and smiled.</p>
<p>“Innovative. That is all of worth in the pack.”</p>
<p>Ryoka put her finger in one ear and winced, wondering if she’d lost some of her hearing for good. She saw Reynold shaking his head and turned to Hedault.</p>
<p>“All of this…is this a good haul for a group that went through a dungeon? In your experience?”</p>
<p>He stopped and considered that, hand on the last item, the bag of holding.</p>
<p>“No. Some of these artifacts are indeed valuable—the shield and sword I suppose are most useful—but they are hardly impressive finds. Given the risk, I would say that this recovery is rather mediocre.”</p>
<p>Ryoka’s head lowered. Hedault smiled.</p>
<p>“—If you do not count the contents of this bag, that is.”</p>
<p>Her head snapped up, and Ryoka saw a smile flash over the enchanter’s face.</p>
<p>“You <em>do</em> have a sense of humor. Huh.”</p>
<p>He turned away from her and carefully opened the bag.</p>
<p>“Given the quality of the items recovered, I had assumed the Horns of Hammerad had broken into a competent but average mage for the era, perhaps an intermediary mage in their craft. However, when I finally managed to open this bag…it is clear now that the fire trap spell that triggered consumed many powerful artifacts. Yet this bag was completely unharmed; an appropriate measure given the artifacts contained within.”</p>
<p>Ryoka and Reynold held their breath as the enchanter reached into the bag. The room went silent as Hedault fished around inside and then pulled out…</p>
<p>Three rings and a wand. Ryoka exhaled hard as she stared down at the items in Hedault’s hand.</p>
<p>“Tell me looks are deceiving.”</p>
<p>Hedault appeared annoyed as he placed the items on the table.</p>
<p>“Always. These artifacts are all exceptionally valuable. Let me impress the reasons why upon you now.”</p>
<p>Ryoka gestured for him to go right ahead. The enchanter muttered to himself a bit and then tapped the table as he pointed to the bag.</p>
<p>“Firstly, the bag. It is superbly enchanted. By which I mean to say there is <em>no magical leakage whatsoever.</em> Do you understand the concept around magical interference between artifacts?”</p>
<p>“I get it from context. Leaky magical items conflict? Can’t have a sword and a shield if the enchantments are bad?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Such a combination would lead to a reaction in the worst cases, or a clash of magics which would unleash the spells, alter them in adverse ways, or simply break one or both of the enchantments. But this—this bag is perfect.”</p>
<p>Hedault sighed as he held it up.</p>
<p>“Despite the limited size—you may be able to fit twenty pounds of weight inside at most—it is stellar. A mage practicing magic may carry it without fear of any kind of magical interference.”</p>
<p>“Huh. Twenty pounds? Doesn’t sound that great.”</p>
<p>The look Hedault gave Ryoka said he was considering fitting her head in the bag and giving it a good kick.</p>
<p>“Bags of holding rarely contain more than a few hundred pounds of weight—and those bags are very magically unstable, let me assure you. This is the work of an artisan above my ability. You would be lucky to find another bag so well made.”</p>
<p>“Oh really?”</p>
<p>On a hunch, Ryoka pulled out her bag of holding, the one Teriarch had given her.</p>
<p>“This one holds a bit more than twenty pounds. I fit a bunch of chairs in it one time. I haven’t found the upper limit. Mind telling me how good this one is?”</p>
<p>“Hah. This is…this…”</p>
<p>Hedault’s voice trailed off as he took the bag from Ryoka. He peered at it, and then his eyes bulged. Ryoka snatched the bag back and smiled.</p>
<p>“Good to know.”</p>
<p>It was just a hunch, but why would a Dragon ever have a bag of holding that was less than perfect? Hedault stammered as he stared at her.</p>
<p>“Who made—where did you…?”</p>
<p>“What does this ring do?”</p>
<p>Ryoka lifted a ring up. Hedault had to visibly compose himself for a second—in the corner of her eye Ryoka could see Reynold writing something down. She turned with a frown, but he had tucked it into his waistcoat before she could see.</p>
<p>He was recording all of this down—not just the artifacts, but what she had as well! Ryoka bit her lip and made a note to have words with him afterwards. Hedault shook his head and turned back to the ring Ryoka was holding.</p>
<p>“It is inadvisable to touch something until an [Enchanter] has identified it. In this case, the danger is to me. Please hand it to me.”</p>
<p>Ryoka did. Hedault slipped the ring onto his finger and sighed, going back to his business-like self. Nevertheless, his eyes still glittered as he showed the ring to Ryoka.</p>
<p>“Note the circular diamond in the center.”</p>
<p>“It’s large. Flawless. My g—wow. And perfectly cut.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Hedault nodded, acknowledging Ryoka’s insight into the gem itself. Ryoka had seen valuable gems—she was aware of the difference between cheap cut stones and the really important stuff. The diamond was the latter kind.</p>
<p>“Pure. Without faults. And large—yes. This gem acts in tandem with the metal—it is not, in fact, silver but platinum.”</p>
<p>“You’re kidding me. People knew how to work platinum back then?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes. Platinum is a very powerful metal when used for enchanting or spells…in this case, it acts as a conductor for the spell with the gem. When the ring is put on the finger and the hand is flicked like—”</p>
<p>Hedault paused as he put the ring on his finger. Ryoka saw Reynold duck out of the way, and she herself felt uneasy the instant she saw it go on his finger. The enchanter stared around the room and shook his head.</p>
<p>“…If I used it, my walls would suffer damage. I shall avoid demonstrating it now. Know that this ring can be activated and deactivated. But when activated, a flick—”</p>
<p>He demonstrated after taking the ring off. It was a quick snap of the wrist.</p>
<p>“—will send a piercing spell flying at the target. I believe it would be…difficult to aim without practice, but let me assure you that this spell far surpasses any Tier 2 or Tier 3 spell of a similar nature. It would be…around Tier 4 in potency.”</p>
<p>“Blood on my grave, that’s nasty.”</p>
<p>Reynold muttered out loud and clapped a hand to his face as both girl and mage turned to him. He colored, but Hedault nodded.</p>
<p>“A powerful spell, designed to cut past any quick defense. A perfect tool for an assassin—or a mage disinclined to fight fairly in a magic duel. Very powerful.”</p>
<p>“So I see. And this ring?”</p>
<p>Ryoka pointed to one made out of wood. Hedault shrugged, losing interest.</p>
<p>“Very powerful. Very common. [Barkskin].”</p>
<p>“Do you mean literally bark for skin, or…”</p>
<p>“There may be some physical alterations given time, but only temporarily. The skin will indeed grow tough—not as strong as armor, but certainly far more durable which would be invaluable against daggers and to an extent, swords…but [Barkskin] also provides the wearer with a degree of cold resistance due to the thicker exterior, and of course, some users simply prefer it when travelling outdoors as the sun will provide them with energy…”</p>
<p>“Wait a second, you mean you’ll literally have bark for skin, as in, you can take in light like a plant?”</p>
<p>Hedault gave Ryoka a confused look.</p>
<p>“That is the implication with the spell, is it not? In any case, it is a valuable item, especially given that it is a <em>permanent</em> spell. Again, I impress on you the difference between temporary and permanent. [Stoneskin] is a powerful enchantment, but I have heard of only a handful of cases where it was ever successfully imbued into an artifact.”</p>
<p>“Good stuff. Got it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, well, this ring is far more interesting.”</p>
<p>Hedault shook his head as he pushed the other two rings back and picked up the third. Ryoka’s eye was caught instantly by the way this one was clearly magical. It looked like it was made up of air. That was to say, it was practically invisible, but for shifting…waves in the air. It looked a lot like the shimmering that came off of pavement in the heat, only twisted into a band.</p>
<p>“A ring that allows the user to jump up to six times their height without consequence. Weight will affect the spell naturally, but this…”</p>
<p>The enchanter breathed the words out loud, eyes shining. Ryoka and Reynold blinked.</p>
<p>“Oh come on. <em>That’s </em>your powerful enchantment?”</p>
<p>Ryoka glared at Hedault. The mage looked insulted.</p>
<p>“This enchantment is splendidly made. And though it is not a physical enhancement, the use of gravity magic is—”</p>
<p>“It’s a ring of <em>jumping.</em> Tell me how that’s as useful as a ring that turns your skin into bark or shoots missiles?”</p>
<p>“Well, you could crush a man in armor with your foot if you put it on.”</p>
<p>Ryoka paused with her mouth open.</p>
<p>“Explain.”</p>
<p>“This ring does not simply allow you to ‘jump higher’. It allows you to jump higher and <em>maintain the weight of your fall while protecting the user.</em> To put it in simpler terms, this is not a ring that has a simple [Featherfall] and [Lightfoot] dual enchantment. This ring uses gravity. Thus, if a warrior in plate armor were to jump twenty feet into the air and land, the impact would—”</p>
<p>“Holy crap.”</p>
<p>“Quite. Do you understand? This is no ordinary ring. In fact, a ring of jumping completely misses the point. With it, a user could grab hold of say, a team of adventurers and leap to safety, or use it themselves to travel up a cliff without fear of falling.”</p>
<p>“But there are limits, right? You couldn’t just jump off a cliff and…”</p>
<p>Hedault raised his eyebrows. Ryoka gulped.</p>
<p>“Seriously?”</p>
<p>“The ring will come into focus the more its energies are exhausted. See, it is practically transparent? It will slowly stabilize and its true form—I believe it is a brass band—will emerge. Thus, a user will be able to calculate if it is becoming drained from usage. Although I doubt it would be drained from anything other than a powerful impact. And it will recharge within days at most…”</p>
<p>It was odd. Throughout her talking with Hedault, Ryoka had just marveled at the magical items, wanting to try one or the other, but without any real desire to use any of them. What was she going to do with a sword? Well, it would be fun to chop a few things apart, but…</p>
<p>But now she couldn’t stop staring at the ring Hedault held. She wanted it. Ryoka Griffin wanted it more than anything she’d ever seen in the world. She wanted to climb a cliff with it. Or a mountain. She wanted to jump. She wanted to <em>fly.</em></p>
<p>“Okay, that one’s good.”</p>
<p>“Relatively speaking, it <em>is</em> the second-most powerful item discovered. But this—”</p>
<p>Hedault sighed and picked up the wand. Ryoka’s eye fixed on it. It wasn’t a wand made of wood. It was metal. Iron? The dark grey—almost black metal was twisted like it had been alive, though. It was fashioned as though it were a bit of wood taken from a tree, ending with a blunted tip.</p>
<p>The [Enchanter] looked at Ryoka as he cradled it in his hands.</p>
<p>“Before I inform you as to this item’s usage…I don’t suppose you would consider my offer? I realize it is completely unconventional, but I feel compelled to make it.”</p>
<p>“Which is?”</p>
<p>“Allow me to pay you eighteen thousand gold pieces to purchase this wand from you. I will not make this offer again, and if you desire to accept you must not ask what this wand’s usage is.”</p>
<p>Reynold sounded like he’d inhaled his tongue. Ryoka blinked a few times and put her hand to her ear.</p>
<p>“Eight…eighteen? Not just eight?”</p>
<p>“It is the number for silence, for not inquiring. The wand may be worth less, but this is my price. Will you take it?”</p>
<p>Ryoka gulped as she met Hedault’s eyes. She looked at Reynold—the man was blinking rapidly as his eyes fixed on the iron wand. There was quill and inkpot balanced on his hand as he held a small book in front of him.</p>
<p>The young woman turned back to Hedault and sighed.</p>
<p>“Damnit, if you knew me…I have to know what the hell that wand is. Sorry, no deal.”</p>
<p>Hedault nodded. He looked visibly disappointed—Ryoka supposed that was crying and weeping on anyone else. He stroked the wand and then looked at Ryoka.</p>
<p>“Very well. Then, an explanation first. This wand is not metal as you might surmise. It is iron wood—it comes from a rare tree that is extinct as far as I know. But inside the wand…there is something. A core.”</p>
<p>“You mean, the thing that gives it magic?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I do not know what it is.”</p>
<p>“You can’t tell?”</p>
<p>Hedault shook his head.</p>
<p>“It is something I have never seen before. Something…powerful. This wand is powered by the core—it is a classical wand. I suppose you do not know the difference between a classical wand and variation designed for spellcasting…? No, I see not.”</p>
<p>“Let me guess. One’s better?”</p>
<p>“Substantially.”</p>
<p>Hedault nodded. He indicated the wand he held.</p>
<p>“This wand has no spell attached to it. It is…well, I suppose you could call it an aid to spellcasting, but an aid hardly encompasses…it will boost any mage’s ability to cast spells immensely. Not like the modern wand. Those have cores of course, but these are almost invariably small mana stones. They are consumed with every cast of the spell embedded in the wand—you understand?”</p>
<p>“One’s temporary and helps cast a certain kind of spell, the other one’s good at everything and doesn’t run dry?”</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>Hedault nodded as he reluctantly let Ryoka inspect the wand. It was <em>heavy</em> she found—and the iron wood did indeed feel like wood. Cold, metallic wood.</p>
<p>“Such a wand is…valuable does not begin to describe it. Consider, please, the limits of modern construction. A—a wand made today would have to be of some high-quality wood. Perhaps meltwood, or cerabark? And the core might be unicorn hair or unicorn horn if you were so unimaginably lucky—it would be inferior to this wand by a substantial degree.”</p>
<p>Ryoka whistled as she held the wand.</p>
<p>“Ceria and Pisces are going to tear each other apart over this thing.”</p>
<p>“Any mage would. In fact, I advise you to take care in transporting it—it is not magically significant so a casual [Detect Magic] spell would not identify it immediately if concealed correctly, but any mage worth their salt would do almost anything to obtain such an object.”</p>
<p>Ryoka eyed Hedault.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you lie about what it was, then? Seems odd you’d just tell me what it is after making one offer.”</p>
<p>The enchanter glared at her, outraged by the suggestion.</p>
<p>“I make my living based on my trustworthiness. I would not lie—even when sorely tempted to.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, sorry. It’s just—wow, this is the big one, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It is.”</p>
<p>Hedault grew silent as Ryoka turned the wand over in her hands. He sighed.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Ryoka Griffin. I am told there are two mages in the Horns of Hammerad. One of them will benefit greatly—assuming the other does not attempt to kill them to possess this wand, that is.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see.”</p>
<p>Ryoka put the wand down and turned to Hedault. She felt lightheaded—possibly because she’d listened to him chatter on about magical artifacts for the better part of an hour. Or was it more? She couldn’t tell how long she’d been standing here.</p>
<p>“Was that it? You said something about repair costs…”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes.”</p>
<p>Hedault flicked his fingers and levitated the buckler up.</p>
<p>“This is the only object in need of repairs to function. The hilt of the sword enchanted with weight could use touching up, but that is a minor cost. Now, I estimate that this buckler can be fixed with a modicum of effort and time—say, five days? I could do it myself for a small reduction in fees.”</p>
<p>Ryoka nodded.</p>
<p>“And the price?”</p>
<p>Hedault tapped the buckler twice as he thought.</p>
<p>“I would think that the least I would ask is…one thousand and six hundred gold coins for the buckler, and four hundred…and fifty for the hilt. Now, understand that an error might occur in the repair process in which case the fee will be refunded, but the enchantment will in all likelihood be completely lost.”</p>
<p>He looked up and saw Ryoka had gone dead white.</p>
<p>“If you like, I can offer you a very good price if you would consider trading the wand—”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outside, quite a number of streets away, Laken sighed impatiently. He was sitting with Durene and Gamel, both of whom were flicking crumbs from their lunch and snack at some inquisitive birds who’d flown down to look.</p>
<p>Laken knew he should be at the inn they’d found, feeding Frostwing. And he had business at the Merchant’s Guild—and the Runner’s Guild—and the Adventurer’s Guild. But he was waiting here for Ryoka Griffin.</p>
<p>“Where <em>is</em> she? I wonder if something’s happened?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Across the city, one of the overworked [Receptionists] in the Mage’s Guild sighed long and hard as he got another message in. This one was addressed to a name he’d had cause to curse in the last few days.</p>
<p>He neatly took note of it, recording the sender and the addressee.</p>
<p>To: Ryoka Griffin</p>
<p>From: Erin Solstice.</p>
<p>This was the first message from this sender, but he had messages from…the [Receptionist] consulted the sheet out of idle curiosity.</p>
<p>Ah yes. From Krshia Silverfang, Selys Shivertail, Klbkch (no last name given), Lyonette (no last name given), Ceria Springwalker, Pisces (no last name given), and now Erin Solstice.</p>
<p>He wished she would turn up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least the female [Receptionist] at the Runner’s Guild grimly stopped talking with one of the Runners who’d come in. She was going off-duty for the day, but she left a message for all [Receptionists] on duty. She had a message for Ryoka Griffin too, and she was sure the girl wasn’t going to like it.</p>
<p>And outside, the snow began to fall. The winter was more than half-over. It had been a long one, but the longest day of the year was fast approaching. After that, the snows would linger for a while, but then melt.</p>
<p>Winter was ending. But there was a lot to do first. And much of it turned on a young woman who was currently talking about payment plans with an [Enchanter].</p>

		<p>“Tomorrow, then. Or sooner if I can get a hold of the Horns of Hammerad by mage spell.”</p>
<p>“Very well. Please confine your visiting hours between dawn and sunset.”</p>
<p>That seemed like a fairly easy request, so Ryoka nodded to Hedault as she and Reynold left his house. She supposed that without clocks, appointments were a little harder to keep.</p>
<p>The [Enchanter] stood in his living room and gestured to make the front door swing open. Ryoka saw Reynold stop to bow and thank him. She was almost out the door, having said her goodbyes. From the look on Hedault’s face as he stared at the [Butler], he preferred succinct conversations.</p>
<p>Ryoka paused as she stepped towards the door and turned back to Hedault.</p>
<p>“One last question. Are any of your other artifacts for sale?”</p>
<p>She nodded to a mace neatly hung on a wall plaque. Hedault nodded.</p>
<p>“These are…competent examples of my craft, or artifacts I have purchased for study. I have a small selection of items that I may be willing to sell.”</p>
<p>“Got it. See you later.”</p>
<p>The young woman walked out of the door, Reynold following with another polite farewell. Once she was outside, Ryoka took one look at the sun and cursed.</p>
<p>“How long was I in there?”</p>
<p>“Around an hour an a half by my count, Miss Ryoka.”</p>
<p>Reynold stepped smoothly over to her side as the door silently closed behind them. Ryoka sighed.</p>
<p>“Well shit. Okay, I guess I need to run. Thanks for bringing me here, Reynold.”</p>
<p>“My pleasure, Miss Ryoka.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have anything in particular to do.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“…You can go now.”</p>
<p>Ryoka stared at Reynold. The [Butler] did not move. He stood politely at attention by her side, back perfectly straight. He seemed to be attracting approving glances from a lot of the passersby, and not just because he looked good in a suit. These upstanding citizens probably employed or wanted to employ a man like Reynold, or rather, a [Butler] like Reynold. Then again, Ryoka hadn’t ever seen a Gnoll [Butler] or a Drake [Manservant]. Perhaps they didn’t take to it as well?</p>
<p>She coughed as she began walking down the street. Reynold followed her.</p>
<p>“I don’t need your help, Reynold. How can I put this politely…? Piss off.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I cannot do that, Miss Griffin. My orders were to escort you around the city.”</p>
<p>“And I don’t need an escort anymore. Hold on—”</p>
<p>The young woman’s eyes narrowed as she put the pieces together.</p>
<p>“Magnolia told you to follow me everywhere, didn’t she?”</p>
<p>“That is correct, Miss. I am afraid my orders regarding you were quite specific. I must accompany you everywhere. On that note, shall we return to the plaza? I believe we are late for your meeting.”</p>
<p>The young woman and butler had been striding quickly down the street towards that very spot, where Ryoka had promised to meet Laken. But Ryoka stopped dead in her tracks and turned around.</p>
<p>“You bastard.”</p>
<p>The man’s expression didn’t change. He calmly met Ryoka’s eyes.</p>
<p>“I did not follow you, Miss Ryoka. But I am not the only person in Lady Reinhart’s employ who was given orders regarding you. Happily, the young man you met appears to be still sitting in the plaza, although he is growing restless. May I suggest we continue walking?”</p>
<p>Ryoka did, although now she was ready to do violence. Internally she was cursing. She should have realized Magnolia would set watchers on her!</p>
<p>“Why are you being obvious about spying on me? If you can set watchers so easily, why bother with an escort at all?”</p>
<p>Reynold’s eyebrows rose slightly.</p>
<p>“Lady Reinhart expected you to put the pieces together, Miss Ryoka. I believe this is her way of assisting you—again, in her own way. But she did tell me to be open about her orders if you asked.”</p>
<p>“So I don’t spook and run, is that it?”</p>
<p>“I would not dare to make such an assumption, Miss.”</p>
<p>“I’ll bet.”</p>
<p>For a second, just a second, Ryoka thought about killing Reynold and dumping his body in a ditch somewhere. But of course, Magnolia would know if Ryoka killed her butler. And where would Ryoka find a handy ditch anyways? What about digging a grave? That would be hell in the snow, and Ryoka would have to lure Reynold far out into the countryside to do that…</p>
<p>It was just a passing thought. But it was tempting. She was furious, but Ryoka was already worrying about Laken. She’d given him away, hadn’t she? But he might just be another person from her world, hardly important—the key would be making sure Magnolia’s servants saw it that way.</p>
<p>She turned her head as Reynold kept pace with her down the street.</p>
<p>“Out of curiosity…if I knock you out, how badly do you think Lady Magnolia would react?”</p>
<p>Again, the [Butler]’s face didn’t twitch. It must have been a Skill.</p>
<p>“If you wish to try, I am afraid you may well succeed. I must tell you however that I <em>am</em> under orders.”</p>
<p>“Oh really?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Miss Ressa gave me precise instructions as to what I should do if you offered me violence, Miss Ryoka.”</p>
<p>“Ressa?”</p>
<p>Ryoka looked over at Reynold. He just stared at her. Slowly, Ryoka unclenched the fist she’d made.</p>
<p>“I really hate your boss, Reynold.”</p>
<p>“I believe the feeling is mutual, Miss Ryoka. I see we have stopped again. Shall we proceed?”</p>
<p>“Sure. Remind me to kick your ass when I’m done here, Reynold?”</p>
<p>“I shall make a note of it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, I’d say I’m a pretty patient guy. Well, I do like to keep myself busy, but being blind means that sometimes you’ve just got to wait and think about what you’re going to do next.</p>
<p>For instance, if you’ve lost your walking cane, and you’re in an unfamiliar place, well, you’d better stop and think or you might walk straight into a car. I’ve done that only once before, but believe me, patience is a life saver.</p>
<p>I know better than to hurry things along. There’s a time for action, but if it’s not that time, you might as well take it slow.</p>
<p>Still, I don’t like waiting <em>too</em> long. I shift impatiently on the bench as Durene and Gamel sit next to me. Well, I say sit, but Durene is too big to really share the bench with so she’s sitting on the ground and Gamel seems determined to stand at attention like some kind of personal bodyguard.</p>
<p>Lunch is done. We’ve all had a snack—some very fine Gnollish cooking, which came in the form of a marinated mix of beef and vegetables drizzled in spicy sauce. I was tickled to learn that instead of disposable paper plates, vendors in this city use cheap ceramics. We pay more for the dishes of course, but we get it back if we return our bowls undamaged.</p>
<p>Gamel bought the food and returned the dishes once we were done. He insisted—I would have liked him to rest since he’s been on his feet all day, but he wants to be useful.</p>
<p>Now I turn to him and sense him snap to attention. I don’t have to hear it; I just know he’s standing straighter and turning to face me. It’s so odd. Gamel is only a few years younger than I am, but he thinks I have all the answers.</p>
<p>That’s a dangerous belief. I frown, but put that issue aside for far later. Right now I only have one question.</p>
<p>“Do you see Ryoka, Durene? Gamel?”</p>
<p>“I don’t see anyone, Laken. I mean, there are a lot of people, but—”</p>
<p>“I don’t see any Runner with dark skin, sire.”</p>
<p>“Darn. Where could she be?”</p>
<p>A thousand and one answers come to mind. The first of which is that this Ryoka girl is setting us up for a trap and by waiting, I’ve walked us all into it. I sigh and stand up.</p>
<p>“Well, we’ve waited long enough. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>I grab my walking cane and reach out for Durene, but feel her shift, turn as she touches my hand.</p>
<p>“I—wait, I see her, Laken! That’s her alright!”</p>
<p>I stiffen. I can’t see where Ryoka is coming from, but Durene faces me the right way. I hear Gamel draw in his breath.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“She’s not alone, Laken.”</p>
<p>Immediately, the paranoid part of me starts freaking out. But I keep my voice calm. A leader can’t look nervous. That probably goes triple for an [Emperor], shoddy one though I may be.</p>
<p>“Who is with her?”</p>
<p>“A…I don’t know. What kind of man is that, Gamel? He looks odd.”</p>
<p>“Odd?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Emper—Mister Laken. He has, well, fancy clothes on. They’re all black and white, and he has a bow tie at his neck. He looks like a rich man’s servant, sir.”</p>
<p>“A rich man’s servant…”</p>
<p>I frown. I almost imagine a man in a prison uniform when Gamel says black and white clothes. But they have stripes, don’t they? I don’t know. I think I read about that in a book somewhere, but I haven’t really read a description of prison uniforms in a long time. I always imagine people in that sort of clothing when I listen to news stories about escaped convicts and trials, though.</p>
<p>A servant, though…why would Ryoka have one of those?</p>
<p>“He’s with her?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and they’re—”</p>
<p>Durene breaks off as I hear someone walk towards me. There’s a moment of hesitation as I feel Durene let go of my hand and move. I can’t tell what’s happened, but then I hear the girl named Ryoka speak.</p>
<p>“Laken? I’m here.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Ryoka Griffin? Is that you?”</p>
<p>I don’t know what’s going on, but I opt for pleasant surprise. I listen very carefully to her as she replies.</p>
<p>“Yes. Sorry I’m late. Something came up. I—well, sorry.”</p>
<p>She sounds tense. And worried. Not at all like she did while talking to me before. That was a different sort of tense. This sounds like anxiety in her tone, which means that…</p>
<p>I think quickly and nod, putting a smile on my face.</p>
<p>“Of course. Thank you for coming back. Why don’t we chat over by the benches, assuming they’re not all taken?”</p>
<p>I turn and hear Ryoka cough.</p>
<p>“Your—friend is in the way.”</p>
<p>“Durene? Please let Ryoka past.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Shuffling feet. Then—I hear a man’s voice.</p>
<p>“Ah, pardon me Miss Durene, is it? I would like to introduce myself, if you would permit it.”</p>
<p>“Who are you?”</p>
<p>Ryoka’s voice.</p>
<p>“This is Reynold, Laken. He’s my escort. He’s a friend. A—hold on, let me look this up.”</p>
<p>Silence, shuffling. I hear Durene and Gamel murmur in surprise, but have no idea what Ryoka is doing. So I turn to the man named Reynold.</p>
<p>“Hello. I’m pleased to make your acquaintance. Are you Ryoka’s friend?”</p>
<p>“Not as of such, sir. I—I am a—pardon me, but please accept my most profuse apologies to greet you so rudely. Allow me to introduce myself as Reynold Ferusdam, a humble servant in the employ of Lady Magnolia Reinhart.”</p>
<p>I hear a gasp from Durene and a sound from Ryoka. It’s short, but it makes me think this Reynold fellow has done something. I hold still, but sense nothing.</p>
<p>“Please excuse my rudeness, sir.”</p>
<p>“Not…at all.”</p>
<p>I don’t blink, because I keep my eyelids closed all the time, but I am taken aback. Lady who? What’s this Reynold fellow got to do with Ryoka and why is he acting so formal? Wait a minute. I think I know what’s going on.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways I could reply. I opt for more genuine interest. I smile and extend my hand.</p>
<p>“Oh? Pleased to meet you. May I assume you are a—a [Manservant] or [Butler] of some sort?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, milo—Mister Laken, that is correct. I am a [Butler] currently given the task of escorting Miss Ryoka around the city.”</p>
<p>I feel a light hand—gloved—shake mine and then withdraw. I can tell this man Reynold is wearing some kind of cologne. Well now, I think I understand his odd reaction. Is there a way to make use of it? Perhaps not, but I also fear it might be giving me away a bit.</p>
<p>Someone clears her throat next to me. I hear Ryoka draw closer.</p>
<p>“Goddamn stupid…okay, I think I have it. Laken, Reynold is a friend of a friend. I know Lady Magnolia Reinhart—she’s one of the Five Families in the continent as I’m sure you know, a very powerful [Lady]—and she’s sent Reynold to help me out because I know her. Reynold is a friend. He’s uh—damnit. <em>Freund aber Spion. Achtung. Sag nichts. Verstehst du mich?</em>”</p>
<p>This is why having my eyes closed all the time helps. They don’t narrow and I keep perfect control of my voice.</p>
<p>“<em>Ja.</em>”</p>
<p>So that’s how it is? I smile at Ryoka.</p>
<p>“It’s good to meet someone else who speaks a different language.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is. Around here everyone speaks English. Everyone. Weird, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>There’s a note of humor in her tone. I shrug lightly and turn towards Durene.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Durene, Gamel. I haven’t introduced you, have I? This is Ryoka—I met her today, but we, ah, come from the same place. I think of her as a friend, and I hope you will as well. I think she and Mister Reynold might be able to help us while we’re here.”</p>
<p>I hear people moving and murmuring greetings.</p>
<p>“Hello. My name is Durene. I’m Laken’s friend.”</p>
<p>“Charmed.”</p>
<p>Is it me, or is there not a lot of friendliness in Durene’s tone? I hear Ryoka mutter something and shift—were they shaking hands or something? But then Reynold walks over and I practically feel Durene flush. Listening to her stammer, it sounds like he bowed or kissed her hand.</p>
<p>Well now. Smiling a bit, I sit with Ryoka on the bench. Everyone else stands.</p>
<p>“So why are you here?”</p>
<p>Ryoka’s tone is warning, but I ignore it. Honesty. You can do a lot with honesty, especially when you pair it with omission.</p>
<p>“It’s a long story. Durene and Gamel and I are all from Riverfarm, a small village to the…east, I think. We’ve come here because an avalanche hit the village a few days ago. A good number of people died, and the rest are in trouble since the avalanche wiped out a lot of their provisions for the winter. Not to mention, there’s a danger of monsters, bandit attacks…”</p>
<p>I hear an indrawn breath. So, Ryoka really had no idea why I was here? She shifts on the bench next to me and sounds pained.</p>
<p>“That’s not good. But how are you going to get all those supplies? Buying all that in the winter would cost a small fortune, and that’s without hiring a [Guard] or two.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, sir. Would the other villages be able to assist you? A neighboring town or city, perhaps? Some provinces have local [Lords] or [Ladies] who take care of their subjects, but I’m afraid Riverfarm is not a claimed holding.”</p>
<p>I shake my head at the questions.</p>
<p>“Money isn’t an issue. It’s finding a good supplier of food and a trustworthy adventuring team I’m struggling a bit with. Reynold, you seem to know your way around this city—would you answer a few questions for me?”</p>
<p>“I should be delighted to, sir.”</p>
<p>“Good!”</p>
<p>I smile, and feel Ryoka shift on the bench again. But if she thinks I’ve said too much, she doesn’t do anything. I gather my thoughts. I really only need a few questions answered for the moment.</p>
<p>“Tell me, my good man—”</p>
<p><em>God, I sound like a pretentious idiot.</em> It must be because I’m imagining a real [Butler] standing in front of me. I cough and adjust my tone.</p>
<p>“—I’m afraid I’m new to the city. To this area, really. I’d love to know more about this city. Is Invrisil an independent city-state? I’ve heard those are common around here, rather than nations. Who rules a place like this? A mayor?”</p>
<p>“Invrisil, sir Laken? This city does have an elected leader—Regisand Curle is the appointed [Mayor] for the moment. However, if I may say so, he is more of an administrator than one to set policy.”</p>
<p>“Fascinating. So if I were to ask who the real power behind the throne is…?”</p>
<p>“That would be Lady Reinhart, my employer, sir. Well, I should say Lady Magnolia Reinhart has the power to persuade the city to adopt new policies or to ah, see her point of view, but she rarely uses such authority. Day-to-day it’s usually just the Guilds and various nobles infighting, sir.”</p>
<p>“Really? The Guilds? No, wait—I see. I’ve heard of the Runner’s Guild, Adventurer’s Guild, the Merchant’s Guilds, and so on. How much power do they wield, politically and economically, I mean? Actually, do they have any standing forces of their own? And how would you compare that to the power of, oh, say, the average landed gentry, an average [Lord]?”</p>
<p>I hear Reynold gulp, but he replies quickly.</p>
<p>“The Guilds are a powerful force in any city, sir, although I would wager most [Lords] have just as much authority in their own way. Well, the average [Lord] doesn’t have the coin to match a large Guild, but he does have his own standing forces, and the Guilds usually don’t actively pick their battles. If it comes to blows they hire mercenaries or fight themselves if it’s the Adventurer or Runner’s Guild, but it’s rare for things to get that bad. Mostly, the worse that happens is someone gets assassinated, or finds themselves out of work or disgraced.”</p>
<p>“I see. Hm. So, correct me if I’m wrong, but a [Merchant] would have a bit of influence on their own, but only the most wealthy ones would be put on the same footing as one of the nobility. Is that right?”</p>
<p>“To an extent, sir. There’s an old saying in the north—‘even a [Shopkeeper] can sell a [Lord]’. The poorest [Trader] has friends, and they can boycott a [Lord] who’s wronged him, or lend money to a [Baroness] who needs it for a gala.”</p>
<p>Politics. I shake my head.</p>
<p>“Sounds like a mess. I had no idea it was this complicated around here.”</p>
<p>Ryoka comments sourly next to me. I’m in agreement with her.</p>
<p>“Is it like this everywhere, Reynold?”</p>
<p>“I do believe so. In Invrisil, First Landing—all the major cities have a hand in the politics of the continent, sir. [Lords] and [Ladies] of the Five Families maneuver with each other while [Shopkeepers] and [Merchants] play the same game on a smaller level. I’ve heard the Drakes in the south do much the same thing, although I’ve heard their version of things is far more direct and…material. But politics is the lifeblood of every continent.”</p>
<p>As in our world, so too in this. I incline my head in his direction.</p>
<p>“Well, thank you. That’s all I needed to know.”</p>
<p>So, if you’re a high-level person with a lot of coin—or you’re nobility, or you’re part of a big Guild you’re a mover and a shaker, but everyone else is subject to the power plays of the continent. I wonder what effect my actions might have, if any?</p>
<p>I stand up.</p>
<p>“If the Guilds have power, they’re the ones I need to go to. I was thinking of going to the Runner’s Guild—Ryoka, Durene tells me you look like a Runner. Do you know if they’d be able to get supplies out to Riverfarm? It’s a ways away, and I’d need a lot of supplies. I don’t think a few people can carry all that—how much would it cost to hire, say, fifty people? Or do the Runner’s Guild have wagons?”</p>
<p>“They’ve got bags of holding.”</p>
<p>I smile, delighted.</p>
<p>“No way. In that case, how fast could they travel, oh, thirty miles?”</p>
<p>Ryoka pauses.</p>
<p>“If you had the coin, you could have someone in Riverfarm within the hour I’ll bet. But…don’t go to the Runner’s Guild.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>Gamel sounds astounded. It takes Ryoka another minute to reply.</p>
<p>“They’ve got bags of holding and they’re a lot faster, yeah. But if you need to buy supplies as well as have them delivered, the Merchant Guild might be able to cut you a better deal. They’re rivals with the Runners—they’re slow, but if you’re hiring protection as well, it’ll be cheaper.”</p>
<p>“Huh.”</p>
<p>Not something I’d expect to hear from a Runner, but I’m grateful for the advice. I smile around at everyone.</p>
<p>“I suppose that’s our destination, then. Durene, Gamel, we’re going to the Merchant’s Guild. I don’t suppose you’d like to join us, Ryoka, Reynold?”</p>
<p>“I am bound to escort Miss Ryoka wherever she travels. It would be my pleasure to accompany you if she so chooses.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah, I’ll go. I know where the Guild is—it’s a few blocks away from here.”</p>
<p>“I’ll help take Laken, Miss Ryoka.”</p>
<p>Durene’s voice comes from next to me. She sounds…a bit possessive. But Ryoka doesn’t budge.</p>
<p>“I’ve led blind people before.”</p>
<p>So saying, she takes my hand. I’m surprised, but I think quickly.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, Durene. I’ll walk with Ryoka for a bit. You can see the sights while we chat.”</p>
<p>“But—okay, Laken.”</p>
<p>I hear the hurt tone in Durene’s voice, but Ryoka pulls at my hand and then we’re off. It must be an odd sight as she leads me out of the plaza. I know Gamel, Reynold and Durene are keeping pace with us because I hear Reynold speaking to them, but then Ryoka begins talking.</p>
<p>“Is she your girlfriend or something?”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“The—Durene. She acts like you two are a couple.”</p>
<p>“We are a couple.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>I speak sharply.</p>
<p>“Is there something wrong with that?”</p>
<p>Hesitation. Ryoka sounds guilty.</p>
<p>“No. I—damn it, sorry. I’m just surprised.”</p>
<p>I say nothing in response. After a moment, Ryoka sighs.</p>
<p>“Sorry. She seems protective. She nearly broke my fingers when I shook her hand.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“She thinks I’m a threat.”</p>
<p>“You did come out of nowhere. And even if you are from my world, that doesn’t mean much to Durene.”</p>
<p>Ryoka pauses, and I nearly run into her. I sense her turn.</p>
<p>“You <em>told</em> her you’re from another world?”</p>
<p>“Of course. I trust her.”</p>
<p>“—Okay. Fine. Sure. You told her. Does anyone else know you’re from another world? That Gamel guy, for instance?”</p>
<p>“No. Have <em>you</em> told anyone? Why is that Reynold fellow following you about?”</p>
<p>“He’s a servant of Lady Magnolia. And <em>she </em>knows. In fact, she knows everything. Her servants followed me—they were probably listening to us when we spoke the first time, and they’re probably listening now. Keep that in mind.”</p>
<p>“I will. But if they’re, ah, ‘friends but spies’, should I trust them or not?”</p>
<p>“…I don’t know. Magnolia’s not evil, but she’s not nice either. She might not care you’re from another world—she’s found other people like us.”</p>
<p>“Really? How many? Where were they?”</p>
<p>Ryoka gives my hand a squeeze.</p>
<p>“Just a few. Looks like a few other people got pulled to this continent. Maybe we all got hit by a rogue spell or something. There are five or six kids around our age—maybe a few years younger. But that’s all I know.”</p>
<p>Another squeeze. I gently tighten my fingers to let her know I understand. So Magnolia knows a lot, but not everything? How many of us <em>are</em> there? Why are we here?</p>
<p>I guess that’s a bad topic, so I go back to Magnolia.</p>
<p>“What’s she like? If she hires [Butlers], can I assume she’s rich?”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah. She’s one of the Five Families—they’re the richest nobles on the continent. She’s a [Lady] with an army of servants, tons of magical artifacts, a magical horseless carriage…”</p>
<p>“Are you serious? First bags of holding, now magical automobiles—are you going to tell me adventurers run around with flaming swords and shields of wonder?”</p>
<p>“Hah. Close. Try flaming daggers. But seriously—watch out for Magnolia. She might appear friendly and nice, but she’s devious. Imagine her as a—a—do you, I mean, did you watch Game of Thrones back home?”</p>
<p>I twitch a bit, but keep walking.</p>
<p>“I did. Watch is a bit strong, but I did a lot of listening to audiobooks and I listened to some episodes with visual description turned on.”</p>
<p>“Then imagine her as a Daenerys except older.”</p>
<p>“Sort of like Cersei Lannister?”</p>
<p>“Sort of. But…smarter. Less arrogant. Daenerys is a better analogy, especially given that she has one big thing in common with her. I mean, not as a mother, but a friend. And she’s twice as cunning as both Daenerys and Cersei put together—and she’s bold like Catelyn Stark, got it?”</p>
<p>“I get it. And she knows about you, or rather, us?”</p>
<p>“About everyone. She’s met people…like us, before. And she knows about one of my friends. Her name is Erin Solstice. She lives far south of here, in Liscor. She’s an [Innkeeper]…I’d like you to meet her sometime.”</p>
<p>“I’d be delighted. But I do have to help Riverfarm.”</p>
<p>“The village? Why? Because Durene lives there?”</p>
<p>“Yes. And because they’re good people. Well, fairly good. They’ll starve or die without help.”</p>
<p>“And you can do it?”</p>
<p>“I think so. I wasn’t expecting to meet someone from another world, though.”</p>
<p>“Neither was I. I just heard you speaking German and—look, I’m sorry I got you mixed up in this.”</p>
<p>I shrug fractionally.</p>
<p>“Politics. I’d get involved sooner or later, especially considering…well, let’s just say that having your friend here and learning a bit about the city might be helpful. If this Lady Magnolia really is a friend to the people, I think she’d approve of what we’re doing here.”</p>
<p>Ryoka’s quick pace falters. I hear her take a breath as people shout at a rude wagon driver ahead of us.</p>
<p>“About buying supplies. Do you need help with getting supplies for this village of yours? If you need coin I…damnit, I’ve got some, but—”</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine. Trust me.”</p>
<p>Silence. Then Ryoka stops.</p>
<p>“I’ll try.”</p>
<p>I tap the ground experimentally with my walking stick, but feel no difference in the paving stone around me. Not that I really expected it.</p>
<p>“We’re in front of the Merchant’s Guild? How does it look?”</p>
<p>“Big. Fancy. They went all out on the architecture around here. Lots of gold paint.”</p>
<p>There’s a sneer in Ryoka’s voice. I hear the others catch up, and then Durene speaks.</p>
<p>“Laken! We’re in front of the Merchant’s Guild!”</p>
<p>Is it just me, or is she right between me and Ryoka? I smile up at her.</p>
<p>“I know. Ryoka, can you give us a second? I want to talk with Durene before we…”</p>
<p>“Got it. Hey Reynold, come over here.”</p>
<p>They retreat. I’m left alone with Durene and Gamel, although he’s standing further away. I whisper up to Durene.</p>
<p>“Do you not like Ryoka?”</p>
<p>“I—I don’t trust her, Laken. Are you sure she’s someone you know?”</p>
<p>“I think I can trust her. But tell me, is there anything I missed back in the plaza? When that man Reynold introduced himself, you and Gamel made a noise.”</p>
<p>“Yeah! When he was speaking he—he <em>bowed </em>to you, Laken! He bowed really low!”</p>
<p>“As one would to a…someone like me?”</p>
<p>“Someone like—oh, yeah!”</p>
<p>“Interesting. Don’t say anything about it for now, okay? It’s a secret. Tell Gamel that.”</p>
<p>“Okay Laken. But…”</p>
<p>I can practically see Durene’s face, upset with confusion and nerves.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? This is all so sudden! What are we going to do in the Merchant’s Guild, hire a bunch of wagons?”</p>
<p>“Close. I actually think we can get done most of what we need to while we’re in there. It’s going to be complex, Durene. But we can handle it. All you need to do is look impressive. I think you can do that.”</p>
<p>“But what should I do? I don’t know anything about—money or stuff like that. Are you sure I should come in with you?”</p>
<p>“What, and leave me alone? I need you, Durene. Will you come with me?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>It’s a response without a second of hesitation behind it. Just one word, but it blows away my self-doubt and my own fears. I smile as Durene squeezes my hand with the utmost care. She’s with me, and she’s all the help I’ll need. How could I ask for more?</p>
<p>And yet, I have more. Gamel is right beside us, faithfully going along with all of this although he clearly doesn’t understand what I’m thinking. He trusts me. He’s loyal.</p>
<p>What an odd thought. But he is my subject and I’ll do right by him.</p>
<p>So it’s not Laken the confused guy who stops in front of the Merchant’s Guild, it’s Laken the [Emperor]. He’s listened and heard all of what’s going on and he has a good idea of the situation he’s in. And he has a plan.</p>
<p>I gesture for Gamel to come over, and we huddle together in front of the Merchant’s Guild as I explain what I want to do. Politics. [Lords] and [Ladies] and Guilds and [Merchants]. Well, I’m an [Emperor] so I trump all of them. I smile as I speak to my two followers, my two subjects, my two friends.</p>
<p>“Okay you two, here’s what we’re going to do. Durene, I want you to open the doors like this when we go in…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the blind young man known as Laken stood with his two friends, Ryoka waited a few feet down the street with Reynold. She pulled something out of her pocket—an iPhone—and tapped on the screen.</p>
<p>Ryoka glanced down at her iPhone and closed the encyclopedia app she had been using. It had been a long, long time since she’d last used it but she was glad to know that it could still work offline.</p>
<p>“Guess it’s not a waste of gigabytes after all.”</p>
<p>She tucked it away in her pocket and sighed. What a mess. She had no idea what Laken was about to do, but from the way the villager and half-Troll girl were reacting, it was going to be surprising.</p>
<p>“I have no idea what the hell is going on.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Ye never do.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe poked her head out of Ryoka’s belt pouch, chewing on a walnut. She was actually eating the shell as well as the nut itself. Ryoka eyed the small blue faerie. She wondered if Laken could hear Ivolethe like Erin could. If so, that might be a better way of letting him know important details.</p>
<p>But what did he really need to know? Everything Ryoka knew about the other people scattered across the world, about Erin and the dangers of the Antinium and so on—that was for a much longer conversation, later. Right now she could only trust he wouldn’t blurt out anything important.</p>
<p>She didn’t think he would, honestly. She was surprised by how fast he’d caught on to everything.</p>
<p>“At least I got the message to him. Thank god for monoglottism in this world.”</p>
<p>Ryoka saw Ivolethe’s small head turn towards her and laugh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Hah! I heard thy terrible attempt at language.<em> Deine Aussprache ist schrecklich.”</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka scowled down at her belt.</p>
<p>“How the hell do you know what I—no, don’t tell me. I guess you lot were all over Europe back in the day, huh?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I travelled to many lands, and learned many tongues! You sound as if you were speaking with mud and worms in your mouth!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah.”</p>
<p>Ryoka scowled and closed the belt pouch over Ivolethe, ignoring the tiny faerie’s shout. She turned her head slightly, and regarded Reynold.</p>
<p>She hadn’t had time to ask, but she was intensely curious to know why he’d bowed like he had when meeting Laken. The man was still pale and shaking a bit even after their short walk.</p>
<p>“Hey Reynold. What was that, back there?”</p>
<p>The [Butler] jumped as if Ryoka had shouted in his ear. He jerked his eyes away from Laken, and stared at Ryoka. Then he stepped over and hissed at her, completely forgetting about politeness or decorum.</p>
<p>“Who <em>is</em> that man?”</p>
<p>“Laken? I have no idea.”</p>
<p>“Don’t give me that! He is—I’ve never felt—”</p>
<p>Reynold’s cheeks were flushed. He kept staring at Laken.</p>
<p>“What did you feel?”</p>
<p>Ryoka eyed him closely. Reynold opened his mouth and shook his head.</p>
<p>“He was like—I suppose it was like standing before Lady Reinhart, or Lord Veltras. One of the high nobility, Ryoka. Only more intense. It’s a sense most [Servants] have—I felt as though I should have been prostrating myself at his feet.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>The young woman’s eyes narrowed. She stared at Laken and saw him step back from the huddle with Durene and Gamel. Durene carefully took his hand and they began moving towards the Merchant’s Guild.</p>
<p>“Hold on, here we go. Let’s see what he’s about to do.”</p>
<p>This was what Ryoka saw. She saw Durene march up to the doors and then let go of Laken. He grabbed hold of Gamel’s shirt instead, and waited as Durene stood in front of the two ornate double doors.</p>
<p>She attracted attention. For all the half-Troll girl was wearing rough clothing, Ryoka had to admit that she was impressive. Durene was the tallest person around, and when she stood tall and didn’t slouch she was a true giant. She grabbed hold of the door handles and flung the doors wide open.</p>
<p>“Now <em>that’s</em> an entrance.”</p>
<p>Ryoka commented as she followed Laken and the others inside. The dramatic opening had made the entire Merchant’s Guild go silent, or maybe it was seeing Durene come striding through the doorway. Either way, suddenly all eyes were on Laken and Durene and Gamel.</p>
<p>No, they were all on Laken. For all of Durene’s height, there was something about the blind man that drew the eye. Ryoka blinked and rubbed at her own eyes as she stared at his back. Was he…taller? No, but he seemed like it.</p>
<p>What was going on? She frowned hard as Laken walked forwards.</p>
<p>The Merchant’s Guild was as gaudy and plush on the inside as it was on the outside. It had [Receptionists] but other counters as well, places to exchange coin, sell goods, take out loans, and so on. Impressive brass scales were a fixture of the room, as well as other handy measuring tools and things like abacuses—all aids to calculating the worth of an item down to the last copper coin.</p>
<p>Ryoka expected Laken to march up right to one of the receptionist’s desks, but he didn’t do that. He took ten steps into the room and then stopped there. With all eyes on him and his companions Laken stopped and waited as Durene bent down to whisper in his ear.</p>
<p>“Of course. He can’t see.”</p>
<p>Ryoka murmured the words. It was necessary for Laken, but the effect it caused was impressive. There he was, standing in the center of a whirlpool of attention, waiting. The effect was also immediate.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a lowly [Receptionist] that came hurrying towards Laken across the floor, but a balding, portly man that Ryoka pegged as a [Merchant] or some higher Guild official. She saw him stop as Durene turned to block him, and then hurry forwards and seize Laken’s hand. After a few moments of discussion, they walked over to some chairs and a table set to one side of the room.</p>
<p>That was ordinary. But Laken was not. He sat politely across from the [Merchant], eyes closed, smiling as he talked. And Durene stood protectively next to him, a half-Troll bodyguard while Gamel stood on the other side, looking fiercely proud despite his simple clothing.</p>
<p>What was going on? Who was that man? Why did he catch the eye so? Ryoka heard the murmuring, and saw the people waiting in line or doing business sneaking glances over at Laken as the guild slowly began to get back to business. Some people took seats at tables next to Laken’s, others simply wandered over as they chatted quietly.</p>
<p>It was a Skill, or something about Laken. Ryoka watched, arms folded by the doors as Reynold scribbled in his notebook furiously. Laken sat and smiled as he talked to the [Merchant], radiating confidence like a beacon.</p>
<p>He did nothing dramatic, and his words were inaudible except to the people closest to him. And yet, he had a presence that weighed down on his surroundings and dragged every eye to where he sat. Slowly, the room began to revolve around him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sit with the [Merchant] named Merec in the center of his guild and thank god that they have padded seats in here. The bench in the park wasn’t bad, but after more than an hour of sitting on its hard surface, I could use some support for my backside.</p>
<p>Especially because I have the feeling I’ll be here for a while. I sit with my back straight in the chair, hearing quiet voices around me, people haggling, or buying goods in bulk, negotiating deliveries to other cities.</p>
<p>Doing business, in short. It’s not distracting to me, and I can tune it out, but it’s a reminder that we’re sitting in the open, in the center of the guild.</p>
<p>“Again, Mister Laken, I would be quite happy to seat you in a private room to discuss any business. I’m sure a man such as yourself might prefer the privacy.”</p>
<p>“I feel quite comfortable conducting my affairs out in the open, Mister Merec. I have nothing to hide, after all.”</p>
<p>The Merchant’s Guild has private rooms of course, although they might not be that private. I’d bet some of them have listening spells or peepholes…I smile in the general direction of the merchant. I hear him swallow, and then speak.</p>
<p>“Well then, I’m happy to get down to business. What ah, did you say the nature of your visit was about? Did I hear your—your helper correctly when she said you wanted to place a big order?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, Mister Merec. A large order. I would like to purchase food, supplies, livestock, tools, and so on for a village of around a hundred people. Of course, not just for one meal or two—I’d like to make a purchase that will last them the rest of the winter. To that end, I’d like to hire at least…twelve wagons, I suppose, and the appropriate guards to protect such a delivery. I was thinking at least two teams of adventurers might do.”</p>
<p>I don’t quite hear Merec inhale his tongue, but he comes close.</p>
<p>“S-supplies? For a village? May I ask what this is about, sir?”</p>
<p>“Riverfarm, my good man, Riverfarm.”</p>
<p>“Where…? I’m sorry, Mister Laken, but I’ve never heard of such a village.”</p>
<p>“Really? You haven’t? But their cabbage exports are a local keystone of the markets!”</p>
<p>I try to sound upset, but the truth is I’m laughing inside. I steeple my fingers and lean forwards over the table.</p>
<p>“I happen to be a great friend of the villagers there, Mister Merec. You may not have heard, but an avalanche hit the village and surrounding region not three days past. It was a tragedy, and many lives were lost.”</p>
<p>“I—I had heard something of the kind, sir. So these goods are for the village?”</p>
<p>“Yes indeed. I’m in rather a hurry, so if you could have the wagons loaded and sent out in, oh, an hour’s time that would be best.”</p>
<p>“I—well, hold on now.”</p>
<p>Merec tries to take back command of the situation. I hear saliva moving as he pauses, and then his tone becomes genial, professionally good-humored.</p>
<p>“We would love to fulfill your request, Mister Laken. But before we talk details, may I ask how you intend to pay for all of this? I hesitate to ask, but with such a huge transaction in mind—”</p>
<p>“Of course! Let’s not beat around the bushes, Merec!”</p>
<p>I raise my voice and feel the man wince. People around me go silent as I sit taller in my chair.</p>
<p>“Riverfarm needs aid, Mister Merec. Posthaste! Today, if it can be managed! I came to the Merchant’s Guild because I was told you could help me better than the Runner’s Guild.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s certainly true, sir. We have the goods—those Runners would have to come to <em>us</em> for supplies. But about payment—”</p>
<p>I wave an impatient hand at him.</p>
<p>“Money is no object. Durene, would you please put the bag on the table so Mister Merec can see it?”</p>
<p>I hear Durene fiddle with her belt, and then a heavy <em>thump</em>. Merec’s chair screeches back, and then I hear him and voices around him gasp and exclaim.</p>
<p>“Dead gods!”</p>
<p>“Is that—”</p>
<p>“Are these gems, sir? And this—”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I didn’t have time to convert it all into gold—but I believe exchanging gemstones is one of the functions of your guild, isn’t it? Well, I’ll leave sorting out the exact worth till later, but I assume this will be adequate?”</p>
<p>“Ah—ah—”</p>
<p>I think I broke the poor man. I tap a foot on the ground until Merec manages to speak again.</p>
<p>“Of course. Of course—you there! Bring over some chairs for Mister Laken’s escorts, now! And have drinks sent for—may I offer you some refreshments, Mister Laken?”’</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say no, but I <em>am</em> in a hurry, Mister Merec.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. I completely—thank you. There’s just one matter I must attend to. I’m terribly sorry, but in cases like this—would you mind taking an oath on a truth spell? It’s just that in cases like this where we cannot be sure where this money has come from—”</p>
<p>“Are you accusing me of having stolen that money?”</p>
<p>I interject a note of frank incredulity into my tone. Durene makes an ominous noise.</p>
<p>“Laken <em>didn’t</em> steal that. All of this is his!”</p>
<p>Merec makes a very small sound, and I imagine him shrinking back as Durene towers over him.</p>
<p>“No, of course…it’s just a matter of protocol, see? I’d never question—please, Mister Laken—”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, Durene.”</p>
<p>I wave a hand at her and hear her step back. I smile brightly at Merec.</p>
<p>“I understand completely. Can I assume you have a stone of some sort I’d put my hand on?”</p>
<p>“Yes sir. It’s right here…if you just keep it close to your person, it will shine and uh, tell the truth.”</p>
<p>“Very well. In that case, allow me to go a step further so I may clarify matters.”</p>
<p>I reach out and find the stone on the table after a few seconds of searching. I pull it closer and speak carefully.</p>
<p>“This money is mine.”</p>
<p>I hear a murmur as the stone presumably lights up. I trust that I’m not being made out to be a liar and go on.</p>
<p>“I am a relative newcomer to this land, but I am deeply concerned with the wellbeing of the people of Riverfarm, who took me in and offered me hospitality during my time of need. My wealth comes from my, ah, class. It was not stolen from anyone to the best of my knowledge, and it is mine by right.”</p>
<p>More murmuring. I lift my hand away from the stone.</p>
<p>“I trust that satisfies your questions, Mister Merec?”</p>
<p>“It does indeed, sir. I apologize most sincerely for the inconvenience, but—ah—may I ask what your class is?”</p>
<p>“You may ask, but I may not answer.”</p>
<p>I smile at Merec. I hear him hesitate.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t happen to be of the aristocracy, sir? Forgive my curiosity, but it’s very rare to have someone of your status in our guild. Most nobles send servants you see…”</p>
<p>I just smile. No reply. But I hear the small intake of breath, and know the crystal has probably changed color again. Tricky, that. But all to the better. An [Emperor] is the highest form of nobility, after all. I gently push the stone back across the table just to be sure I don’t trigger it again.</p>
<p>“Well then, now that the truth has been established, let us go back to business. Food, Mister Merec.”</p>
<p>“Of course! We can have a shipment prepared—at a very reasonable price, as well. Ah—however, I hate to mention this, but at this point in the year grain and meat and so on <em>is</em> very dear. I’m afraid you’ll be paying quite the steep rate for all of this…”</p>
<p>I raise a hand and the man falls silent.</p>
<p>“As I’ve said, money is no object. I know you would not cheat me or drive up the price unfairly, Mister Merec.”</p>
<p>“I would <em>never—</em>”</p>
<p>“I know. I don’t need a Skill, spell, or even eyes to see that. An honest price—and coin in your pockets for work well done—is all I need. I don’t fear being lied to, you see.”</p>
<p>“You…don’t?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. You see, liars and cheats have a way of revealing themselves to me, Merec. Which is why I trust you. After all, being blind means that when people try to pull the wool over my eyes, it doesn’t do a thing.”</p>
<p>I laugh a bit at that. After a second, I hear a polite, rather forced chuckle from Merec. I smile as if I’ve told a good joke. It’s all in the face. I keep it as open and as normal as possible, acting as if I’m talking with a good friend. It helps that I don’t have to do anything with my eyes.</p>
<p>Telling lies? I’m not telling lies. And I’m not dancing about with the truth either. I really <em>don’t </em>have a way of telling if someone’s lying to me. But I can make him think I do.</p>
<p>I’m just letting Merec and all the others do all the thinking and plotting and analysis of every word and move I make. The key is to make them think I’ve got depths, when in fact I’m about as deep as a puddle.</p>
<p>Mind games. From what Reynold and Ryoka said, the important people in this world like to play games with each other and read into every move anyone of power makes. My hope is that in a world of backstabbing, duplicitous schemers, they’ll never expect an honest man.</p>
<p>Well, semi-honest. Sort of. At least I make an effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka rubbed at her eyes as the discussion went on. Laken sounded <em>exactly</em> like some kind of antagonist explaining his modus operandi on a television show to her. She’d felt like cringing when he made that joke. It was an over-the-top performance, but, and she had to admit this reluctantly, it was working.</p>
<p>It was the way he said it that sold the acting, and that incredible presence he had. You could believe that Laken was some reclusive, eccentric nobleman helping out a village he had taken a liking to. Every eye was on him and some people were openly listening to his discussion, not bothering to hide their interest.</p>
<p>They were all probably wondering which royal house Laken came from, which noble family. Ryoka was wondering much the same thing, although her main question was <em>how</em>. She knew he…but the stone had…Ryoka’s head was hurting already from all the suspicions bottled up in her chest.</p>
<p>And yet, it was all working in Laken’s favor. His entire presence was a tantalizing mystery. Who was the strange man with the bag of gold and a Troll bodyguard? Ryoka could see the gears whirring in people’s heads and decided to give Laken a hand.</p>
<p>She looked over and saw Reynold still writing furiously in the notebook, dipping his quill quickly into the small inkpot he held. She had to admire that—pens were so much easier than having to balance ink and quill and notepad with just two hands. She moved over and elbowed him, making the [Butler] jump.</p>
<p>“Hey. Get in there.”</p>
<p>He stared blankly at her.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>She nodded toward Laken and Merec as they began to discuss prices and what exactly Laken wanted.</p>
<p>“Do something. Anything. Just enter the conversation, alright? It doesn’t matter what you say, only that you’re there, saying it.”</p>
<p>Reynold hesitated, and then shook his head slightly.</p>
<p>“Miss Ryoka, my job is to escort you.”</p>
<p>“And take notes.”</p>
<p>He flushed a bit and lowered his quill.</p>
<p>“Well I—I can’t just interfere in business like this. It’s not my place.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Okay.”</p>
<p>Ryoka shrugged and walked away. After a few moments Reynold went back to writing down what was being said. He glanced over towards Ryoka and realized she was gone.</p>
<p>Reynold’s head turned frantically, but she wasn’t anywhere in front of him. Then he felt two hands on his back. He half turned—</p>
<p>And Ryoka shoved him.</p>
<p>She pushed Reynold forwards, sending the [Butler] stumbling closer to Laken and Merec. Reynold regained his footing and posture immediately and looked graceful while doing it, but now all eyes were on him. Ryoka looked the other way and twiddled her thumbs behind her back.</p>
<p>“Oops.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I break off when I hear the scuffle of feet on the floorboards.</p>
<p>“Is someone there?”</p>
<p>I hear a man clear his throat, and then hear a familiar voice.</p>
<p>“Reynold, sir Laken. May I offer you my services in this matter?”</p>
<p>I hesitate, but only for a second. Why is he helping? No, don’t question it—just roll with the cards that are being dealt.</p>
<p>“I would be most grateful, thank you. Do you by any chance know how much I should be paying for forty bags of barley?”</p>
<p>I hear Reynold sniff delicately.</p>
<p>“Given the way the Merchant’s Guild does business, I would question whether the goods being sold are of acceptable quality. Master Merec, I trust these prices all reflect the condition of the wares for sale? I have heard of weevils and Harvest Devils being found in warehouses in the city as of late.”</p>
<p>Merec splutters.</p>
<p>“Our goods are beyond repute, sir. I can have a sample brought over—”</p>
<p>“A sample might do, but a personal inspection of random bags at the site would not be objectionable, I trust?”</p>
<p>“No—no—”</p>
<p>“Very well then. But I also trust you are not wasting Mister Laken’s time with trivialities such as individual item counts? The Merchant’s Guild surely has a list of the cheapest and most plentiful products on hand, does it not?”</p>
<p>“I—will have some sent for right away.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka grinned as she watched Merec stand and hurry off to speak urgently with some harried employees.</p>
<p>“Not bad, huh?”</p>
<p>Ivolethe, munching down on another walnut, just shrugged in reply. Ryoka shook her head.</p>
<p>She didn’t know what Laken’s game was, not exactly, but she knew he needed to have the [Merchants] here thinking he was a big shot. And who better to help with that bit of fiction than Reynold the [Butler]? They might not know who he was on first sight, but Ryoka would bet every gold piece she owned that the people staring at him and talking behind their hands were trying to figure out which [Lord] or [Lady] he served. Once they found out he was Magnolia’s aide…</p>
<p>“Ooh, looks like they’ve put it together.”</p>
<p>She’d never seen a ruddy face go that pale that quickly. Merec made his way back to Laken with profuse apologies and offered him a frothy fruit drink. Ryoka could have used one herself, but only Laken, Durene, and Gamel were getting the deluxe treatment. The negotiations went on, and Ryoka shifted from leg to leg until she heard adventurers being brought up.</p>
<p>“We have several good teams, Mister Laken. There are Gold-rank teams I could hire if you—”</p>
<p>“I want those two teams, Mister Merec. The Celestial Trackers and the Windfrozen Riders.”</p>
<p>“As you say sir, but may I ask why those two…?”</p>
<p>Ryoka saw Laken lean back and smile mysteriously. She wondered if he’d practiced that smile or if he was just that good at acting. Or maybe that was just how he smiled?</p>
<p>“Here’s the thing, Merec. May I call you that? I need adventurers to protect Riverfarm, but I don’t want to hire people who just want coin or who will look down on the villagers. Why those two teams? Well, early today, I sent my…man out to all of the adventuring groups he could find earlier this day, begging for help. Of the ones he talked to, those two were the only ones who didn’t immediately send him off or laugh at him.”</p>
<p>Ryoka turned to stare at Gamel. Wait a second—she <em>remembered</em> seeing him doing that! He’d been approaching the teams in the plaza, begging for help!</p>
<p>“Clever.”</p>
<p>Laken went on, explaining his reasoning to an enthralled Merec and the audience around him.</p>
<p>“When I was young, I heard a story about a [King] who did very much the same thing. Well, the story has many forms, but it’s always the same. The [King] would go out, disguising himself as a peasant or ordinary man and talk with people, ask for aid, or challenge them to ascertain their worth. Only after he had gotten the measure of them would he reveal himself. For you see, people aren’t genuine when they know you’re rich or powerful. I want those teams, Merec. They might not be famous, but they do care.”</p>
<p>“Of course, sir. I will have someone go over to the Adventurer’s Guild this instant—”</p>
<p>The young man held up a hand and Merec fell silent.</p>
<p>“I want to hire them not only to escort the wagons, but to guard the village for at least a month. If they won’t agree, then I will find another team. You may post more guards and adventurers if you want, but I need at least two groups to protect the village. Now, if you will tell me the price I’d be paying for that…”</p>
<p>Ryoka turned and moved out of the crowd of onlookers, shaking her head as she left the Merchant’s Guild.</p>
<p>“Amazing. How the hell did he get all that money, Ivolethe?”</p>
<p>The faerie just stared up at Ryoka, cheeks bulging. She swallowed and didn’t answer. Ryoka scowled.</p>
<p>“Whatever. But at least I’ve got Reynold off my back. Well, there are probably other spies around, but I hope they like running.”</p>
<p>She left the building and began to jog and then run down the street. Back inside the Merchant’s Guild, Reynold stood to attention next to Laken. He knew Ryoka had gone, had seen her leave, but he couldn’t make himself abandon the conversation. Laken kept asking him questions and Reynold found himself pressing Merec hard on the young man’s behalf. He was stuck, and Reynold realized this might have been Ryoka’s plan all along.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka had intended to go to the Mage’s Guild to send the Horns of Hammerad a message, but she found herself in the Runner’s Guild first. It was just a thought. She wondered if the [Receptionist] had heard about Valceif yet.</p>
<p>But when she approached the counter, the young man on duty immediately asked her to wait. Confused, Ryoka found herself ushered to the side while one of the staff on duty went to go get the [Receptionist] she’d talked to.</p>
<p>When the woman came walking down the stairs, Ryoka realized something was wrong. It was written all over the woman’s face. The young woman felt a lurch in her stomach, though she didn’t know what the problem was.</p>
<p>“Miss Ryoka? You were asking about the whereabouts of Valceif Godfrey?”</p>
<p>The [Receptionist] led Ryoka to an unused counter to talk. Ryoka nodded, keeping her voice deliberately casual.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I was wondering. Do you know where he is?”</p>
<p>“I do, Miss. I’m sorry to say that Valceif is dead. He was killed two weeks ago on a delivery.”</p>
<p>Ryoka blinked. She rubbed at one ear and stared into the other woman’s grave eyes. She opened her mouth and slowly closed it.</p>
<p>“How? I mean—I mean—how? How did it happen?”</p>
<p>“He was killed on a delivery, Miss Ryoka. A group of [Bandits] waylaid him. It wasn’t an assassination or someone trying to intercept his delivery. It was simply—bad luck.”</p>
<p>A hole had opened up in Ryoka’s chest. She felt herself lurching, felt all the positive emotions drain out through a pit in her stomach and the void rush in.</p>
<p>“You’re sure?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Ryoka.”</p>
<p>There was too much sympathy in the [Receptionist]’s eyes. She’d seen this before, told other Runners the same thing, Ryoka knew. She hated that. She hated…it couldn’t be true.</p>
<p>“Bandits did it. [Bandits]? How could they get him? Valceif was—he was a <em>Courier.</em> He could outrun a horse!”</p>
<p>“They used magic. When they were captured, the surviving bandits said that they’d used a [Sleep] spell on the road. Apparently they took him unawares, before he knew they were there. It’s rare that a Courier doesn’t have magical items to ward against such spells, but—”</p>
<p>Ryoka’s hand had gone over her mouth when the woman mentioned the [Sleep] spell. When the [Receptionist] got to the part about magical items Ryoka threw up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone got Ryoka a towel and some water to wash her mouth out with. Ryoka stared at her hands as she sat at a table.</p>
<p>“It was my fault. I got him killed.”</p>
<p>There was a gasp. The [Receptionist]’s eyes flicked to the young man and other woman hovering around Ryoka. She glared at them.</p>
<p>“You didn’t hear that. Either of you. If I hear a word out of your mouths—”</p>
<p>They fled. Ryoka raised her head to stare at the [Receptionist].</p>
<p>“Why bother hiding it? It’s true. Valceif—he had—he had an amulet. A dreamcatcher that could shield him from spells. He gave it to me and I broke it. If I hadn’t—”</p>
<p>“I understand. But you must not say that openly.”</p>
<p>The woman stared at Ryoka.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because Valceif had friends. And family. And they might come here seeking vengeance if they hear the wrong things. Rumor would spin you as his murderer.”</p>
<p>“I might as well be. I killed him. I did it. I let him run off without protection—”</p>
<p>“Listen to me.”</p>
<p>The [Receptionist] tapped Ryoka’s arm, making the younger woman look up at her. There was kindness in the other woman’s gaze, but something made of steel as well.</p>
<p>“Valceif Godfrey was a Runner. He was a Courier—one of the best of us. He knew the risks of running without an artifact and he took it. His death was not your fault. He helped you because that is what we Runners do. The people who killed him are at fault, not you. Runners carry deliveries, but we do not bear grudges. We run and die and help each other. Valceif was a true Runner to the end.”</p>
<p>Ryoka stared at the [Receptionist].</p>
<p>“You were a Runner?”</p>
<p>The woman’s mouth turned up slightly.</p>
<p>“City Runner. Like you. I grew too old and slow for it. It’s too dangerous and I have a child. But I know what it’s like. I’ve lost friends too. Valceif probably thought he could outrun any mage before he bought another charm, but he made a mistake. That’s always how it happens. A small mistake or bad luck.”</p>
<p>Ryoka shuddered.</p>
<p>“But if—”</p>
<p>She paused and shook her head.</p>
<p>“I know. I know I couldn’t have known. But if—”</p>
<p>“If you could have, you would. But it was just bad luck.”</p>
<p>The two sat in silence for longer than Ryoka knew. Time lost its meaning for a while, but no one came over to bother the [Receptionist] and she ignored the queue at the desks.</p>
<p>After a while, the [Receptionist] thought she heard a voice. She looked at Ryoka, but saw nothing. It was a faint sound, almost indistinct. Then the woman saw a blue creature, a being of frost and ice standing by her ear. She stared at the Frost Faerie, but Ivolethe just whispered into Ryoka’s ear, quietly.</p>
<p>Time passed. All three sat in silence, then, Ivolethe sitting on Ryoka’s shoulder stared dreamily upwards. She did not weep, but there was something deep in the faerie’s eyes. A hint of forever. At last, Ryoka stood up.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to go. Thank you.”</p>
<p>The faerie darted towards her pouch and the [Receptionist] stood. She didn’t comment about Ivolethe, just walked with Ryoka to the doors.</p>
<p>“Come back if you need to.”</p>
<p>“I will.”</p>
<p>Slowly, Ryoka left the Runner’s Guild. All the energy she’d had before, all the excitement, was gone. She felt numb and hollow, and she remembered the feeling. She’d known it before.</p>
<p>Too many times. But this time Ryoka didn’t give into the feeling or allow it to overtake her. That was a luxury for later. Right now she walked and then jogged down the street, feeling as though she were shot or stabbed while she moved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The man at the desk in the Mage’s Guild was only too happy to show Ryoka the many messages left for her. In truth, they were all short slips of paper, [Message] spells being far too expensive for long missives, but there were a lot of them.</p>
<p>Ryoka stood at the counter, aware of the man’s eyes on her as she flipped through message after message. Quite a few were from Krshia, asking when she would come back.</p>
<p><em>There is unrest. You must return soon. Do you have what is needed?</em></p>
<p>Ryoka remembered the book full of spells in her bag of holding. Another promise, long delayed. She shook her head and read the next piece of parchment.</p>
<p>This one was from Ceria.</p>
<p><em>…hope you can reply soon. Let us know. We hope all is well.</em></p>
<p>They must have been worried without a response for days. Ryoka felt something else stab into her heart, but it was already bleeding so it hurt only a bit.</p>
<p>The next message was from Pisces and more direct.</p>
<p><em>What’s taking so long?</em></p>
<p>Just that. Ryoka sighed and took the next bit of parchment out. She read it and froze. It was from Lyonette.</p>
<p><em>Come back. Mrsha misses you.</em></p>
<p>The void in Ryoka’s heart didn’t shrink, but now she could feel it hurting. She thought of Mrsha. How long had it been since she’d seen her? She’d just run off, looking for Erin—but Erin had come back and Ryoka hadn’t.</p>
<p>“I have to go back.”</p>
<p>The bored man at the desk looked up, but Ryoka’s eyes were on the pieces of paper. She pulled a lengthy one out from Erin and almost smiled at it.</p>
<p>“Excuse me.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss? How can I help you?”</p>
<p>The man covered a sigh as Ryoka pulled out a bag of coins.</p>
<p>“I need to send a message to all these people in Liscor. Can you post an open response or something?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. What would you like to send?”</p>
<p>The man had a silver-tipped quill ready. He paused over a piece of parchment as Ryoka closed her eyes.</p>
<p>“Tell them I’m sorry. And I’ll be home soon.”</p>
<p>The man paused, and coughed.</p>
<p>“Do you mean for me to write ‘tell them I’m sorry’ or—”</p>
<p>Ryoka glared at him.</p>
<p>“No. Write ‘I’m sorry. I will return home soon’. That’s the general response. Now—I have specific messages I want sent to Erin Solstice, Krshia Silverfang, Ceria Springwalker, and…one for Mrsha, to be delivered to any of the people I just mentioned.”</p>
<p>The Mage’s Guild hired only those who could write as fast as other people talked. The man neatly wrote down each of the recipients as Ryoka mentioned them. Ryoka stared at his quill blurring over the parchment.</p>
<p>“Oh, and I want the messages sent right now. Yes, I’ll pay extra.”</p>
<p>The man coughed as Ryoka slapped down coins on the counter.</p>
<p>“Very well. May I have the first message, please?”</p>
<p>“Right. This one’s for Ceria.”</p>
<p>Ryoka closed her eyes and thought. Then she began speaking.</p>
<p>“This is Ryoka. I have had the items analyzed. Contents are as follows: magical sword, strong enchantment. Second sword: damaged beyond repair. Useless. Dagger—flame enchantment. Useful. Buckler: damaged but can be repaired. May have to sell one item to repair the rest…”</p>
<p>Her voice was low, but clear and precise. Ryoka dictated her message for Ceria, and then Krshia, and then left a message for Mrsha before pondering how to reply to Erin’s question. She thought about what she needed to get done in the city before she left, what she could say to Laken, and what to do about the magical items that Hedault was keeping for her.</p>
<p>It was hard, very hard. Every two seconds Ryoka remembered a grinning face, and a man who ran past her. She remembered his back, and the burning air in her lungs as she tried to keep up.</p>
<p>Just for a moment. It had just been a few days, but she had liked him. Ryoka closed her eyes as her breath caught in her chest, and the man at the desk looked up expectantly. But Valceif was dead. She’d mourn him later. Right now, she had a job to do. She had people counting on her, and Ryoka couldn’t let them down as well.</p>
<p>Slowly, painfully, Ryoka got back to work.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The word that travelled north was brief, but noteworthy. Amid the surge and ebb of tensions among the city-states and local aristocracy, it stood out.</p>
<p>Around the city of Liscor that marked the sole safe passage between the northern and southern parts of Izril, news was seldom good. The Goblin Lord was only the most recent of bad tidings; the Human cities were always facing some minor crisis. After all, they bordered not only the ill-tempered Drake lands, but the High Passes, from which bands of monsters occasionally emerged to wreak havoc.</p>
<p>In addition, the city-states that far south were far newer and less well-developed than their northern counterparts. Celum was a far cry from a northern city like Rectes, let alone a major hub like Invrisil.</p>
<p>But the whisper that came north by mage [Message] was hopeful. It was a simple line that made those in the know sit up:</p>
<p>Esthelm has risen.</p>
<p>Esthelm has returned.</p>
<p>Esthelm is not dead.</p>
<p>The city lives. The people rebuild the walls, and pledge to stay and fight rather than give way to the Goblin Lord’s armies. It was a small miracle, but what was far more miraculous was hearing where this sudden surge of life and hope had come from.</p>
<p>Esthelm had received aid…from Liscor of all places! No, not just Liscor—the <em>Antinium</em> of all species had come to help them. And somehow, Celum had sent a convoy down the roads without it falling prey to the Goblin armies.</p>
<p>Such boldness from the southern cities and generosity from the Antinium and Drakes was unprecedented. But with this, Esthelm might well recover and survive another Goblin assault and the remaining winter.</p>
<p>For a few seconds, hope blossomed in the cold. But just as quickly as it had been heard, the news of Esthelm would pass from the minds of all but a few listeners. Oh, some [Merchants] would mark down Esthelm as a prime target for business in the future if it survived, and a bold [Trader] might calculate the odds of making it to the city alive with a caravan, but no one else would pay attention to such news.</p>
<p>Almost no one. In fact, only two individuals of note paid attention to the news of Esthelm, despite their urgent business. The most powerful [Lady] on the continent listened to the news of the city’s revival and wondered, and the most infamous [Lord] frowned and adjusted his plans slightly to account for this discrepancy.</p>
<p>And then they too returned to business. Esthelm was put out of mind and the world continued to move onwards. Just for a moment though, it had shone brightly for all to see. For a moment, the world had stopped and stared at the small spark glowing there.</p>
<p>And who had lit the spark? It was a conflagration of many hands and claws it was true, but the young woman from which it had all started was a young [Innkeeper]. She dozed lightly as a wagon trundled down the road back to Liscor just before dawn. It was far too early for such a trip she felt, but the roads were clear, and Termin had wanted to go now.</p>
<p>“After all, that second army of Goblins has been raiding and burnt down a town not fifty miles north of here. If I’m moving my wagon, it’s with a convoy or clear roads or not at all.”</p>
<p>Thus, he’d persuaded the reluctant Erin to ride back with him to Liscor, escorted by the Horns of Hammerad as before. They lay asleep in the back of the wagon, exhausted from a day of work.</p>
<p>More traffic would soon flow south to Liscor. The majority of wagons would head back, as would the Gold-rank adventurers, Zel Shivertail, and a good portion of the Antinium who’d come north.</p>
<p>Only a day had passed since Esthelm had received aid. That was too short a time to effect that much change, although the Antinium had managed to repair a good deal of the walls themselves. But the convoy had done its job, and staying longer would do no good. Extra hands to help meant extra mouths to feed, and the food and supplies that had been brought would go to waste that way.</p>
<p>So the adventurers who had been hired would stay, the extra [Guardsmen], [Hunters], [Healers], and so on would lend their expertise, and a group of Antinium Workers and Soldiers under Anand’s supervision would stay to complete construction work. Everyone else would leave.</p>
<p>That suited Erin just fine. She woke up a bit as the cold air blew into her face. But after adjusting her head so she was sheltered by the wagon’s sides, she dozed off.</p>
<p>Woke up again. This time Erin saw Liscor in the distance. She blinked around blearily and decided a few more minutes wouldn’t hurt…</p>
<p>“Miss Erin? We’re here.”</p>
<p>A hand shook Erin gently. She groaned and then opened her eyes.</p>
<p>The wagon was parked right next to the hill the inn stood on. Erin looked at Termin, and realized he’d stopped here for her.</p>
<p>“Oh, thanks, Termin!”</p>
<p>He smiled at her, and dipped his head slightly.</p>
<p>“My pleasure.”</p>
<p>There was much more to say, but it was too early. Erin got up and woke up the other Horns of Hammerad by yanking the blankets off them. They swore at her—Ceria nearly hit Erin with her skeletal hand before she opened her eyes. But they did get up.</p>
<p>It was customary to tip drivers, even if they had been paid. Erin fished around for a coin but Termin waved her away.</p>
<p>“Treat me to a meal tonight, miss. You’ll be open? Then I’ll be there.”</p>
<p>He gently flapped the reins and Erma and Fox began to plod off.</p>
<p>“Bastard. It’s not a minute’s travel up the hill.”</p>
<p>Pisces glared at the wagon as it rolled through the snow. Erin glared blearily at him, shivering already despite the blanket she’d draped around her shoulders for extra protection.</p>
<p>“That’s a lot of work for his horses. We can walk. Come on.”</p>
<p>Silently, the adventurers trudged up the hill after Erin. She pushed open the door to her inn and they practically fell down the steps to the basement. Erin paused only to make sure they had enough blankets. Everyone but Ksmvr was already back asleep.</p>
<p>Silently, Erin wandered over to the fireplace and added a few logs that had been piled up next to it. The glowing embers set fire to the wood as she blew carefully at it.</p>
<p>The ash made her cough. Erin took a few steps back and stared as the temperature in the common room began to rise. She glanced towards the window.</p>
<p>It was still night. But there was light there, too. It would be dawn soon.</p>
<p>If she were back home, Erin would have been dead asleep—or going to sleep if she’d pulled another all-nighter playing chess online or studying games. She would have never contemplated anything remotely resembling hard work at this hour, and probably would have slept in till one.</p>
<p>“Huh. I guess I’m a morning person now.”</p>
<p>Erin smiled, and bowed her head as she shivered and sat at an empty table in her inn. She closed her eyes, but that was a mistake.</p>
<p>Yes, if she were back home, she’d be lying in bed with her laptop, covered with blankets as the snow fell outside. Maybe she would be thinking about getting a part-time job, or what college would be like next year. She’d be studying chess or chatting online with a friend and—</p>
<p><em>Memory.</em></p>
<p>It hurt. Erin bit her lip, so hard she nearly punctured skin. She stood up and sighed. Swaying on her feet, Erin frowned. She was still waking up.</p>
<p>“…not now. But it’s Christmas time. Time…?”</p>
<p>The mumbling attracted attention. Erin heard the creak of someone descending the stairs and saw Lyonette rubbing her eyes as she walked down. The young woman froze when she saw Erin standing in the center of the room, but then she relaxed.</p>
<p>“Oh. I thought—”</p>
<p>Erin nodded at her. Lyonette silently stumbled down the steps. Both girls stood in the room, staring at each other. Without saying anything, a consensus was reached that it was far too early for anything resembling conversation.</p>
<p>Erin sat back down. Then she stood up with a groan and went into the kitchen to prepare food for the masses. Lyonette went outside with a bucket for water.</p>
<p>Some things were easiest to do on autopilot. Erin mechanically made crepes in a batter and fried them up. She was munching on a buttery crepe before she properly woke up. The hot food was burning her hands, but it was food so she didn’t care.</p>
<p>The sun was coming up. Now Erin could think, she wandered back into the common room, leaving a heap of crepes in a bowl covered with a towel. They could always be reheated, and she had too much work to do to stay in the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Time to get to work.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Lyonette paused mid-bite, a piece of crepe halfway towards her mouth. She blinked blearily at Erin. The young woman waved at her [Barmaid].</p>
<p>“I said I’m going to work. A lot. Today’s going to be busy, Lyon. I think you’ll have to stay in the inn most of the time, but I’ll be running around like a chicken with its head cut off.”</p>
<p>The young woman sitting at the table nodded. She paused, frowned, and woke up a bit more. Then she thought about what Erin had said.</p>
<p>“Do they actually do that?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Chickens. Do they really run around when you…I mean, if you…”</p>
<p>Lyonette gulped. Erin paused.</p>
<p>“Maybe? I dunno, I’ve never actually tried it. It’s just what people say where I come from.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>The two girls stared at each other. After a second, Erin coughed.</p>
<p>“We don’t do that <em>all</em> the time. It’s just…”</p>
<p>“No, I understand.”</p>
<p>“Right. Well then…I’m off to the city!”</p>
<p>Awkwardly, Erin edged out the door. She came back in to grab a money pouch and fill it with coins. She was feeling the rush of sugar and adrenaline now. She put a smile on her face and fixed it there.</p>
<p>“Do we need anything, Lyon? I mean, Lyonette?”</p>
<p>“Um. Lyon’s fine I guess. We need some more flour, a few tomatoes if you want to make that ‘cats-up’ stuff, and some salt. I think we’ve got enough for tonight.”</p>
<p>“Alright, got it! Oh, and one more thing—”</p>
<p>Erin poked her head back through the door. Lyonette looked at her expectantly.</p>
<p>“Christmas is coming.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“It’s a holiday! Everyone’s going to get presents and have fun, so…think of some gifts for people, okay? You’ll have to get presents for uh, two other people. It can be food, something small or fun or anything like that. Just think of something nice to give someone else.”</p>
<p>“Okay?”</p>
<p>“Thanks! I’ll explain the rest later!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was just a smile, but Erin wore it like a shield. Smiling helped. Smiling made you think the day might not be horrible after all. Not that she thought today <em>would</em> be horrible, but she had a lot to do, and she was going to do it cheerful or she’d kill herself.</p>
<p>Or someone. Like the sleepy guardsman at the gate. The Drake on duty just stared at Erin as she stood outside the closed gates. After five minutes he managed to get them open enough for her to slip through.</p>
<p>“I have so much to do!”</p>
<p>Erin groused to herself as she stomped across the streets of Liscor, trying not to slip on the snow-covered paving stones. There was practically no one up yet, but she found Market Street at least partially occupied. While pedestrians had yet to hit the streets, the shopkeepers were setting up, miserably trying to stay warm while they opened their stalls.</p>
<p>Erin found one familiar Gnoll grumbling to herself as she dusted snow off of her counter with a paw. Krshia Silverfang turned before Erin could call out to her. The Gnoll sniffed and smiled as Erin approached her small stall.</p>
<p>“Krshia!”</p>
<p>The young woman beamed at her. The Gnoll smiled and beckoned Erin closer. They huddled beneath her stall’s flimsy walls from the wind while they chatted.</p>
<p>“Erin Solstice. It has been far, far too long since we have spoken properly, yes?”</p>
<p>“Yes! How are you doing, Krshia? I know we talked a bit at the party, but there’s so much that has happened!”</p>
<p>“Indeed. We must catch up. But first—have you business with me?”</p>
<p>“I do! Here—oh wait, I don’t have a list. But I know what I need.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Let me fetch a piece of parchment and charcoal, yes?”</p>
<p>Erin chatted with Krshia as the Gnoll wrote down her shopping list and told her it would be delivered to her inn by the end of the day. Erin put a few coins on the table and got three bronze coins in change. Then she took a deep breath and got to the real reason she’d sought Krshia out so early.</p>
<p>“Krshia, I know Lyonette’s um…well, I know she did a lot of things while I was gone.”</p>
<p>“That is so. Hrm. You say you have done much in Celum while you were away, yes? Well, Lyonette has…also done much here.”</p>
<p>Erin peeked up at the tall Gnoll’s face. Krshia’s expression was hard to read, but her ears weren’t flat. That was a good sign.</p>
<p>“I know you didn’t want her back in the city. But she came in, didn’t she?”</p>
<p>Krshia paused, and her ears did <em>twitch</em> then. But her voice remained level and calm. Or seemingly calm.</p>
<p>“She was allowed back in the city by Zel Shivertail, no? What is a Gnoll’s pride before the famous hero of the Antinium Wars? We will do nothing to her, not when the Council is against us.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. But she came back to—”</p>
<p>“Save the child Mrsha. I know. It makes it better, no?”</p>
<p>“No. Well, yes. Maybe. But she only did it because of that. She won’t come back otherwise. And I had a chat with her, and…well, she’s sorry and she’ll try to make amends.”</p>
<p>“So I have seen. But her debt is large, Erin.”</p>
<p>“I know. I just wanted to say that she’s going to try and stay out of the city unless it’s an emergency. And a bit of the money she gets paid—once I actually pay her—will go to you for your shop. It’s not much, but it’s what she can do. What I can do.”</p>
<p>Krshia blinked down at Erin. She didn’t immediately reply. Erin shivered.</p>
<p>“I know it’s not enough. But she’s trying, okay?”</p>
<p>“Hrm. I understand.”</p>
<p>Krshia shook her head. She looked tired as she flicked a bit of snow that had dared to land on her counter off onto the ground.</p>
<p>“That Human child is odd. Odd, but I see her trying. It is not enough, but it will do. Let us not talk of such things, Erin. You have just returned—again. Let us talk of good matters, or as much good as there is on such cold days.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Erin smiled at Krshia and saw the Gnoll bare her canines in response. After a second, Erin frowned.</p>
<p>“Krshia, what’s the Council? That’s the group that rules Liscor, right? Who are they? I’ve never seen them.”</p>
<p>The Gnoll shrugged. She glanced hopefully up and down the street, but Erin was her only customer. A few Drakes were starting on one end of the street, but it would be several minutes before they got to her.</p>
<p>“The Council is made up of important people in the city. It is a Drake thing. The foremost people sit on it and decide what must be done from time to time.”</p>
<p>“Really, who are they?”</p>
<p>Another shrug. Krshia frowned a bit as she replied, which made Erin think that Gnolls didn’t get much of a place on the Council.</p>
<p>“The head of the Adventurer’s Guild, the foremost [Mage], usually head of the Mage’s Guild…hrm, the Captain of the Watch, Zevara, the head of the Merchant’s Guild…Olesm…”</p>
<p>“<em>Olesm!?</em>”</p>
<p>“He is chief [Tactician] in the city. He must advise on matters that may be military. He has a voice.”</p>
<p>“Wow. I had no idea he was actually that important!”</p>
<p>“Well, it is a civilian council. While the army is away they leave such people in charge. You know Liscor’s army is a mercenary one? They are a power unto their own, but they rarely return to the city.”</p>
<p>“Huh.”</p>
<p>Erin thought about that for a second. Then she stared at Krshia. The Gnoll wasn’t shivering, but she looked miserable, standing in her small stall waiting for customers as the snow fell down again.</p>
<p>Miserable. Perhaps it was her stall. It was too small. Erin remembered how it had looked before, how many wares Krshia had had on display. Now…</p>
<p>“I’m sorry about your shop. Did I say that before? I’m really sorry about it. I know it was hard—and I’d like to help if I can.”</p>
<p>Krshia blinked at Erin and shook her head.</p>
<p>“You say it as if it was your fault. It is not.”</p>
<p>“But I need to say it. I hired Lyonette, and I know you were upset. It must be so hard—if I can do anything, I will. That’s what friends are for.”</p>
<p>The [Shopkeeper] just shook her head.</p>
<p>“I must have new wares to sell, and that costs money. To sell I must buy, and I have less coin than I did. My friends in the city and those from my tribe aid me. They lend me coin and I buy and sell with that. It is enough. It is not as if you can give me more business—unless there is something like those hamburgers I may sell?”</p>
<p>She looked inquiringly at Erin, but without any real hope. Erin hesitated, and then smiled.</p>
<p>“I do have some ideas. Maybe not things I can make, but—I’ll try.”</p>
<p>“It is all I ask, yes? But where does this spirit come from?”</p>
<p>“I did a lot of thinking. Well, mostly on the wagon ride to Esthelm and back. I think I can help, and not just by giving you a bunch of coin or anything. I just—I want to make sure my friends are doing okay. Which reminds me, where’s Brunkr? I heard he was sick from Klbkch!”</p>
<p>Krshia paused. She had been smiling a bit at Erin. Now the smile vanished into the cold.</p>
<p>“My nephew? He is poor. He rests in my home, Erin. He will…be better after he gains the courage to do what must be done, I think.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>Krshia looked uncomfortable. She shook her head and glanced around the street.</p>
<p>“Better if you see for yourself. I would let him explain or you see, but not say it. Hrr. Perhaps there is time before more come to shop. Would you like to see?”</p>
<p>Erin hesitated. Krshia was clearly upset. If she wasn’t saying…</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>It was a quick walk to Krshia’s apartment. Erin opened the door and recognized the cozy home. Nothing much had changed since her last visit, save for what looked like a heap of rugs on Krshia’s couch. Then someone groaned and the pile of rugs turned into Brunkr, wrapped up in blankets as he lay in Krshia’s home.</p>
<p>“Brunkr? I have come back, yes? And brought someone to visit.”</p>
<p>Krshia spoke quietly to Brunkr. He made no reply. He was lying with the blanket wrapped around his huge frame. Something stank horribly. Erin made a face and suppressed the urge to gag. She peered at Brunkr, but couldn’t see anything, cocooned as he was.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with him?”</p>
<p>“Go away, Human.”</p>
<p>Brunkr’s voice was muffled but distinct. She saw him roll and then two dark brown eyes glared malevolently at her.</p>
<p>“Leave me, Erin Solstice. And take your cursed doombringer far away from me. Leave her yourself unless you wish to end up as I do.”</p>
<p>Doombringer? Erin frowned and then realized he meant Mrsha. Krshia frowned at Brunkr.</p>
<p>“Nephew! Be silent. Do not blame bad luck on the Mrsha child.”</p>
<p>Brunkr ignored his aunt. He sat up with an effort, groaning as his legs slowly unfolded and he shifted the blanket. The smell grew worse. It was the smell of…Erin’s stomach roiled and the crepes threatened to come up. The Gnoll warrior was breathing heavily and sweat was staining his fur as she stared at Krshia.</p>
<p>“Is it time to cut it off? Is that why you have come?”</p>
<p>“Cut? Cut what off?”</p>
<p>Erin blinked at Brunkr. He stared incredulously at her, and then snarled. He tore off the blanket from his frame and thrust his right hand at her.</p>
<p>Both Human and Gnoll recoiled. Erin saw yellow dripping pus, oozing around red broken skin covered in horribly stained fur—in an instant she realized where the smell was coming from. The blanket Brunkr had tossed to the floor was also covered in dried yellow gunk.</p>
<p>It was horrible. And disgusting. Erin swallowed hard and forced her stomach to stay still.</p>
<p>“What’s that? How did you…?”</p>
<p>“Your cursed one <em>bit </em>me.”</p>
<p>Brunkr snarled at Erin. He cradled his hand, unable to touch it as more yellow pus dripped slowly out of the infected injury on his arm. Erin couldn’t look away from the horrible sight.</p>
<p>Whatever Mrsha had done, and Erin vaguely recalled her biting Brunkr only a bit, that small injury had turned into a full-scale infection that had taken over a good portion of Brunkr’s forearm. It was horrible, and clearly not healing.</p>
<p>“That’s bad.”</p>
<p>Both Brunkr and Krshia stared at Erin. She gulped again.</p>
<p>“That’s real bad. Um, Brunkr. Mrsha did this? Have you—I mean, I’m sorry, but she didn’t mean to do that. Have you had that looked at by a [Healer]? Or gotten a healing potion or something? If you need to, I can pay for—”</p>
<p>The male Gnoll made a sound of fury and turned away violently. Krshia pulled at Erin’s arm and whispered to her as the two stood by the door.</p>
<p>“It is not something curable with a healing potion, and the [Healers] cannot fix such an injury, Erin. Not ones from Liscor—and not ones from Celum, I fear. It is too far infected now. Only magic might save it, and few know healing spells for this.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Oh no.”</p>
<p>Erin didn’t know what to say. She understood the problem. Maybe Brunkr would be okay in her world, but here a healing potion and [Healer] were the only types of medicine available. And neither one was specialized in fighting diseases or infections.</p>
<p>“It is my doom, brought upon me. It will fall on the rest of you as well.”</p>
<p>Brunkr stood in a corner, holding his arm, not looking at the other two. He had heard every word they had said with his acute hearing.</p>
<p>His arm. It was a ghastly sight, but Erin couldn’t look away for some reason. She kept waiting for Brunkr to turn so she could stare at it again.</p>
<p>Her right hand twinged. Erin stared down at it, and remembered a similar sight. She looked at Krshia questioningly.</p>
<p>“Back when my hand was all cut up Klbkch gave me a healing potion. It worked, even though it was sort of infected. Are you sure a healing potion—a good one—wouldn’t…?”</p>
<p>Krshia shook her head instantly.</p>
<p>“Light infections, perhaps. The body will fight it off in the end, yes? So a healing potion makes it faster. But deep rot such as this…no. It will only speed up the infection.”</p>
<p>“So what can you do?”</p>
<p>Krshia didn’t reply. But she stared at Brunkr and Erin saw the Gnoll’s entire body tense up. Erin went pale.</p>
<p>“No. Really?”</p>
<p>“He must—”</p>
<p>“No! Not yet!”</p>
<p>Brunkr’s voice was full of anguish. He bent over his hand, making a sound that was more animal than word. Erin saw Krshia staring at her younger nephew with deep sorrow—but also something cold in her gaze.</p>
<p>“It must be soon, nephew. Erin, even she can see your hand is gone, yes?”</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>The echo came from Erin’s mouth. Both Gnolls stared at her, Brunkr turning his head to look. Erin was shaking her head.</p>
<p>“No, Erin Solstice? But you see his hand. It must go or the rot will consume him as well.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s—maybe something can be done. Krshia, let me—I think something can be done.”</p>
<p>“Truly?”</p>
<p>“Impossible!”</p>
<p>Brunkr snapped at Erin, showing his teeth. Erin felt her heart beating faster, but not from fear. She stared at Brunkr’s hand and thought of doctors, hospitals. She had no idea—only a vague recollection of taking tablets and getting shots, but maybe…</p>
<p>“Let me try to help, okay? I think I have an idea. I’ll come back—”</p>
<p>“Do not lie to me, Human.”</p>
<p>Brunkr glared at Erin, seemingly more infuriated by her offer to help than his aunt’s words. Erin held her ground as he stumbled towards her. Brunkr’s voice was slurred by pain and grief, but he was still a warrior of a Gnoll tribe. He towered over her as he glared and Erin saw Krshia staring warily at her nephew.</p>
<p>“Humans—hrr. I hear Humans say try and give up in an instant. What can you do that my tribe—my aunt cannot? Can you save my hand? Tell me. If you lie, I will know.”</p>
<p>“I can try.”</p>
<p>Erin looked Brunkr in the eye. He stared at her. The anger was replaced by dull resignation in an instant.</p>
<p>“You will fail, and say you did all you could. Your words are empty.”</p>
<p>“I don’t give up that easily. Here.”</p>
<p>Erin stepped past Brunkr, to a pile of rags that smelled horrible. She found a bucket of water and washed the rags briskly as Krshia guided Brunkr back to the couch. Erin wrung the cloth and pressed it on Brunkr’s head. The Gnoll groaned and lay back. Erin turned to Krshia and silently the two females left her apartment.</p>
<p>“If you can help, I will give all to save his hand. But is it possible?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I don’t know, Krshia, but I know who I can ask.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“Ryoka.”</p>
<p>That was all they said on the matter. Back at Krshia’s stall, Erin stood in front of it, feeling heavier than she had when she’d just woken up. She couldn’t get the image of Brunkr’s infected hand out of her head.</p>
<p>Krshia seemed equally weighed down, despite Erin’s assurances. She looked so <em>tired.</em> It hurt Erin’s heart. The girl cast around for something, anything that could make the Gnoll feel better, and then remembered one of the things she had decided to do. She put a smile on her face and made it stick by sheer force of will.</p>
<p>Lighthearted tone. Erin took a breath and did her best.</p>
<p>“I know Brunkr’s in bad shape, but can I tell you about something that’s going to happen a few days from now, Krshia?”</p>
<p>“Hm? What is this thing, Erin Solstice?”</p>
<p>Krshia eyed Erin as the girl tried to summon the powers of the holiday spirit. She spread her arms.</p>
<p>“Christmas! I know you don’t know what that is, but listen. Back where I come from…back from my world, we have a tradition. Every year, in the winter, just before the new year starts, we celebrate Christmas.”</p>
<p>“Hrm. The shortest day of the year, the winter solstice is yet a few days away. Before this is Christmas, you say? What happens on this day?”</p>
<p>“We celebrate. We give each other presents, eat lots of food—oh, and Santa Claus comes to give things to everyone!”</p>
<p>The Gnoll just stared at Erin. The girl tried to explain. She got most of the points across, although Krshia still didn’t understand why a fat man would run around with presents and coal to give to everyone. But the Gnoll <em>was</em> smiling when Erin had finished.</p>
<p>“So you intend to celebrate this—this day of giving soon?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Tomorrow, maybe? Or the day after? I know there’s not a lot of time to get gifts, but we can all try, right? But we have to do it <em>before</em> the new year’s. That’s very important. So…do you want to join in? I’m going to have everyone give gifts to two people so everyone gets presents. We’ll have a huge party at my inn and everything!”</p>
<p>Erin held her breath as Krshia thought about the idea. The Gnoll rubbed her face with a furry paw, and then smiled again.</p>
<p>“Christmas. Yes, it could be a nice thing to do. And I must give gifts to two others? Whom? Or will it be a surprise?”</p>
<p>Erin hesitated.</p>
<p>“I think that could get weird. I’ll come up with a list and tell everyone who their people are. I’ll uh, also make sure you don’t get Lyonette and she doesn’t get you. I guess I should keep Klbkch and Zel from being Secret Santas too.”</p>
<p>“Hrm. That may be wise, yes.”</p>
<p>Krshia bared her teeth in a smile. Erin smiled back.</p>
<p>“Okay. I’ve got to go. But I’ll be back. And—I’ll be back.”</p>
<p>“I know. Go safely, Erin. And have a merry…Christmas, yes?”</p>
<p>“Yeah!”</p>
<p>The girl waved and hurried off down the street. Krshia watched her go, and then sighed. The thought of her nephew was like a burden on her, a heavy stone. But somehow, she thought of it differently now. She managed to smile, and perhaps it was that which attracted a middle-aged Drake across the street to Krshia’s stall.</p>
<p>The Gnoll smiled wider, and began to talk with the Drake. Perhaps she was only there for a chat, but Krshia thought she could smell an opportunity here.</p>
<p>“Hello, Tesha. Have you heard of an interesting Human tradition? No? It is called ‘Christmas’. I tell you because it is coming soon, and you may wish to buy presents if you wish to partake. You see, on Christmas…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So much to do, and so little time. Erin was trying to figure out which street to go down when she saw a familiar face and scales in the crowd. She called out at once.</p>
<p>“Olesm!”</p>
<p>“Erin? I was just going to see if you were back!”</p>
<p>The Drake beamed at her. They stopped in the middle of the street, the vapor trails of their conversation floating upwards as they talked and shivered.</p>
<p>“How are you, Olesm? We barely talked before—Lyonette says you were a huge help to her while I was gone. Thank you so much!”</p>
<p>“Aw, it was nothing—well, actually, it was sort of hard.”</p>
<p>Olesm frowned as he nudged Erin. They stood aside to let a grumpy Drake wearing armor and a group of other armed Drakes stomp by. The Drake wearing the most impressive regalia snorted as he saw Erin talking with Olesm.</p>
<p>“Humans.”</p>
<p>He passed by and Olesm shook his head.</p>
<p>“Sorry—what was I saying? Oh yeah, I was happy to help Lyonette. But it’s a good thing she managed to patch things up with the Gnolls so they’d deliver to her. My arms nearly fell off trying to haul all the food she wanted up to the inn every day! I don’t know how you do it!”</p>
<p>“You get strong. See?”</p>
<p>Erin tried to flex her arm to show Olesm, but all the clothes on her body made that futile. Olesm smiled and then fidgeted.</p>
<p>“I don’t suppose you’re free right now, Erin? I’d love to chat with you—I mean, there’s so much I’ve been meaning to show you, and I’d love to play a game if…”</p>
<p>Erin sighed and Olesm’s face fell.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Olesm. But I’m so busy! I have to go to the Mage’s Guild after this, and then…”</p>
<p>“I completely understand. I’ll ask again later.”</p>
<p>Olesm raised his claws and made to back away. Erin felt a pang as she saw how disappointed he was—and how hard he was trying to hide that fact.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you come to the inn after lunch? I’ll definitely have time to talk then. We can play a few games of chess and—oh, I can show you how to play Shogi!”</p>
<p>The blue-scaled Drake paused. His tail began to wag hopefully in the snow.</p>
<p>“Really? You mean it? I won’t be interrupting?”</p>
<p>“I’ll make time. It’s a promise, okay? After lunch. You can make it, right?”</p>
<p>“I’ll be there! No problem! Let me just—I’ll have to get my notes, and a bottle of fresh ink—and I can show you all the letters I’ve received. I’ll be there! At your inn, right? Definitely!”</p>
<p>Erin smiled as Olesm rushed off, practically jumping for joy. Then she frowned.</p>
<p>“After lunch? Gotta go faster, then.”</p>
<p>She stomped down the street, searching for the Mage’s Guild. In truth, Erin had never been there, but it wasn’t hard to find the place.</p>
<p>There wasn’t a line this early in the day, and the Drake at the counter was clearly bored. He didn’t seem any happier to have to serve anyone, but Erin gave him her best smile anyways.</p>
<p>“Hi there, you do messages by spell, right? Can I send a message to…Invrisil? How much would that cost, actually?”</p>
<p>The Drake stared at Erin, and grudgingly pointed his claw to a large sign with prices listed right above his head. Erin turned red and stared at them.</p>
<p>“Payment is up front. We don’t send packages by magic either; you’ll need to go to a Walled City or another city for that.”</p>
<p>The Drake’s voice was testy. Erin nodded a few times.</p>
<p>“Got it…not too pricy, huh. Okay, I think I’d like to send a message to my friend! Can I send it now, or do I have to wait?”</p>
<p>The Drake pointed to the sign again.</p>
<p>“There’s a fee for quick deliveries. Just tell me your friend’s name and I’ll have it addressed to her.”</p>
<p>Erin gave him Ryoka’s name, spelling it out for him as he frowned over the odd spelling, grumbling about Human names. Her message was simple, and was written verbatim.</p>
<p>“Hey Ryoka, this is Erin! I need help! I just spoke with Krshia—you know she’s got a nephew, Brunkr, right? Well, he’s got an infected hand and I was wondering—okay. Wow. That much? Um, Ryoka, lots of money to send this, so…how to heal infected hand? Also, when are you coming back? Christmas is soon. Come back soon!”</p>
<p>After that, Erin had to pay and wait for the [Clerk] to take the letter upstairs to the [Mage] on duty. She got a small receipt and her change—she was paying in gold coins since the Gold-rank adventurers didn’t seem to have smaller denominations.</p>
<p>Erin wondered if Ryoka would get the message. She was about to hurry back to her inn when the Drake at the desk suddenly called out after her.</p>
<p>“Miss? Miss Human!”</p>
<p>She came back to the counter. He was frowning at something that had just shot down a small tube from upstairs. It was a slip of parchment, folded up. He showed it to Erin.</p>
<p>“A reply just came back. It seems your friend has already received your message. She is at the Mage’s Guild in Invrisil this moment.”</p>
<p>“<em>What?</em>”</p>
<p>Erin stared at the [Clerk.]</p>
<p>“That’s a weird coincidence.”</p>
<p>He didn’t look as astounded as Erin felt.</p>
<p>“It happens. Normally we would take in her message with the rest as it comes in, but she paid to send a reply back fast.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Well then…can you tell Ryoka I’m here? Or do I have to send another message?”</p>
<p>The Drake paused. He looked reluctant to be awake, and more reluctant to have to speak with an uninformed customer, but Erin’s smile wore him down and he decided to be helpful.</p>
<p>“Why don’t I send a message requesting a two-way communication between you two?”</p>
<p>“Wow. You can do that? Thank you! But will it cost a lot?”</p>
<p>The Drake coughed, looking around the empty building.</p>
<p>“If you were paying for a mage to be on standby, yes. But it’s clear around here and I know Invrisil has mages to spare…we’ll deliver all your messages sent immediately for an upfront fee, and every message sent afterwards. It’s not cheap, but if you have the gold to spend you can get a reply right away.”</p>
<p>“In that case, let’s have a chat!”</p>
<p>Erin plonked gold coins on the counter and the Drake sighed only slightly before scribbling down on a bit of parchment. He had to talk to the [Mage] on duty—and then send a message to Invrisil to Ryoka and the people there. But in the end Erin found herself dictating responses to him and waiting for a response as Ryoka got messages back on her end and replied.</p>
<p>It was a thousand, no, ten thousand times worse than the most disjointed Skype call. Erin had to dictate a message to the [Clerk] and then wait for as many as ten minutes for a reply. She passed that time chatting with him and introducing the idea of Christmas to his world, but it was still arduous.</p>
<p>When all was transcribed and done, the conversation the [Clerk] had written down for Erin read like a chat session, albeit one marked down with ink on parchment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>[Erin] – </strong>Hi Ryoka! This is Erin! Are you okay? How are things? I’m in Liscor right now! The Horns of Hammerad brought me back! How’s Magnolia doing? What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>[Ryoka] – </strong>Don’t waste money. What’s this about infection? Describe. How bad; symptoms. Any complications on return?</p>
<p><strong>[Erin] – </strong>Sorry. No bad things! Met Teriarch—mean! Brunkr has tons of pus—yellow and stinky! Mrsha bit, now whole arm is bad! Krshia says choppy-chop. I say no! How to fix?</p>
<p><strong>[Ryoka] – </strong>Will talk T later. Brunkr needs antibiotics. Can’t heal with time; penicillin is best bet. Can tell how to make, but too slow. Chop might be only way, but must make sure new wound does not spread. Let me think. Wait for response.</p>
<p>The message looked like Ryoka had had to spell out penicillin letter by letter for the poor [Clerk] on duty. Erin had to wait eight minutes for the next response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>[Ryoka] – </strong>P recipe: needs to let mold grow. If you know origin—poultice. Must grow greenish-blue mold on orange or bread. But must isolate. Not all molds are P obviously. Very difficult; hire O to do it. In meantime, best bet is disinfection and honey.</p>
<p><strong>[Erin] – </strong>Honey? Really?</p>
<p><strong>[Ryoka] – </strong>Yes. Honey can have antibiotic if natural. Clean wound thoroughly. Use hot, salt water. Clean area, apply clean dressing. Think germs. Change dressings regularly. Honey must be applied after cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>[Erin] – </strong>Got it. Will try! And…new thought! What about matches?</p>
<p><strong>[Ryoka] – </strong>Matches? Why?</p>
<p><strong>[Erin] – </strong>Christmas! It’s Christmas soon! You must come back with presents! We will have party! Can you take carriage back? Tell Reynold he is invited too!</p>
<p><strong>[Ryoka] – </strong>Will try. Much to do here. Matches—talk O. Needs P from Periodic Table for striking box. Powdered glass, P…striker. Combine with sulfur and other things for match head. Other ingredients can figure out. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>[Erin] – </strong>Sort of. I know P from table!</p>
<p><strong>[Ryoka] – </strong>Red P. Not sure if discovered. See if O knows. May be substitute. For striking box, understand? Can use sandpaper maybe instead.</p>
<p><strong>[Erin] – </strong>Got it! When coming back?</p>
<p><strong>[Ryoka] – </strong>Unsure.</p>
<p><strong>[Erin] – </strong>Come, please! Party is in two days! Come for Christmas! Tell Magnolia she is Scrooge! Ressa is cool.</p>
<p><strong>[Ryoka] – </strong>Will try. Leaving now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Possibly there had never been such a confusing conversation for any [Clerk] to record. Both girls didn’t bother with grammar when delivering their messages and indeed, the only reason the words were spelled correctly was that the [Mages] couldn’t handle texting slang. Erin left the Drake at the desk with her money pouch lighter, but newfound hope in her heart. She strode out of the guild, muttering to herself and thinking fast.</p>
<p>“Penicillin, matches, and honey. I can get Lyonette to help with that, but Ryoka sure knows a lot. If she knows how matches work…hm…I should have asked about…wait, that gives me a great idea!”</p>
<p>Erin patted at her pockets, looking for something to write with, and then marched back inside the Mage’s Guild to borrow the [Clerk]’s quill for a second. She ended up going back to Krshia to buy an inkpot and ink.</p>
<p>It was hard to scribble on parchment and walk, and in the end Erin had to wait until she got back to the inn to write on the back of the piece of parchment. She’d already tripped once and stained quite a lot of snow black.</p>
<p>When Erin was hiking up towards her inn, she noticed a good deal more activity going on. That was confirmed by a ball of white fur that shot out the door as she got close.</p>
<p>“Hey Mrsha! I’m back! Whoops, don’t make me spill this on your fur. Let me just write this down…bicycle…there!”</p>
<p>Erin laughed, tried to fend off Mrsha, and get inside all at once. When she finally made it in, she saw that the Horns of Hammerad were up.</p>
<p>“Hey guys! Are the others not back yet?”</p>
<p>“They’re still on the road. But they should be back by tonight.”</p>
<p>Yvlon blinked at Erin, still looking tired. It was still early morning Erin realized. Everyone was having breakfast as Lyonette heated up Erin’s crepes.</p>
<p>Putting Mrsha on a table, Erin grabbed a crepe and devoured it with her gloves still on. Then she turned to Ceria.</p>
<p>“I just had a chat with Ryoka?”</p>
<p>“<em>You did?</em>”</p>
<p>All of the Horns of Hammerad sat up. Erin nodded as she gulped from a glass of water Mrsha rushed over to her. It was half-empty from being spilled as the Gnoll ran with it, but Erin appreciated the effort.</p>
<p>“I was talking with her! She was in Invrisil, and she sent me [Messages]! She’ll be back soon—in time for Christmas, I hope! She says she’s got messages for you too, Ceria! Apparently she identified all those items you found!”</p>
<p>“She <em>did?</em>”</p>
<p>The Horns of Hammerad were out of the door like a shot. Pisces only stopped long enough to grab as much food as he could hold; Yvlon, Ceria, and Ksmvr didn’t even wait to do that. Bemused, Erin stood aside and watched them storming down the hill, slipping and sliding in the snow. She could hear Ksmvr shouting after them as he brought up the rear.</p>
<p>“What is Christmas? Pisces, please ex—”</p>
<p>“Hey, Pisces moves really fast with that [Flash Step] spell. He can eat <em>and</em> outrun Ceria! Wish I could do that.”</p>
<p>Erin stared at the figures rushing towards Liscor. She shook her head and then turned. Mrsha and Lyonette were staring over the remains of the half-eaten breakfast. Erin smiled at both and then clapped her hands.</p>
<p>“Lyonette!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Erin?”</p>
<p>“I need more honey. And bees.”</p>
<p>“Honey? You mean—we have half a jar left.”</p>
<p>“I know, but I’ll need an extra jar for something special. You told me we can get it from the hive without Toren. Could you show me how you do that now, or is that no good?”</p>
<p>Lyonette hesitated. Her eyes went to Erin, and then the door. She hesitated, swallowed hard, and then stood straight and nodded.</p>
<p>“I can do it. Just give me an hour or two and I’ll be back with honey.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m coming with you. It’s dangerous, right? I’ll do it with you.”</p>
<p>Erin smiled at Lyonette. The girl smiled back. Both girls went over to the box of faerie flowers.</p>
<p>“They’re blooming nicely. Wow, I see new shoots already! Do you think it’s the mana in the inn?”</p>
<p>“It might be. Um—I’ll need to take a few, but the dead ones work best I think. We just need to start a fire in front of the bee cave you see—”</p>
<p>“Got it. What happens if the flowers don’t work? Do we run or hide?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And if the bees start waking up when we’re in the cave?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…Let’s take all these flowers, okay?”</p>
<p>Erin grabbed empty glass jars as Lyonette found the sharpest knife in the kitchen. Both girls were ready to go when they heard an anxious whine. They turned and saw Mrsha, huddling by the door.</p>
<p>Mrsha was shivering. Lyonette hurried over to her and stroked Mrsha’s head as she whispered comfortingly to the Gnoll.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to come. In fact, you’re staying far away. And no following me this time, okay?”</p>
<p>The Gnoll licked anxiously at Lyonette’s face and reached for her, but Lyonette made her sit. Erin watched the two hug before Lyonette got up. She was silent at first as they marched towards the cave in the snow. But then Erin felt compelled to speak.</p>
<p>“No one’s dying today. Right, Lyonette?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>The young girl’s face was set with determination. It was a long, hard march in the deep snow to the cave, but Lyonette knew the way and in short order she’d built the fire in front of the cave. There were ashes from the last one. Erin watched as she tossed the flowers in the fire and then both girls huddled in the snow outside of the cave.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for them to hear the bees come after the fire—and then fall asleep. Lyonette hurried into the cave with Erin right behind her. The girl froze as she saw a sea of fallen bees resting on the floor, but Lyonette stepped past them towards the massive bee hive in the back. Despite harvesting from it several times before, the hive looked as obscenely bloated as before.</p>
<p>“Oh my god. I’d never have the courage to do that myself.”</p>
<p>Erin watched with admiration and horror as Lyonette began to slice into the hive, many times over as large as she was. It filled the huge cave, and Erin wondered how many bees were inside. She prayed they were all sleeping.</p>
<p>Then Erin remembered <em>she</em> had a job to do as well! She hurriedly fished around in the rucksack she’d brought and pulled out a pair of tongs. She began picking up bees and dropping them in the jars, counting as she did.</p>
<p>“One bee, two bee, three bees…this one’s twitching. Ew. Four bees, five bees, ooh, big bee! Seven bees…”</p>
<p>They worked in sweaty, quick silence until Erin had two jars of bees and Lyonette two jars of honey, honeycomb, and other parts of the hive. Then they hurried out into the snow.</p>
<p>“We made it! Are we okay?”</p>
<p>“I think so.”</p>
<p>Lyonette was pale, but triumphant. She was a mess, covered all over by the hive. She jerked her head back towards the inn.</p>
<p>“We should get away as fast as we can. The bees get really, <em>really</em> angry when they wake up. We don’t want to be anywhere near them.”</p>
<p>“Got it. Let’s go!”</p>
<p>Erin had to heft both jars as she struggled through the snow. They’d brought a small sled to carry the jars on, but the jars kept falling off no matter how the girls tried to lash them onto the sled—and they didn’t feel like trying to tie a good knot so close to the cave.</p>
<p>They made tracks, huffing and puffing as they tried to force their unwilling legs to move faster. When they were a good distance from the cave, Erin relaxed slightly.</p>
<p>“I think we might be okay. Lyonette, do you do that every day?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but having someone else helps.”</p>
<p>Lyonette gasped as she panted for air. She looked at Erin with a smile of triumph and then turned pale.</p>
<p>“Erin. The jar…”</p>
<p>Erin looked down at the two massive jars she was holding and nearly screamed. The bees she’d put in the jar had woken up. And they were <em>alive.</em></p>
<p>Normally they suffocated or died of the cold. But these bees, freshly put to sleep, were still able to move. And they did. They wriggled and tried to flap their wings obscenely in the crowded confines of the jar. The pulsating mass made Erin want to drop the jar, but she hung on for dear life, checking the lid to make sure it was <em>secure</em>.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. They’ll die quick. Let’s just put it on the sled and—I need to have a bath after this.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Gingerly, Erin lashed the two jars securely to the sled. The bees wriggled angrily and tried to sting her hands through the glass, but they could do nothing. Erin continued onwards, pulling the sled as Lyonette followed her.</p>
<p>“So you did this three times before I got here? That’s amazing!”</p>
<p>Erin was trying to be as congratulatory as possible, and she meant it. Lyonette really had turned over a new leaf, and this one was massive. The girl beamed with pride as they passed by a huge mound of snow sitting in the middle of a flat part of the snowy plains.</p>
<p>“I had to. Honey’s the only thing everyone really likes. It was so scary—I nearly peed myself the first time! But your flowers really are incredible.”</p>
<p>“I know. I’m wondering what else they might be able to do! I’ll do some experiments—hopefully I can grow enough so that—”</p>
<p><em>Danger.</em> It wasn’t a word, just a thought, a bell rung at maximum volume in Erin’s head. She broke off and turned her head around immediately.</p>
<p>“Lyonette. Stop.”</p>
<p>The girl halted at once as Erin let go of the sledge and reached for the knife she always carried when she left the inn. Something was around them. She looked at Lyonette and the girl got the vibe at once. She drew closer to Erin as the [Innkeeper] eyed the ground.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“[Dangersense]. But I can’t tell from where. Is it Shield Spiders? Are we at their nest or—”</p>
<p>A spark lit up Erin’s mind. They had just passed something. She hadn’t noticed, but it stood out to her suddenly. Why was a <em>mound of snow in a flat plain—</em></p>
<p>She turned, just as the Rock Crab, camouflaged by the snow, stood up and sidled closer to her. It scuttled a few feet towards the girls, and then dropped down into the snow, looking like just another white part of the landscape. But Erin and Lyonette had seen.</p>
<p>It was less than fifteen feet away. Lyonette froze up and Erin felt her heart stop in her chest.</p>
<p>“Erin—what is—”</p>
<p>“Rock Crab. I told you—it’s too close.”</p>
<p>“W-what do we do? Run?”</p>
<p>“It’ll catch us.”</p>
<p>Erin knew that for a certainty. She clenched her teeth tightly, feeling the useless knife in her left hand.</p>
<p>“Seed cores would scare it away. But we don’t have any except at the inn!”</p>
<p>“In that case…”</p>
<p>“Just don’t move. I think it’s waiting for us to move. Let. Me. Think.”</p>
<p>Erin held very still as Lyonette shivered next to her. She knew the Rock Crab would strike sooner or later. When it did—</p>
<p>What could kill it? Adventurers. They were far away. Seed cores. Erin didn’t have any. Goblins? None around here since Rags was gone. Magic? No. Toren—</p>
<p>No. Erin closed her eyes. Fight while Lyonette ran for help? She’d be dead in a second. But if that was her option—</p>
<p>No. Wait. Something else struck Erin. She opened her eyes and stared at the sled she’d stopped pulling. At the things wriggling in the glass jars.</p>
<p>“Lyonette. Get ready to dive into the snow.”</p>
<p>“What? Wh—”</p>
<p>Lyonette’s eyes widened as Erin slowly, very slowly, waded over to the glass jars. Erin carefully lifted both jars of angry bees out of the sled, keeping her eyes on the mound of snow the entire time. Was it lifting up a bit?</p>
<p>She raised the first jar over her head and braced herself. Yes, the Rock Crab was moving. She saw it lift up, and then two long, flexible…</p>
<p>Were they eyes? Either that, or antennae. They stared at Erin and she stared at it. The Rock Crab hesitated, and then it lifted itself <em>up</em>, exposing a dark, red-brown body under its snowy shell and huge pincers that—</p>
<p>“<em>Duck!</em>”</p>
<p>Erin screamed and threw the first jar right into the Rock Crab’s shell. <em>Inside </em>of it, in fact. The glass broke and Erin heard a roar of buzzing as the bees were freed. She didn’t hesitate. She threw the second jar and then dove into the snow, digging herself deep as the bees buzzed in fury and the rock Crab <em>clicked.</em></p>
<p>That was the sound. A deep, echoing <em>click</em> of a sea creature. It was a counterpoint to the thunderous buzzing.</p>
<p><em>Clickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclick—</em></p>
<p>Erin didn’t know if Lyonette was alive. She could only hear the bees, the crab—and then silence. The buzzing faded, growing more muted, but never completely ceasing, but the crab…</p>
<p>After a while, Erin chanced raising her head out of the snow. She looked around and saw the crab’s shell, lowered to the ground. For a second she thought the crab was alive and her heart pounded wildly—but then she realized the truth.</p>
<p>“Lyonette.”</p>
<p>The girl screamed when Erin found her in the snow. But Lyonette realized it was just Erin and came up to see what had happened.</p>
<p>“It’s dead.”</p>
<p>Erin pointed shakily to the Rock Crab’s shell. She could see a few dead bees, smashed or in pieces around the shell, but only a few. The rest must have flown off. Lyonette stared at the shell and touched her ears.</p>
<p>“I can still hear buzzing though—”</p>
<p>“Yeah. The bees are <em>inside</em> the shell.”</p>
<p>Erin pointed to the shell where she could hear the dim thunder of wings as well. Lyonette grew pale as she realized what had happened.</p>
<p>The Ashfire Bees had stung the Rock Crab to death—from the inside. But they were trapped in its shell as well. Both groups were dead or soon to be dead if no one disturbed them.</p>
<p>Erin laughed, shakily. Lyonette looked at her as if she were crazy, but then uttered a strained laugh herself. Both girls laughed and laughed and then Lyonette sat down and cried while Erin went to find their sled.</p>
<p>It was smashed on one end, but one of the jars of honey was intact. That would do. Erin brought it back and she and Lyonette made their way back to the inn.</p>
<p>Neither one said much. Lyonette was sticky with honey and other fluids from the hive. Erin held the jar of honey as Lyonette struggled onwards, wiping at her mouth and spitting occasionally. She said not a word of complaint, but Erin saw her shiver more than once as the cold air froze her wet clothing.</p>
<p>When they got back, Erin let Mrsha leap on Lyonette as Lyonette hugged her and cried in relief. Erin pointed upstairs as Lyonette tried to stop Mrsha from rubbing her furry body all over her honeyed one.</p>
<p>“Bath!”</p>
<p>Both Gnoll and girl looked at her. Erin smiled.</p>
<p>“Go take a bath, Lyonette. Don’t worry about cleaning or anything else. Just have a nice time—and bring Mrsha with you too! She’s all sticky.”</p>
<p>“I can make it quick—”</p>
<p>“No, no!”</p>
<p>Erin mock-scowled at Lyonette.</p>
<p>“Bath time is a special time. It’s the <em>most </em>special time. You take a long hot soak, or I’ll fire you. I’m going back into the city—after I talk with Octavia. Go on! Shoo!”</p>
<p>She waved at Lyonette and then remembered what else she wanted to say.</p>
<p>“Lyonette?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Good work. I mean it.”</p>
<p>“But we lost the bees and most of the honey—”</p>
<p>“That wasn’t your fault.”</p>
<p>Erin looked sternly at Lyonette.</p>
<p>“You did amazing, getting us the honey. The Rock Crab…from now on, neither you and I are leaving the inn without seed cores, okay? And we’ll be twice as careful—I’m going with you each time. But we survived.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. We did.”</p>
<p>They left it at that. Erin went to the kitchen with the jar of honey before she remembered what she had to do with it. She put the honey on a table and sat down for a second.</p>
<p>Only then did Erin let herself shake uncontrollably. She trembled so badly she couldn’t&nbsp; stand or hold the glass of water she’d poured herself; it slopped everywhere.</p>
<p>Just for a few minutes. One. Five. Then Erin stopped. She stopped shaking, stood up, drank the rest of the water in the glass, and sighed.</p>
<p>“I’m alive. I’m alive. I’m alive and—I need to get back to work.”</p>
<p>Erin stumbled towards the door. She had to come back and grab the jar of honey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When she opened Krshia’s door this time, Brunkr was awake. Sort of. He was staring at his hand on the couch, not doing anything really. He didn’t look up as Erin came in.</p>
<p>“Go away, Human.”</p>
<p>“I have something that will help, Brunkr. I know how to help heal your hand.”</p>
<p>He looked up, full of hope and scorn. He frowned when he saw the huge glass jar of honey. Bits of honeycomb were stuck to the insides.</p>
<p>“What is that? Do you want to fatten me up before I lose my arm? Or is that for my aunt to sell?”</p>
<p>“It’s for you.”</p>
<p>Erin put the jar on the table, and turned to face Brunkr, hands on hips. She felt a bit better, although the smell of Brunkr’s infection didn’t help her stomach any.</p>
<p>“This honey is something Ryoka—do you know Ryoka? Well, it’s something that will help.”</p>
<p>“<em>How?</em>”</p>
<p>“What you’re going to do is—well, first, let me tend to your hand.”</p>
<p>Erin walked over to Brunkr. She’d brought a towel and a bag of salt. She put both down and he watched, confused and irritated as she found a basin. When Erin mixed some water she’d boiled in the kitchen with the salt he reacted poorly.</p>
<p>“You’re not splashing that on my hand.”</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>He yanked his hand away as she reached for it. Erin glared at him.</p>
<p>“You need to get your infection clean. For god’s sake, why haven’t you cleaned it yourself? It’s disgusting!”</p>
<p>“It always comes back.”</p>
<p>He growled with gritted teeth as he backed away from Erin. She put her hands on her hips and glared at him.</p>
<p>“I’m washing your arm. With that water.”</p>
<p>“No. I’m not having you pour that on my arm. I’ve suffered enough without your crazy Human remedies!”</p>
<p>“I’m not giving you a choice. Come on—”</p>
<p>Erin reached for Brunkr and he hit her. It was a fast punch that caught Erin on the side of the face. It wasn’t too strong—for Brunkr. Erin stumbled back and shook her head. Then she threw up.</p>
<p>Brunkr eyed Erin as she panted and stared at the mess on Krshia’s floor. He saw the Human girl look at the vomit puddle, and then at him. He snarled, full of hurt and anger. But Erin just turned away and went into the kitchen.</p>
<p>She came back with more water and a cloth. It took a bit of time for Erin to get the vomit out of the rug, but she had a skill. She tossed the dirty water out, cleaned her hands. Then she stopped in the living room and stared at Brunkr. He stared back.</p>
<p>Erin sighed. She took two steps over to Brunkr and he raised his hand threateningly. This time Erin drew back when he clenched his fist. She eyed him—</p>
<p>And then hit him in the stomach.</p>
<p>“<em>[Minotaur Punch]!</em>”</p>
<p>Brunkr doubled over as Erin belted him. He swung at her, but she ducked. Erin stomped on Brunkr’s toe and punched him in the chest. He didn’t fall from that, so she kneed him in the groin and then hit him in the face.</p>
<p>He hit her back. Erin stared up at the ceiling and then got up fast. She kicked the charging Brunkr in the groin again and shoved him on the couch as he doubled over, howling in pain.</p>
<p>“<em>Sit!</em>”</p>
<p>She shouted it so loudly the house rang. Brunkr tried to stand up—Erin raised a fist. He halted. His ears flattened, and the fight went out of him. He lay back on the couch and stared up at the ceiling. Erin breathed in and out heavily, and then reached for the basin of salt water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Does it hurt?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Sorry. I need to get the wound clean, though.”</p>
<p>Brunkr hissed through his teeth as Erin carefully dabbed at his red wound. She pressed at it and she saw his claws sink into Krshia’s already threadbare couch—but he didn’t say a word.</p>
<p>“You’re doing great. I know it hurts, and I’m sorry. I really am. But you need to keep it clean. All this pus and nasty stuff? It can’t stay in the wound.”</p>
<p>Brunkr growled, vexation clear in his voice.</p>
<p>“I know that. But it keeps—agh! Keeps coming back.”</p>
<p>“So keep getting rid of it! Who’s tougher, you or pus?”</p>
<p>Erin scowled as she took away the dirtied rag and dipped it in another bucket. She sighed, and stared at his arm.</p>
<p>The red, gaping injury did look awful, but it was better than the oozing mess of before. She had—against Brunkr’s wishes—also snipped off a lot of the hair around the injury to keep it from getting in. Now Erin fetched the jar of honey.</p>
<p>“Why honey? It won’t work.”</p>
<p>“Have you ever tried using honey on your injuries?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. Who would—argh!”</p>
<p>Brunkr yelped as Erin began spooning honey over his infected arm. She coated his open flesh liberally, making sure it was all covered by a layer of glistening liquid.</p>
<p>“There. That looks right.”</p>
<p>“And this is supposed to do what? Heal me?”</p>
<p>“It’s a salve. It’ll help keep germs away. Um—keep the infection from getting worse, and make it better.”</p>
<p>Erin pointed to the jar as she got the bandages she’d bought out and began wrapping them around Brunkr’s arm.</p>
<p>“Don’t eat the honey, obviously. It’s going to get really nasty over time I bet. Lots of hair, dirt…actually, wash your arm before you put the honey on it. But just <em>keep</em> putting it on, okay?”</p>
<p>He eyed her.</p>
<p>“When?”</p>
<p>“All the time! When you’re awake, when you’re asleep—all the time! If you can, keep honey on the injury every second. After you clean, again. Clean at least three times a day, and then reapply the honey salve. It’ll help get rid of the infection. Here, I’ll show you how to wrap a bandage over it…”</p>
<p>She finished tying the bandage over Brunkr’s arm. He stared at it and shook his head.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think I’ve done all this before? I’ve put the poultice the [Healer] gave me over my arm—it did nothing. I ate all the different meat my tribe mates gave me, I drank as many foul stews as my aunt made. Nothing worked. I burnt my wound with fire—”</p>
<p>“What? No wonder it’s so bad!”</p>
<p>Erin glared at Brunkr. He glared back. He tried to put anger in his tone, but there was more defeat than anything else.</p>
<p>“Your cure isn’t going to work. What makes a Human trick better than my people’s knowledge? All you’re using is <em>honey.</em>”</p>
<p>“It may just be honey, but I know this honey works. Ryoka knows it works. It’s not some quack medicine, okay? Cleaning your wound regularly, using honey and salt water—it’s all part of the healing. You have to do it all or it won’t work. Have faith.”</p>
<p>He glared at her. Brunkr grabbed Erin’s arm as she rolled up the rest of the bandage. It was a firm grip, but not meant to hurt.</p>
<p>“Faith? In what? This—this is just a fool’s cure. Why should I believe <em>honey</em> will cure…”</p>
<p>His voice broke.</p>
<p>“I will lose my hand. After this, it must be cut off. Not just my hand—my arm as well. I will lose it, and I will be a cripple. Not a warrior of my tribe—a half thing. Useless. Good only for the easiest chores.”</p>
<p>Erin stared at Brunkr. She didn’t know him. She’d only met him once or twice, and it always ended up in a fight, or so it seemed. But she could understand his fear, understand what he was going through.</p>
<p>“I know it’s scary. I know it’s hard to believe. But believe.”</p>
<p>“In what? In Humans?”</p>
<p>“No. In me.”</p>
<p>Erin grabbed Brunkr’s good arm with her own. She squeezed it hard, looking the Gnoll in the eye.</p>
<p>“Have faith in me. I want to help. And I know what I’m doing.”</p>
<p>He stared at her, and she saw the hope in his eyes that she was telling the truth. But then he looked away.</p>
<p>“Everyone says that.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>Erin sat with Brunkr as he let go of her and stared dully at his arm. She began tidying up in silence. After a minute, she spoke.</p>
<p>“You know, back home we don’t have magic.”</p>
<p>Brunkr looked up.</p>
<p>“You don’t?”</p>
<p>Erin shook her head as she sat the jar of honey in one corner of the room, balancing one of Krshia’s ladles on the lid.</p>
<p>“Nope. Not at all. Not a single [Mage]—heck, no one knows a single spell. Wild, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“How could your people survive? Even we have [Shamans]. How do you…do anything?”</p>
<p>“With technology. With things other than magic. You see, we study a lot of things. We’re not tough like Drakes or strong as Gnolls…we don’t have good noses or the ability to cast magic or anything else. But we think a lot. And we write everything down. And one of the things we write down is how to cure people.”</p>
<p>“Everyone does that. My people have cures—if I were back at home and it were summer, my aunt says she could have found the good dirt—”</p>
<p>“No, see that’s where you’re wrong. We’re not the same. Where I come from, we <em>don’t</em> have cures. It’s not a mystery whether people will get well or not. We know what causes what, and if we don’t know, we find out. We don’t say you <em>might</em> get better. We invent cures that work all the time, or nearly all the time. That’s why I know the honey will help, and the cleaning.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Erin nodded. She sat with Brunkr on the couch. He stared at her like Mrsha did to Lyonette when the girl talked with her. He wasn’t an adult, but a child, needing to believe all would be well. So Erin opened a door in her heart and remembered.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of people who were blind being cured. I’ve seen people who lost a hand—and then had it sewn right back on! Where I come from…we don’t use healing potions. We don’t rely on alchemy or magic. We use <em>medicine.</em> And this—this is medicine.”</p>
<p>She pointed to the honey.</p>
<p>“It will work. It has antibodies—and it’s useful for fighting infections. When you need healing, you keep the wound clean and don’t let anything get on it. That’s the basics. I’m going to talk with an [Alchemist] after this and see about getting better medicine made, but this will do in the meantime.”</p>
<p>“And you’re sure it will work? How can you be?”</p>
<p>Erin met Brunkr’s eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m sure I’m doing the right thing. I’m not sure it will work. But I am sure that this is the only chance you have.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t what he wanted to hear. Brunkr looked away. Erin grabbed his paw. She waited until he looked back at her again.</p>
<p>“Believe me, please. If this doesn’t work, I’ll come back with a saw. Because you’re going to lose your hand otherwise. If you won’t do exactly what I ask…you’d better hurry up and chop your arm off before the rest of you gets infected. But until that day comes, I’ll tell you to do this. Because I know what I’m doing is right.”</p>
<p>The Gnoll stared at Erin for a long time. She could feel his pulse beating through his fur and skin.</p>
<p>“I wish I could believe you. I almost do.”</p>
<p>“Try?”</p>
<p>Brunkr hesitated. He looked away and sighed.</p>
<p>“I will try. I have nothing left to lose.”</p>
<p>“No. You have your hand to lose. But it’s not going to happen. It’s going to be okay. It’s <em>going</em> to be okay. Understand?”</p>
<p>She hugged him. The Gnoll froze, but Erin wrapped her arms around him and squeezed hard. Brunkr made a small sound, but she just kept repeating the words.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be okay. You’re going to be alright. It’s going to be okay. Your hand is going to get better. I’m going to come back and you’re going to keep changing your bandages, and it’s going to get better. I promise. It’s going to be okay. Okay?”</p>
<p>He said not a word, but put a paw on her shoulder. Erin felt him squeeze, and hugged tighter. She couldn’t see his face, but she felt him, as tightly as they were holding each other.</p>
<p>He was trembling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Erin left the apartment an hour later, she saw Krshia waiting for her outside. Snow had piled up in the Gnoll’s fur, but she hadn’t come inside. She nodded at Erin.</p>
<p>“I heard what you told my nephew. You give him hope. But it is not certain, no?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t lie.”</p>
<p>Krshia nodded.</p>
<p>“I know. And I will trust. And hope.”</p>
<p>“There’s more that can be done. I’m going to try and find something else that’ll help more than the honey. I’ll let you know. Just—help him, okay?”</p>
<p>“I will. He has hope, thanks to you.”</p>
<p>Krshia hesitated. She bent closer to Erin and whispered, so softly that only the girl could hear it, not Brunkr, sleeping inside.</p>
<p>“I tell you, I did not believe when I gave him all those remedies before. I did not believe, because I thought his hand was lost. But you believe. I can smell it, and so can he. Thank you for that.”</p>
<p>“That’s just who I am. A silly believer.”</p>
<p>Erin smiled. She squeezed Krshia’s arm and the Gnoll hugged her briefly. Erin stepped away and walked out of the city.</p>
<p>She was tired. So tired. Erin yawned, and stared at the sun.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>It was just past midday. Erin blinked and rubbed her eyes. She felt so tired. So—incredibly tired. How was it only that early? But then she heard a shout.</p>
<p>“Erin!”</p>
<p>Someone—a group of someones were waving at her. Erin automatically waved back and saw Pawn, Belgrade, Bird…walking together with Klbkch and the wonderfully strange blue Antinium. Further away, she saw Zel and the adventurers making their way to her inn.</p>
<p>Something like a sigh escaped Erin, although she kept a smile on her face. More people, all of whom wanted to see her, or at least wanted to eat something hot cooked by her. She felt so tired, so endlessly tired.</p>
<p>But the day wasn’t over. And Erin had a job to do. She began to walk more quickly back towards her inn, and then stopped. She stared at the sky.</p>
<p>The sun was shining bright. It was shining in a sky full of clouds. Erin could see more on the horizon. Soon they would turn the world dark and grey, and pour snow down again. It would grow colder. The world would be washed away by ice once more.</p>
<p>But for a moment the sun shone. Then a cloud passed before it. Erin felt her spirits drop as the light faded. But it would come back. She had to believe that. She wanted to sleep a thousand years, but she looked at her friends and took a smile out of her heart and wore it bright on her face. Because if she didn’t smile, who would?</p>
<p>The sun would come out again. Erin knew it. She whispered as she walked back to her inn, feeling exhaustion in every line of her body. It was a simple thing. It was all you had to do, even when everything else was uncertain.</p>
<p>“Have faith.”</p>

		<p>She didn’t want to walk up the hill to her inn. No—it wasn’t that. Erin didn’t want to walk up the hill to her inn and go inside. Or…no, it was more like she didn’t want to walk up the hill to her inn, go inside, and then have to feed and deal with another crowd of people right this instant.</p>
<p>Maybe in five minutes Erin would feel good about that, but right now she could only sigh as she stomped through the cold snow, up the steep and unreasonably treacherous hill, towards her inn.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that she was tired. Well, she <em>was</em> tired, but it wasn’t a physical thing. Erin was used to being on her feet all day long and working hard. She could fight off Goblins and cook pasta while picking blue fruit in the snow. But she’d been working hard of late. Very hard. And Erin felt just a bit…</p>
<p>Here was the problem. Erin wasn’t just tired. That was a simple thing to fix. Tired was immediate, and solvable with sleep. It was a drain on the mind, a heavy little rock tied to the eyelids that made them close far too often.</p>
<p>Tired was simple. But Erin was exhausted. She just felt like—like—</p>
<p>“Like I need a holiday.”</p>
<p>Erin sighed as she trudged up the hill towards her inn. Everyone else had already disappeared inside; part of her was already thinking about what she could make for lunch. She hadn’t had time for that because she’d had to go to Brunkr. Erin didn’t regret that, but she knew the others would be hungry.</p>
<p>She was ready to apologize and get to work, but found to her great joy that Lyonette had already made something to eat!</p>
<p>“It’s well, it’s a fry-up with mushrooms and other greens. You can have it with fresh bread and I’ve got fried beef if anyone wants meat. It’s got a Gnoll sauce on it, so it’s a bit spicy…”</p>
<p>Erin sidled over as she saw the travel-hungry people lining up to fill their plates. Lyonette had put out a big dish of the fried veggies and meat for people to serve themselves buffet-style.</p>
<p>“You did all this?”</p>
<p>Lyonette nodded, smiling as she passed out plates. Erin resisted the urge to kiss Lyonette and instead hugged with one arm.</p>
<p>“You’re so cool. Best [Barmaid] ever!”</p>
<p>There was a plate, a fork provided by Mrsha, although it was covered with a few hairs, and hot food. For a few seconds Erin just chewed on crispy, crunchy green tubes and relaxed. The warmth went down into her stomach and made her feel alive again.</p>
<p>Then she looked around and took stock of her inn. It was a full room today. Not only had some of the [Wagon Drivers] stopped here to eat, but Pawn, Belgrade, and Bird and a small group of Soldiers and Workers were in line as well. Klbkch was conspicuous in his absence, as was the strange group of Antinium who’d followed him.</p>
<p>Erin went over to Pawn, thanking Lyonette in her heart—the girl must have figured out the Antinium might show up, hence the non-gluten meal she’d made. She smiled at Pawn and took time to welcome both Belgrade and Bird—she hadn’t seen them in what felt like forever!</p>
<p>The two other workers were almost shy as they bowed to Erin. Pawn was more relaxed, and showed the other Workers how to hold the plates properly—they had to do it for their Soldier counterparts, since the giant warrior Antinium couldn’t properly grasp the plates.</p>
<p>“I apologize, but I fear they will have to use their hands to eat, Erin. We will clean up any mess we cause.”</p>
<p>“Totally fine. Totally—don’t worry about messes. I’ve got a Skill! But if your uh, Soldiers have problems eating we can give them bowls.”</p>
<p>“That would help greatly. Thank you.”</p>
<p>A trip into the kitchen and the Soldiers had bowls to hold instead of plates. Erin smiled as she stood with the Antinium in line, watching the queue pass the buffet line. Everyone was hungry, but they’d stood aside to let the adventurers go first. And Zel. All the Drakes practically ushered him to the front, despite his reluctance.</p>
<p>“Klbkch sends his regards. He wished to meet you at the inn, but he has pressing business in the Hive. I believe he will attempt to visit you tonight, if his duties allow.”</p>
<p>“Of course he will.”</p>
<p>Erin sighed, but smiled at Belgrade. She watched as ahead of her, the Horns of Hammerad reached the table and began filling their plates.</p>
<p>“Silver and steel you two, eat <em>something</em> that isn’t meat or bread!”</p>
<p>Yvlon snapped exasperatedly at Ceria and Pisces. Both had gone for the sliced beef, completely skipping the vegetables. Ksmvr and Yvlon had a more balanced plate, but the two mages looked completely unapologetic.</p>
<p>“I’m a half-Elf. I used to eat leaves for breakfast. I’ve had enough of them for one lifetime, thank you.”</p>
<p>Pisces nodded.</p>
<p>“And I—”</p>
<p>He hesitated, eyed the slices of beef and added two more to his full plate. Then he turned and walked away. Yvlon rolled her eyes and made a disgusted face, but she followed her friends to the table.</p>
<p>“My body is dead, so uh, I can eat unhealthy.”</p>
<p>Jelaqua grinned as she emulated Ceria’s style. Erin saw Lyonette hurry into the kitchen—probably to cook what meat they had left. Erin resolved to order a lot more from Krshia when she went to the city again. Her feet were already aching.</p>
<p>“If you’re dead, why would it matter what you eat? Surely you can’t taste anything.”</p>
<p>That came from Typhenous. Jelaqua turned, pretending to be offended.</p>
<p>“I’ll have you know that I keep my body’s tongue in perfect condition see? Now, some other organs are a bit the worse for wear, but taste is something everyone likes.”</p>
<p>“<strong>True. Now move, you’re holding up the line.</strong>”</p>
<p>Seborn edged past Jelaqua. He and Moore had balanced plates, Moore with more vegetable and bread than meat.</p>
<p>Griffon Hunt came next. Ulrien, Halrac and Typhenous got their food without objection, but when Revi reached the head of the table she took one look at the spread and made a face.</p>
<p>“I don’t like mushrooms.”</p>
<p>Halrac growled at her.</p>
<p>“Then get the beef.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to eat just meat for lunch.”</p>
<p>Erin hurried out of line, already slapping her I’m-sorry-you-suck smile onto her face.</p>
<p>“What’s the problem, Revi?”</p>
<p>“Nothing here really appeals to me.”</p>
<p>The Stitch-girl turned her nose up at the food. Erin kept smiling.</p>
<p>“Okay, why don’t I make you a sandwich? Toasted bread, cheese, some sliced ham and greens?”</p>
<p>“I suppose that will do.”</p>
<p>Revi sighed and nodded. Erin hurried into the kitchen, but not before she’d passed Zel and heard him mutter.</p>
<p>“<em>Mages.</em>”</p>
<p>It was the work of a minute to put together a lovely sandwich. No problem at all, really. But Erin had had to do it, which was what sucked. Lyonette was apologetic.</p>
<p>“I should have made something for Revi.”</p>
<p>“No, you shouldn’t. She’s just picky.”</p>
<p>Erin made a face as she used a pair of tongs to toast the sandwich to perfection by the kitchen fire. She pulled the sandwich away as her Skill told her it was done—it was like an egg timer going off in Erin’s head—and tossed it onto a plate.</p>
<p>“You know, I’ve heard that when [Chefs] and [Waiters] don’t like the people they’re serving, they spit in the food.”</p>
<p>“Ew! Do you think—do they really do that?”</p>
<p>Erin didn’t see why Lyonette was so upset, but the girl was staring off into the horrific abyss of recollection.</p>
<p>“They didn’t do that to my food—I’m sure of—but if I—”</p>
<p>She turned green. Erin waved a hand in front of her face and Lyonette came out of her trance.</p>
<p>“Well? I’m not saying you should, but…”</p>
<p>Both girls stared at the innocent sandwich. They shook their heads at roughly the same time.</p>
<p>“It’s not worth it. Besides, that’s disgusting.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s not the sandwich’s fault.”</p>
<p>Lyonette nodded. She frowned, and then went over to the cutting board where some of the ingredients were left over. She took an unused mushroom and diced it up into very fine pieces, hiding them in the melted cheese. Erin smiled as Lyonette closed the sandwich.</p>
<p>“Hey Revi, you aren’t allergic to mushrooms or anything, right? If it touches your skin, you won’t break out in hives or swell up, because if you are—”</p>
<p>“I’m fine. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Revi took the plate from Erin without a glance and began eating it with a knife and fork. Erin winked as Lyonette came out of the kitchen with more food for the buffet table. That was a small victory in her books.</p>
<p>“Oh, you don’t need to eat the food here! I’m sorry, I forgot!”</p>
<p>She stopped Pawn as he was about to fill his plate. Lyonette hurried into the kitchen and came out with—</p>
<p>“<em>Bees?</em>”</p>
<p>The Drakes and Humans behind the Antinium took a step back. But all the Antinium perked up.</p>
<p>“I fried these in oil and then melted some cheese over them. Ksmvr says it’s good.”</p>
<p>Lyonette explained as she sat the Antinium at another table. With Erin’s help all of them had a few bees to eat, and Ksmvr came over as well to get his bugs. Erin sat next to Pawn and Bird, trying not to watch them eat as she slurped down her food.</p>
<p>Pawn was already pulling the legs off of his bee and crunching them down, but Belgrade and Bird stared at their food as if entranced.</p>
<p>“Well? Are you hungry? Or do you not like bees?”</p>
<p>“It is not that, Miss Erin. I have been waiting a long time for this moment. I wish to savor it.”</p>
<p>Belgrade stared at the bee dripping oil onto his plate. Bird stared at his bee and then picked it up. He spoke dreamily.</p>
<p>“They look like tiny birds. Bee birds.”</p>
<p>Erin glanced over, and saw Pawn and Belgrade shrug. She shrugged too, and began to eat. This was lunch. And since she hadn’t made it, Erin was a very happy [Innkeeper] indeed.</p>
<p>Work interrupted her before she’d finished eating, though. The door opened and a familiar blue-scaled Drake walked in.</p>
<p>“Erin?”</p>
<p>His face fell when he saw all of her visitors.</p>
<p>“If you’re busy, I can go. I’d hate to interrupt—”</p>
<p>“Olesm! No, I’m just finishing my lunch and Lyonette can serve everyone food and drinks. Uh, you can do that, right Lyonette? If you need a hand—”</p>
<p>“I’ve got two!”</p>
<p>Lyonette waved at Erin and smiled as she went past. Mrsha, trotting beside Lyonette, sat on her bum and waggled all four paws. Erin grinned and turned to Olesm.</p>
<p>“Want to sit? How about next to Pawn? You can eat mushroom stir-fry and tell me what’s happened, and then I’ll teach you all how to play Go!”</p>
<p>Olesm perked up and sat happily with Erin. He took one look at what the Antinium were eating and declined to have lunch.</p>
<p>“So, tell me everything that’s happened to you!”</p>
<p>“Only if you’ll tell me what happened! I heard a bit from Klbkch, but where did you <em>go</em>, Erin? That skeleton, Toren, did something, didn’t he?”</p>
<p>“You don’t know?”</p>
<p>A sea of Antinium and one Drake all shook their heads. Erin blinked.</p>
<p>“Okay. Then in that case, it all started when I was going to get more honey. I was in the sled with Toren pulling it and I took a tiny, <em>teensy</em> nap…”</p>
<p>Catching up with Olesm took half an hour of talk. Erin was aware of time passing and cut her story short, but she just <em>had</em> to pause when she’d heard what Olesm had done.</p>
<p>“A chess newsletter? That’s so amazing, Olesm! Can I subscribe? Oh—and what’s the latest puzzle? You do chess puzzles, right?”</p>
<p>Olesm’s light blue scales turned bright as he blushed. He traced on the table with a claw as Erin exclaimed over the letters he’d sent to other cities.</p>
<p>It was a simple collection of parchments, not anything like a magazine or newspaper. One was an annotated game—one of the ones she’d played, if Erin wasn’t mistaken!—and another was an explanation of how to read chess notation. Another paper held a chess puzzle someone had made.</p>
<p>“Ooh. Not bad.”</p>
<p>Erin solved the puzzle in three moves and handed it back to Olesm. His jaw dropped.</p>
<p>“You can’t have just—”</p>
<p>“I solved one like that ages ago. It’s good, though!”</p>
<p>“I got that one from the best [Strategists] in…oh, never mind.”</p>
<p>Olesm handed Erin another piece of parchment.</p>
<p>“Please, look at this.”</p>
<p>It was another annotated game, but not one Erin had played. To her eye, it was a fairly interesting back-and-forth between two decently skilled players. But what was really interesting was the attached commentary. Three full pages filled with comments from both players and two other [Tacticians] provided a decent analysis of every move made.</p>
<p>“Olesm, this is so <em>cool.</em> I’m so glad you’re doing this!”</p>
<p>“Well, I got the idea from watching you play. I sent some letters out and got a great response, so I’ve been sending more out each week! I’ve got over twenty readers so far, and I’m told my letters get passed around to lots more people! And it’s very profitable!”</p>
<p>Olesm puffed out his chest. Erin smiled. Internally, she was remorseful. She <em>never</em> had time to play chess anymore, or so it seemed! All that time in Celum and she hadn’t picked up a pawn once. Chess was her <em>thing!</em></p>
<p>“Can you give me all your old letters? I’d love to solve a chess puzzle or two.”</p>
<p>“Erin, your puzzles are the ones I’ve been using!”</p>
<p>“Aw. No. Really? You’ve got to get more! And twenty people is great, but why not send this to [Tacticians] all over the world?”</p>
<p>“Don’t stop there. Is the inventor of chess not Niers Astoragon? He and the [Strategists] in Baleros might find your work very useful.”</p>
<p>Pawn put down the parchment he was holding and looked at Olesm. The Drake fidgeted in his chair. His tail lashed the legs of the table in his agitation.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t dream of sending my small work to him, but perhaps if someone were to mention it to Master Astoragon—well, I’d need for a lot more people to read my work before I’d be confident sending it to Baleros.”</p>
<p>“Why? Because it’s expensive?”</p>
<p>“Well…[Tacticians] are held in such high regard there, I would hate to embarrass myself. Not that I think your games are anything but perfect, Erin! But it’s just…”</p>
<p>“You should do it.”</p>
<p>Belgrade stared at Olesm. Bird looked up from his bee.</p>
<p>“Yes. I agree with what Belgrade is saying. You should do this thing I know nothing of.”</p>
<p>Pressured on all sides, Olesm could only stammer about ‘improving the quality of his publication’. Erin laughed, and decided not to push him further. He, at least, seemed like he was doing well on his own.</p>
<p>“Maybe you can add this to your next newsletter. I’ll teach you all how to play Go while you’re here!”</p>
<p>“<em>Really?</em>”</p>
<p>Olesm, Pawn, and Belgrade all sat up. Erin nodded.</p>
<p>“All we need are some stones and a board. I figure we can make one—uh—”</p>
<p>The Antinium stood up, Workers and Soldiers. They immediately filed out of the door. Erin blinked, and then saw them digging in the snow outside through one of the windows.</p>
<p>“Um—okay! Let’s do this!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“So, we have white and black stones. Two sides, like chess, see? And you’re capturing territory. You place the stones on the intersections, where the lines join like right here. Each stone can have up to four liberties—that means open spaces where a stone <em>could </em>go—in each direction like this. If you take away all the liberties, you capture the stone. Now, the goal is to get as much territory—as much of the board as possible—and as many captured stones as possible.”</p>
<p>Erin demonstrated, surrounding a black stone with white ones. She took it off the board and put it to one side.</p>
<p>“We call captured stones prisoners. And ooh, here’s something cool. You see these connected stones? Well, if they’re all touching each other we call that a string. And you can capture an entire string at once, but <em>only</em> if you take over all of their liberties. So that’s definitely something to watch for…”</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, Erin stood over a table where a bunch of white and black stones were sitting. They were freshly painted, and a bit tacky to the touch still, although a flame spell had baked the paint nicely.</p>
<p>The board for the game was carved into the table. It was just a huge block of equally-sized squares, nineteen lines long by nineteen lines wide. Erin didn’t mind sacrificing the table; you could still eat on it and she had a feeling a lot of games would be played in the future.</p>
<p>She was lecturing a crowd of people, not just Olesm and the Antinium. The Drakes and Gnolls were interested in this new game, and a few of the adventurers had come over to listen. Typhenous and Pisces looked particularly interested; Moore was jotting what Erin was saying down on a slip of parchment, and Ulrien and Halrac were listening while drinking.</p>
<p>The game of Go was simple, yet complex. It was all about capturing territory, which, when you got down to it, was at the heart of chess as well.</p>
<p>“Although chess is about completely eradicating the opponent’s pieces, I see many similarities in this game.”</p>
<p>“Yup. Most strategy games revolve around stealing an opponent’s territory. It’s pretty hard to lose all your pieces in a game of Go, but it <em>can</em> happen. If you suck. A lot.”</p>
<p>Erin smiled at Pawn as she demonstrated how the game was played to her audience.</p>
<p>“The thing about Go is that—and I hate to say this, but it’s true—it’s far more complex than chess.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes. It’s very complex, but easy to understand. All you do is surround your opponent, but the game can take infinite forms. See, you can place a stone anywhere unless it means you’d lose it. So unlike chess…”</p>
<p>“There’s so much you can do.”</p>
<p>Olesm stared down at the empty board, seemingly daunted by its size. Erin smiled.</p>
<p>“I’m not as good at Go as I am at Chess, but I’m not bad. I used to study it and play games back home.”</p>
<p>“You did? I’ve never heard of it.”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>Erin shrugged. She remembered staying up late at night, playing games online. She smiled sadly as she picked up a rough stone one of the Soldiers had smashed to make smaller and put it on the board.</p>
<p>“I used to play all the time. I was close to the professional level—not that I played half as much as I did chess. But I loved playing. Chess, Shogi, Go…it’s too bad I couldn’t gamble, because I can play a mean round of Mahjong as well. Anyways. Does anyone want to play a game?”</p>
<p>There were no shortages of volunteers. Erin soon found herself having Halrac carve a second and third board into the tables for people to play as the Soldiers went out to search for more stones.</p>
<p>“We really need round stones to play properly. But this is fine, I guess.”</p>
<p>“May I request your assistance in teaching me this game, Erin? I hope to learn as much as I can before Anand returns.”</p>
<p>Belgrade intercepted Erin before Pawn or Olesm could. Erin smiled at the Worker.</p>
<p>“Sure. Is that a bit of rivalry I hear?”</p>
<p>She was just teasing him, but the Antinium nodded to her great surprise. Erin blinked.</p>
<p>“I wish to beat Anand at this game. He is a better player than I, so I must practice more than he does.”</p>
<p>“Really? But I thought you two were closely matched. You were when I played you last time. Has something changed?”</p>
<p>Belgrade paused.</p>
<p>“Perhaps it is the difference of personality. Anand is far more decisive and bold than I. That is why he was chosen to remain behind at Esthelm. His ability to react to new situations is deemed invaluable. I can only memorize patterns and repeat them.”</p>
<p>He looked downcast. Erin reached out and patted him on the shoulder. Then she gave up and gave him a quick hug. As she did, she saw Zel standing by a far wall. He was watching the Antinium. Not with overt hostility like he did with Klbkch, but very intently. He was staring at Belgrade and Erin was sure he’d heard what the Antinium had said. Zel looked away the instant Erin saw him.</p>
<p>“Well, if Anand is so good at improvising, all you’ve got to do is study every chess move until you’re used to every possible outcome. Following your style isn’t bad, Belgrade. You’ve just got to be able to adapt.”</p>
<p>She led Belgrade over to a board and began to explain strategy. He shook his head dejectedly as Erin tried to get him to experiment while playing her.</p>
<p>“I fear making mistakes in experimentation. I prefer known strategy. I fear I will be poor at this game.”</p>
<p>“No you won’t!”</p>
<p>“But known tactics fail in the face of innovation. Anand is spontaneous, I am not. How can I ever defeat him?”</p>
<p>Erin had a reply ready, but to her intense surprise Zel came over and answered the question for her.</p>
<p>“Just because someone can adapt, doesn’t mean their strategy is better than a set formation. It’s a longstanding argument between [Planners] and [Leaders]. One kind—[Strategists] for instance—likes to plan for every eventuality. They see patterns in troop movements and in battle and react accordingly. But [Generals] like me just see opportunities. We act according to instinct.”</p>
<p>He nodded to Pawn as he walked over and stood over the board. He didn’t look happy, but there was something in the way Pawn turned to look at Zel that made Erin think they had talked before. Zel studied the board, frowning at the intersecting lines on which stones had been placed.</p>
<p>“There’s some overlap of course; most leaders learn basic formations and strategy, but there are few who can lead from the front and fight a war in their heads. But specialization isn’t all bad—you get weird freaks with classes like [Shadow General] or [Lightningstrike Commander] who can use one type of tactic very well.”</p>
<p>“Then I may succeed by using my set methods?”</p>
<p>“If you can adapt them for every situation, yes. Who’s to say one method can’t be used in most situations? So long as you have others who can support you—or you know when to retreat—I don’t see why not.”</p>
<p>That was what Belgrade needed to hear. He sat straighter and began to play a far more competitive game. Erin still beat him, but she felt good doing it.</p>
<p>“May I try?”</p>
<p>Zel took Erin’s place, and Pawn took Belgrade’s. This time the game was short. Zel bowed out as it became clear Pawn was the far better player. He shook his head as he let Pisces slip into the seat.</p>
<p>“It’s just black and white stones to me. I’m used to battles where no one takes turns and everyone’s slipping on blood and guts. But if it makes you level, I’m sure every [Tactician] south of Liscor will be begging for a copy of young Olesm’s next newsletter.”</p>
<p>Olesm beamed with pride. He looked at Zel like a hero, Erin recognized. And the [General] was, wasn’t he? Erin had a hard time imagining it, but Zel was a big hero. One of the biggest, according to what Pisces had told her.</p>
<p>“You should send this with your next newsletter, Olesm. And what about sending it north?”</p>
<p>“North? Well…I sent a few letters to Invrisil and some [Tacticians] I’d heard of, but I’ve really been reaching out to friends I regularly correspond with. They’ve been spreading the word in the Drake cities. You really think I should expand so soon…?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Send it to us Humans…and Gnolls too, for that matter! Why not? You should send some letters to a bunch of Gnolls—I’m sure Krshia could tell you who might be interested. Yeah, send like a dozen letters out for free. If they like it, they’ll reply back. If not…”</p>
<p>Erin shrugged. She sat Olesm down at a table as lunchtime turned into board-game time. Lyonette was already hurrying out with drinks and a snack, and Erin saw those not interested in the game heading out for the city. It was only a little bit past midday. She had time. So Erin sat across from Olesm.</p>
<p>“Now, you’ve got a lot of good stuff, but have you considered having your parchment all stitched together?”</p>
<p>“Like a book? That’s costly.”</p>
<p>“No, not a book. It can be cheap. But you see, if you have a bit of color and maybe a little gossip, well, back home we call stuff like that <em>magazines.</em> I’m sure Krshia could find you someone who does a bit of artwork. You should have a little logo—ooh, and maybe a [Tactician] of the week! It’s good to reach out to your readers and get them involved. And while I’m on the subject, why not print a lot of issues of your newsletter and have them for sale in the Runner’s Guilds? If you do, then anyone can walk in and buy it. And if they don’t sell that well, it’s fine because you’re getting the word out. Now, my favorite part of newspapers back home is this thing called a ‘crossword’. It’s not chess, but…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things from home. Things she remembered. When you got down to it, that was what Erin truly had to offer to this world. She was just an average girl, but she’d brought part of the place she came from with her. That was what she could give, and that was what made Erin special, she felt.</p>
<p>Her memories of home.</p>
<p>Some of it was stupid. Some of it wouldn’t help. The people of this world took what they wanted, what was useful, and only that. No one had liked the idea of crossword puzzles, not even Pisces. The consensus was that if you were going to be silly about words, you probably had better things you could be doing with your time.</p>
<p>But not all of what Erin had said was pointless. She saw the value in it already, as Olesm strode out of the door, bursting with ideas for his newsletter. And she saw it in Pawn and the Antinium as they left for the Hive, already planning to introduce the game to the Workers there. A new board game had come to the city. It was a small thing, but it mattered.</p>
<p>Everything mattered. Small things became big things, like how a clean inn was wonderful. So Erin helped Lyonette clean up for half an hour after her guests had finished, and then told Lyonette she was heading out. Again.</p>
<p>Only this time, Erin didn’t take the door leading to the outside world. She took the door to Octavia’s shop.</p>
<p>“Hey Octavia! I’m—”</p>
<p>Erin stopped and stared. Octavia was standing at her counter and she had a customer.</p>
<p>The man at the counter gave Erin an odd look, mainly because she was staring at him like he was some new, undocumented species never seen before. He accepted a potion that bubbled brightly pink in a stoppered vial and hurried away.</p>
<p>“Who was that? Why was he here?”</p>
<p>“That was a customer, and he was buying a potion. What the potion was isn’t your business.”</p>
<p>Octavia scowled at Erin as the girl approached the counter. The [Alchemist] seemed irked today for some reason.</p>
<p>“Aw. You can’t tell me? Why not?”</p>
<p>“Confidentiality. [Alchemists] don’t reveal what they’ve sold on principle. You could be an adventurer or a [Barber], but some of what I sell—”</p>
<p>“Was it a love potion? Or…is it like a healing potion for something icky?”</p>
<p>Octavia ignored the questions. She glared at Erin.</p>
<p>“Do you need something? Or are you just using my shop as a rest stop?”</p>
<p>“I’ve got business! For you!”</p>
<p>Erin smiled at Octavia, but for once even the word ‘business’ didn’t make the Stitch-girl jolly. Octavia folded her arms. Erin’s smile slipped.</p>
<p>“What? Did I do something?”</p>
<p>“Oh, nothing. I’m just waiting for you to figure it out.”</p>
<p>It took Erin a few seconds. She knew Octavia’s shop had been the delivery point for all of Celum’s goods and the people sent through, but it was for a good cause! So why—</p>
<p>Erin’s head turned and she saw the problem. The front wall of Octavia’s shop that led out into the street…was gone. Someone had knocked the entire wall down, and it was now patched up by a collection of plywood planks. It wasn’t a good seal. Wind was blowing into the shop through the cracks.</p>
<p>“Oh. Uh, is that—”</p>
<p>“They knocked it in. To fit a<em> wagon</em> into my shop.”</p>
<p>Octavia’s tone could have frozen boiling water. She pointed at the front of her store.</p>
<p>“I was reimbursed for that, but hardly enough. You may note how I haven’t had it fixed yet? That’s because the cost of wood is very high in the winter. And guess who gets to pay for that? Not the city. <em>Me.</em>”</p>
<p>“Sorry.”</p>
<p>Erin took a deep breath. She felt guilty, and changed what she’d planned on doing. She put her hands on Octavia’s counter.</p>
<p>“I’ll pay you back for that. But can we talk business?”</p>
<p>The [Alchemist] wavered. An epic battle between mercantilism and personal irritation lasted for all of fifteen seconds, before she grudgingly nodded.</p>
<p>“What do you want?”</p>
<p>“I need all my magical soups. You know, the ones you were holding for me for a ‘storage fee’?”</p>
<p>Octavia hesitated.</p>
<p>“I have them. I <em>may</em> have sold one or two—but I have your cut right here and I would be happy to reimburse you for the cost of—”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Erin didn’t blink. Octavia looked at her, surprised, and decided not to question it. She went into the back of her shop and came out with a bunch of bottles full of soupy liquids.</p>
<p>“That will be—”</p>
<p>“Hold on, you can combine that with my next order.”</p>
<p>“Next order?”</p>
<p>“I want you to do some research! I think you can make this one thing I want right away—it’s called a ‘match’, and I need you to make it for me. Ryoka says it’s simple, but this other thing is really hard. It’s called ‘penicillin’, right, and—”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>Octavia glared at Erin.</p>
<p>“I said no. I’m not doing any more research for you. You’re trouble. Every time I do something for you, I end up with a melted cauldron, or a hole in my shop, or a hole in my <em>wall.</em> I’m not helping you.”</p>
<p>“What? But—I can pay.”</p>
<p>“Too bad. It’s not worth the cost.”</p>
<p>“I think it is. Here—”</p>
<p>Erin reached for her money pouch, but Octavia snapped at her.</p>
<p>“Erin, no. I have several orders I need to fill, not to mention a <em>gaping hole in the front of my shop!</em> I won’t just let you—”</p>
<p>She broke off as Erin produced a fistful of coins. She slapped them on the table. They were heavy, thick coins. All gold.</p>
<p>Octavia swallowed. Hard. But she held her ground, though the luster of the softly glowing gold had fixed her eyes on them.</p>
<p>“A few gold coins won’t—”</p>
<p>Erin reached into her pouch and pulled more out. Octavia’s mouth stopped working for a few seconds.</p>
<p>“Look, I have a job to do and—”</p>
<p>Erin kept placing gold coins on the counter. She had to pile them up; she was counting. It wasn’t like she was made of money, but she had to make this right for Octavia.</p>
<p>In the end, thirty six gold coins sat in neat stacks of six in front of Octavia. The [Alchemist] gaped at them, and then looked up at Erin.</p>
<p>“That’s for your door, <em>and</em> hiring you. You can sell what I’m going to have you make, but I want to hire you. Is that okay?”</p>
<p>Octavia stared at the coins, and then looked at Erin. She glanced over Erin’s shoulder at the hole in her wall, and went back to the coins. Coins, Erin, broken wall. And then she threw her arms wide.</p>
<p>“Always a pleasure, <em>always</em> a pleasure to help my best customer! Hole in the wall? What hole? I was thinking I needed a new front for the shop anyways!”</p>
<p>Erin smiled. She looked Octavia in the eye.</p>
<p>“I’m really sorry, Octavia. I haven’t been a good friend to you.”</p>
<p>Octavia paused, and grew a bit more genuine as she raked the gold coins into a drawer.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not like it wasn’t for a good cause. And the publicity! I suppose I can let it go. Especially if you’re paying me like this. Actually, for this rate, knock another wall down whenever you want! Now, what’s this about some experimentation?”</p>
<p>Erin smiled. She opened her mouth and then stared hard at Octavia. The [Alchemist] paused.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You haven’t eaten yet! Don’t pretend! I can tell when you haven’t—Lyonette!”</p>
<p>Erin opened the door to her inn and yelled into it.</p>
<p>“Get me some leftovers for Octavia, stat!”</p>
<p>Five minutes later, Octavia was eating from a plate as if she hadn’t eaten all week while Erin explained what she wanted.</p>
<p>“So what I want is a match stick, see? The thing you strike <em>and</em> the match box. Now, Ryoka says that the thing to make the side of the box is phosphorus. Um, red phosphorus.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea. It’s red, and uh, a rock, I think. It’s good for…igniting things?”</p>
<p>Erin raised her hands as Octavia’s face clearly showed what she thought of Erin’s description.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry! I don’t know! Ryoka could tell you more—ask her if you need details! But the match head is simple. It’s sulfur and other stuff. It just…lights up when you rub it on something. Like this.”</p>
<p>Octavia watched with interest as Erin demonstrated. She already had a sketch of the matches and matchbox, and she was tapping her fingers thoughtfully as she turned to look around her shop. At last she nodded.</p>
<p>“I can do some research and see what might work like this ‘phosphorus’. But look, Erin. <em>Anyone</em> can make fire with a flint and steel. Or a spell. And fire starters do exist. Ever seen a blaze bomb? Nasty. It’s made with the scales of a Ignition Salamander and Corusdeer horns you see, and when it explodes it—”</p>
<p>“I know it’s possible. But I bet it’s not cheap, right?”</p>
<p>“No…”</p>
<p>“This would be cheap. Really cheap. And easy! Okay, maybe people can use magic, but how many people use magic? And flint and steel is a pain to carry. Matches are useful—and sort of fun! I mean, I liked matches when I was a kid. Just try it, okay?”</p>
<p>“You’re paying me.”</p>
<p>Octavia shrugged and reached for her cup. Erin smiled.</p>
<p>“Now, the second thing I need is for you to experiment with mold.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Which kind?”</p>
<p>Erin paused. Octavia stared at her expectantly.</p>
<p>“I’ve got several growing in the back if you want any one particular kind.”</p>
<p>“Of course you do. Well, this one’s green and sort of blueish, and it grows on oranges and bread…”</p>
<p>“How much do you want? I don’t grow that, but I think I’ve got a loaf of bread in one of my cupboards that probably has that kind of mold.”</p>
<p>“Just…wait a second, okay? I need something specific. You see, I need penicillin, which is a special type of mold. It works like this…”</p>
<p>Octavia frowned as she listened to Erin’s description. When Erin was done, Octavia was willing to admit that penicillin might be very useful, but she had no idea how to figure out which mold would work like that.</p>
<p>“I guess I can experiment on myself? No? Well, perhaps a test subject. I guess I can get a pig or sheep or something and…no? Aw, come on. How about a rat? Aw, Erin—okay, I’ll do all I can. But I still have to run my shop. And brew potions. Honestly, the brewing is easier than the shop keeping—I need to stay behind the counter at all hours. But that’s going to cut into the amount of time I can keep researching, just so you know.”</p>
<p>Erin blinked at Octavia and a little candle lit up in her head.</p>
<p>“I can help with that. Come to the inn tonight for dinner and we can talk details.”</p>
<p>Octavia eyed Erin and then raised a hand.</p>
<p>“No way. Sorry, Erin, but no. Honestly, I appreciate the thought, but you’re no expert saleswoman, and I can’t just turn my merchandise over—wait, where are you going? I didn’t finish! I’ll let you try to sell my stuff if you’re willing to give me a cut of—”</p>
<p>Erin waved at Octavia as she exited the shop. The [Alchemist] frowned as the door—or rather, hinged piece of plywood—swung almost shut. She went over to it and pushed it closed, muttering under her breath.</p>
<p>“Gotta improve the pitch, Octavia. You have to get them hooked faster. Fifty percent? Hah! <em>Eighty percent</em> cut, and then you start laying on the little extras. Market value purchase plus city taxation, labor costs, regional import fees, cauldron taxes…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A minute after Erin had left Octavia’s shop she stopped and slapped a hand to her forehead. A passing horse and rider looked at her weirdly, but that was alright.</p>
<p>“Healing potion slimes! That’s right!”</p>
<p>Erin snapped her fingers and fished around for the piece of parchment to write that down. Then she went on her way.</p>
<p>There wasn’t enough time in the day for everything she needed to do. From Octavia’s, Erin made a beeline to the Frenzied Hare in Celum. She was a bit leery of inviting Agnes to the Christmas party, but happily the woman was out.</p>
<p>Unhappily, <em>everyone</em> was out of the Frenzied Hare. The doors were locked, and Erin had left her key to the building back in her inn. When she asked why it was closed, she learned that Miss Agnes had taken a holiday with her sick husband. That essentially meant spending all the coin Erin had helped her earn by staying at someone else’s inn and eating lavish food.</p>
<p>Erin just shook her head when she heard that and asked where she could find Wesle, Jasi, and the other actors. She was pointed to a building that had been bought out by the troupe of [Actors]—a freshly painted sign advertised nightly performances.</p>
<p>“Presents?”</p>
<p>Jasi blinked at Erin as she turned from their rehearsal of <em>My Fair [Lady]</em> to talk. Grev, hovering backstage with water and the scripts for the actors, looked up sharply.</p>
<p>“That’s right!”</p>
<p>Erin smiled at the younger Drake as she explained about Christmas for the umpteenth time. By the time she was done, Grev was a new convert to the dream of getting presents for free, and Jasi and some of the other [Actors] including Wesle were happy enough to join in Erin’s present-giving program.</p>
<p>“So you’ll tell us who we’re getting presents for, right? Can you tell us now? If it’s in two days, I’d like to get started shopping right away.”</p>
<p>“Uh—I’ll have a list by tonight!”</p>
<p>Erin promised the troupe as she tried to figure out how best to do that. She’d probably need a list. Or a diagram. She should have bought more parchment and ink!</p>
<p>Jasi caught Erin as the girl was getting ready to get back to her inn—this time to get ready for dinner.</p>
<p>“If you’re making everyone give gifts for each other in secret, do you mind if I ask that you let me buy a gift for Grev?”</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>Erin smiled at Jasi.</p>
<p>“You’ve gotta get one for him, and I’ll make him get one for you! Anyone else you want to put on the list? Maybe Wesle?”</p>
<p>“Maybe.”</p>
<p>Jasi blushed and fiddled with her claws as she looked the other way. Erin had a thought.</p>
<p>“Or maybe Olesm! He’s a Drake, like you! Not that it matters, but it could be a good way to introduce yourself to him. I know you don’t know many Drakes since you live in Celum…”</p>
<p>“Maybe not, Erin. I mean, I don’t know other Drakes. I wouldn’t know what to buy. But maybe instead of Wesle, you could put down that Pisces guy? He’s handsome.”</p>
<p>Jasi smiled. The smile faltered as Erin gave her a look flatter than paper. Without a word Erin backed towards the door and then shut it. Then she opened it again to smile.</p>
<p>“I’ll do my best!”</p>
<p>She paused.</p>
<p>“But seriously, no. Pisces? No.”</p>
<p>She shut the door again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That night, the Wandering Inn saw a record-breaking number of guests. Again. Word had spread about the game of Go, and Erin had more than a few visitors who came just to sit at the tables and play with the now vaguely-round stones.</p>
<p>There was a lot of competition, and Erin was touched to see the Antinium playing against Drakes and Gnolls with scarcely a second glance. Pawn and Belgrade were among the better players in the room, and that was including the mages and Olesm. Pisces seemed to have a knack for the game, but those who practiced strategy for a living still had an advantage over everyone else in the room.</p>
<p>Except for Erin. She was delighted beyond belief to have actually lost a game—an event which made Olesm race outside and dance about the inn for ten minutes straight—but she was still a better player than everyone else by sheer virtue of practice. But she was happy. Happy, though she was having trouble standing up. Her legs were <em>aching</em> and her arms hurt from hauling a bunch of frozen meat back to her inn.</p>
<p>Klbkch didn’t come that night, but Relc did. He slipped into the inn, hesitating a bit when he saw Erin. But she pretended not to see him at first, and instead helped Belgrade as he played a very close game against Olesm.</p>
<p>“Ooh, an apple!”</p>
<p>Relc spotted a plate with apple slices sitting on a table. After a surreptitious look around, he happily crunched down the slices, still as fresh and as crisp as when they’d been cut, which was yesterday.</p>
<p>Erin stared at Relc, and then smiled.</p>
<p>“Everything going well?”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>He jumped guiltily and then turned to her.</p>
<p>“Oh. Hey Erin.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Relc.”</p>
<p>They stood in silence for a few seconds. Then Erin gestured to the table.</p>
<p>“Want some food? Today’s dish is beef broth, mashed potatoes, roast beef, gravy, mushroom-and-meat skewers, boiled greens—those tube greens, you know—and honey-drizzled steamed carrots. What would you like?”</p>
<p>Relc gave Erin a pleading look.</p>
<p>“Can I have…everything?”</p>
<p>She smiled. Some things didn’t change. In this at least, she was glad.</p>
<p>“Sure. Coming right up!”</p>
<p>When he was eating happily, Erin sat with Relc and—talked. Just for a little bit.</p>
<p>“So you’ve really been good?”</p>
<p>He paused, licking the spoonful of potatoes with a long tongue.</p>
<p>“Can’t complain. That damn dungeon’s spitting out monsters now and then, but Captain Z’s got us guarding in shifts and we’ve built some fortifications. Really, the most annoying part is all the adventurers coming in and out.”</p>
<p>“Why, are they rude to you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! They look down their noses on the way in, and on the way out they run to us with their tails tucked between their legs, begging us to stop the icky monsters.”</p>
<p>Relc laughed and Erin smiled.</p>
<p>“Sounds like a lot of work. I’m just glad you’re okay.”</p>
<p>“Well…you know me. I’m tough!”</p>
<p>Relc thumped his chest and looked sideways at Erin.</p>
<p>“You got rid of that skeleton thing, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I had to.”</p>
<p>“Good. I mean, it was going to go bad. You can’t trust the undead.”</p>
<p>“I guess not.”</p>
<p>“And the uh, Goblins are gone. I didn’t do anything!”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>Silence. For once, Erin didn’t have much to say. Relc was a friend. He had been a friend. But after a while, she stood up.</p>
<p>“If you want anything else, just yell. Lyonette and I can handle it.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>Relc turned awkwardly to his food. Then he looked at Erin.</p>
<p>“That Gnoll kid you’ve got there—I heard some of the guys talking in the barracks about her. White fur’s bad, right?”</p>
<p>Erin hesitated.</p>
<p>“I think so. To Gnolls.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. But they’re stupid. It’s good that you took her in. Real good.”</p>
<p>Relc and Erin paused, full of words unspoken. Then Erin nodded and walked away. Someone was calling her name.</p>
<p>She chanced upon the Horns of Hammerad after she’d helped serve more alcohol. They were sitting at their own table, talking amongst themselves. The topic happened to be the items Ryoka had analyzed.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t get a reply from her, but what she said sounded good. Really good.”</p>
<p>Ceria told Erin as she slid into a seat. The half-Elf sounded like she was half-trying to convince herself. Yvlon nodded, as did Ksmvr, but Pisces looked less sanguine. Ceria began listing off the items, keeping her voice low as she whispered to Erin.</p>
<p>“A magical sword with the weight enchantment—a good one. That’s powerful. A buckler with a spelled defense? That’s Gold-rank gear right there, for Yvlon probably. And that dagger? Valuable. Pisces, you or I could use it, or Ksmvr could wield it in his off-hand…”</p>
<p>“And that’s all.”</p>
<p>Pisces took a deep draft from his tankard.</p>
<p>“That’s all, Springwalker. We don’t know more, so we don’t know if that’s it, or if Ryoka found something truly of worth.”</p>
<p>“She didn’t tell you anything else?”</p>
<p>Yvlon shook her head.</p>
<p>“She promised us that there’s more, but she was only willing to list those three weapons in case someone was reading our messages. I’d worry someone might try to steal the artifacts, but if she’s travelling in Magnolia Reinhart’s coach…”</p>
<p>“It might be that she was trying to spare our feelings.”</p>
<p>Pisces slumped in his chair. He seemed morose. Ceria shook her head.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that.”</p>
<p>“Why not? Those are all of the weapons we recovered. Save for the sword blade—broken. What else could be of worth?”</p>
<p>“Plenty. There was that bag of holding—and the enchantments on the weapons <em>are</em> powerful.”</p>
<p>“I suppose they are.”</p>
<p>Pisces sighed as Ceria began listing the things that might be hidden inside the bag of holding they’d found, or the adventurer’s pack. Yvlon listened, occasionally adding a suggestion, and Ksmvr sat, looking from Pisces to Ceria.</p>
<p>The Horns of Hammerad were more nervous than happy about the items Ryoka had identified. Erin wondered if there really were more artifacts than the three weapons. It didn’t matter. Either way, her goal was to raise their spirits, so Erin interrupted Ceria and began explaining Christmasian theory. Again.</p>
<p>“Presents? I guess we could go out shopping. Only…”</p>
<p>“I’ll lend you some money. You can pay me back. I know you’re good for it.”</p>
<p>“Some adventuring group we are.”</p>
<p>Yvlon shook her head, but she was smiling at the thought of Christmas.</p>
<p>“You know, we did something similar. It wasn’t something as large as a present, but we’d get sweets during the winter solstice. I used to look forwards to that every year.”</p>
<p>“Sweets is a good present! Uh, especially since I didn’t make the list yet.”</p>
<p>Erin winced as she realized she’d have to run around and tell everyone who their secret two people were tomorrow. She left the Horns of Hammerad as she spotted someone else in the crowd.</p>
<p>“Selys! <em>Selys!</em>”</p>
<p>“Erin! Where have you been? I haven’t seen you for ages!”</p>
<p>The two laughed and sat down at another table. Selys was just about to tell Erin all about her troubles managing the guild with so many new adventurers when Erin remembered her magical soups and hurried into the kitchen to get them. She called over Halrac and some of the other adventurers as she explained how they worked.</p>
<p>“What do you think? Can I interest you in any of it?”</p>
<p>Ulrien, Halrac, Seborn, and Selys all stared dubiously down into the jar of blue, thick soup Erin had opened. It did not look appetizing, but after a second Halrac picked up the jar. He sniffed it once, and then gulped a mouthful down. Selys shuddered. Halrac’s face didn’t change as he handed it to Ulrien.</p>
<p>“Not bad. We don’t need it, but I can mention it to some [Scouts] I know.”</p>
<p>“You think they’d want it?”</p>
<p>Halrac raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“This? Oh yes. If they can move around with less clothing on, it’s less to carry and less noise. They’ll buy it.”</p>
<p>“Adventurers too. Anyone wearing armor in the snow will want this.”</p>
<p>Ulrien made a face as he swallowed. He pushed the jar over to Selys. The Drake raised her hands.</p>
<p>“I can get grandma—uh, the Guild to sell this. But I’m not drinking it.”</p>
<p>“Aw. Come on Selys, it’s not <em>that</em> bad. And it works! Just try it!”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Please?”</p>
<p>“No, Erin.”</p>
<p>“Pretty please?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Well, okay. But wait until you see <em>this</em> potion! It makes your skin tough! Do you want to try it, Seborn?”</p>
<p>Sitting across the room, drinking some hot beef broth and wondering if she could get in on Erin’s business transaction, Octavia was just about to get up when a shadow blocked the light. She looked up and saw a Gnoll.</p>
<p>That wasn’t surprising around Liscor, Gnolls being a good percentage of the city’s population. But Octavia had met few Gnolls in Celum. She gulped as this one loomed over her. It—she—spoke in a deep, growling voice.</p>
<p>“Hrm. You are Octavia, yes?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>Octavia squeaked. Krshia smiled, baring all of her teeth.</p>
<p>“I am Krshia. A [Shopkeeper]. I am told you may wish to let me sell your potions, yes? Let us talk business.”</p>
<p>“You? But I—did Erin—”</p>
<p>Octavia glanced helplessly towards Erin, but Krshia had already pulled out a seat. Octavia did her best to pull herself together. A customer was a customer, and she was a master at selling.</p>
<p>“Well, Miss, uh, Krshia, I’m one of the three best [Alchemists] in Celum. I don’t like to brag, but I’ve sold potions to Gold-rank adventurers and I get commissioned regularly to do research creating new potions. Now, my brews might not be the most standard, but I can assure you that my percentage is quite reasonable. A fifty percent cut of all profits is a good place to start, but I could—”</p>
<p>“Mm. What is your level?”</p>
<p>The [Alchemist] broke off nervously. Krshia was just staring at her, unblinkingly.</p>
<p>“My—my level? Well, I think that’s a personal issue, and as we all know, levels don’t always correspond to Skills of c—”</p>
<p>“I will sell your potions, but if they are lower quality, I must price them as such, yes? And then…well, we shall see. I have many levels in my class, and that must be weighed, yes? If I, a high-level [Shopkeeper], were to sell your potions, I should get a better cut, yes?”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, but no, but—let’s talk effort here. I’m brewing the potions—”</p>
<p>“But I sell them, yes? I must sell your potions. If I do not sell, no one will buy, yes? So which is more important?”</p>
<p>“Hold on—if I didn’t make potions—”</p>
<p>Octavia’s mouth was dry, but she didn’t dare take a sip from her cup. She was fighting for something far more important than her life. The battle for the bigger bottom line was fought quietly in one corner of the inn. Tears were shed, and a little bit of blood. But on the whole, Erin thought she’d done a good job, especially when she saw the look on Octavia’s face afterwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s a pain in the ass.”</p>
<p>Halrac was talking to Erin at a table late at night. She was trying to look as attentive as possible. She hadn’t gotten a chance to speak with him since she’d come back, and she knew the man wanted to talk with her, even if he wouldn’t say it.</p>
<p>That was how the night was going. Sit at a table and chat. But don’t sit too long, because someone else would want to speak with her. Erin’s eyes hurt. She wanted to close them, but her friends were more important.</p>
<p>“How’s it a pain? I mean, this <em>is</em> a dungeon so I know there’s lots of monsters…”</p>
<p>“Monsters we could handle. If it were a nest we’d deplete their numbers and destroy their home. But this is a magical dungeon, one where the rooms keep changing. A trap room we disarm one day might be gone the next, and in its place an entirely new trap, or a room full of monsters.”</p>
<p>“And the traps are really bad, right? I’ve heard stories from Relc.”</p>
<p>“They’re some of the worst I’ve seen.”</p>
<p>Halrac shook his head, looking grimmer than usual.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen deadlier—the one that got your friends is probably worse than most of the ones in this dungeon. But there are so many that we can’t make any headway. And when we come back the next day…”</p>
<p>“They’ve changed.”</p>
<p>Erin whistled quietly and Halrac nodded. He took a sip of the drink Erin had made especially for him. There was just a drop of the faerie flower nectar in it, enough to take the edge of the day off.</p>
<p>“So far, a lot of kids have gotten killed and the others are making no headway. We’re the only group that’s gone in, and we have nothing to show for it.”</p>
<p>“Is there any hope? Or do you just…have to get lucky?”</p>
<p>Halrac shrugged.</p>
<p>“Right now we’re trying to identify all the rooms on rotation. If we can figure out the trick behind most of them, we might be able to break through to the next area. Then it’s just a matter of anchoring ourselves at that point. There are ways to stop a magical dungeon from changing. But it’s the crevasse the Mrsha child found that interests me. It goes straight down into another part of the dungeon.”</p>
<p>“And that’s good, right?”</p>
<p>“Maybe.”</p>
<p>The [Scout] seemed incapable of optimism. For good reason, as he explained to Erin.</p>
<p>“The problem with that is if we go down there, we’re walking into an attack on all sides. Multiple traps with wide ranges might come at us, and there are plenty of strong monsters down there. The dungeon is <em>infested</em>. When we went down to save the child, we ran into eight different species, some of which were fighting each other. If we hadn’t all been high-level, we wouldn’t have made it out.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for doing that, Halrac.”</p>
<p>“It was nothing. You should thank Zel Shivertail instead. He was the one who killed the most monsters.”</p>
<p>“Do you think he’d like to go into the dungeon with you guys?”</p>
<p>Erin saw Halrac smile, just once. She smiled too; her mission was partly accomplished.</p>
<p>“Him? He’s no adventurer. I wouldn’t have ever expected to fight beside him, but it was…good to see. But he wouldn’t risk his neck down there. It’ll be us.”</p>
<p>“And it’s worth doing?”</p>
<p>“Who knows?”</p>
<p>Halrac raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“There could be nothing down there, or an artifact beyond our wildest imagination. But we’re going to look anyways, because that’s what adventurers do.”</p>
<p>“Well, you can stay as long as you like. And I’ll have good food and a warm bed for you—and I want to see if Pisces really can rig up some kind of emergency teleport stone. If he does…I want you to all have one.”</p>
<p>Halrac smiled.</p>
<p>“You’re an odd [Innkeeper], Miss Solstice.”</p>
<p>“I know!”</p>
<p>“Thank you. It’s…pleasant being here.”</p>
<p>Erin smiled at him, and felt her eyes threatening to close.</p>
<p>“That’s all I want to hear. Would you like a refill?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then it was night time. Somehow, everyone had vanished, leaving Erin alone in her inn. She sat at a table, head resting against the wall. It was dark. Snow was falling. Everyone had gone.</p>
<p>And Erin was beyond tired. She was so tired she had passed into that special realm where she was too tired to sleep. She stared out the window as the snow fell and made to bury the world. One last hurrah, before the weather turned and the world slowly began to warm.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be very, very deep tomorrow…I’ll have to shovel it…can’t open the door I bet…”</p>
<p>Erin murmured dreamily to herself, slurring the words. They were just fragments of thought, things she had to do. She had so much to do.</p>
<p>“I forgot to get a Christmas tree. Oh well. I guess I can try tomorrow…”</p>
<p>One day to get everyone to buy presents. She had to figure out who would get what first—probably before she talked to anyone. So now or before dawn. And Erin had to get presents herself, get ready for the party—buy more food, figure out traditional Christmasy foods, decorate the inn…</p>
<p>If she pushed the date back she’d have more time. But Christmas came before the New Year’s, didn’t it? And the winter solstice was…well, as close to a New Year as this world had. The Frost Faeries probably only cared about the solstice, anyways.</p>
<p>“Solstice.”</p>
<p>Erin stared out the window. She breathed and the glass fogged up. Erin wiped away the condensation and stared into the snowy landscape.</p>
<p>So tired. But she’d done good, hadn’t she? She’d brought a game to this world, talked with everyone, helped Krshia, Octavia…but she was tired.</p>
<p>So tired. She’d wake up in a few hours. Before dawn. She had a lot to do. So Erin should sleep. She knew that. But she was too tired for that. She just wanted—well, she wanted so many things. But right now she just wanted to sleep.</p>
<p>Was today a bad day? No, it was good. Then why did Erin feel hollow inside? Miserable? Why would she feel like that?</p>
<p>If you’re sad, just smile. Had someone told Erin that once? Or was it just something she’d grown up knowing?</p>
<p>Her lips twitched. Erin smiled, and then let it fade. She stared out of the window, resting her head against the wall. Not crying. Not smiling. Just staring.</p>
<p>She felt just a little bit tired.</p>
<p>At some point, Erin fell asleep. But she wasn’t quite asleep. She hovered between waking and slumber, so that reality became a dream, but she was still thinking.</p>
<p>Smiles. She’d seen them today. That was what she’d set out to collect, like Santa getting his presents or the tooth faerie flying from bed to bed. They were such brief things, smiles. But they were so valuable. And Erin had collected so many…</p>
<p>A smile from Krshia. Brunkr’s bared teeth, determined, hopeful. Mrsha’s big smile as she licked honey off a paw. Lyonette’s mischievous grin as she fed Revi mushrooms. Relc happily eating the apple. Octavia and her gold. Jasi, performing. Bird, eating bees…</p>
<p>Fragments. In her dream, Erin reached out and gathered the glowing shards to herself. They were the one light in a dark world filled with snow. But when she touched them, they melted and dripped from her hand. They fell down into the blackness and became stars. Erin looked down and found herself staring up into the sky. The clouds were gone, and the stars shone down. She smiled then, and she was smiling when Lyonette found her asleep the next day.</p>
<p>And the word that spread through the city, through two cities, was simple. It was a word never heard in this world before, a word that would not topple kings from their thrones or start revolutions. But it was a special word, nonetheless. It was something new, something that might be important, or might not. It was as important as people thought it was. But it was special to the girl who lay sleeping in her inn, too tired to lie down. It meant happiness. It was a word for joy, a word for the season. A word of power. A word from home.</p>
<p>A memory.</p>
<p>Christmas.</p>

		<p>When Ryoka left the Mage’s Guild she found Reynold waiting for her. The young woman was not surprised; she let the [Butler] fall into step beside her as she walked slowly down the street.</p>
<p>Reynold was not smiling. Not that he was usually beaming; but he normally carried himself with professional impartiality. Right now he was <em>not</em> smiling and it was quite clear he was also not happy.</p>
<p>“Miss Ryoka. I trust your visit to the Mage’s Guild was eventful?”</p>
<p>“You tell me.”</p>
<p>“I trust I conveyed Lady Reinhart’s wishes to you earlier? My duty is to accompany you as an escort—”</p>
<p>“Yeah. But I’ll just bet that I had other people watching me while you were busy with Laken. Stop glaring, Reynold. I’m not in a good mood right now.”</p>
<p>Reynold glared, but he decided to shut his mouth after a second of wavering. Ryoka saw him glancing at her face. In truth, she wasn’t angry. She was more tired. No; tired wasn’t the right word.</p>
<p>Valceif Godfrey was dead. It felt like no one in the world knew or cared. But Ryoka did. She cared, but she had to finish her job here. Then she could go back and—tell everyone. Tell Erin, and Hawk, at least.</p>
<p>“How’d it go in the Merchant’s Guild?”</p>
<p>Ryoka frowned at the sky as she spoke. It was quite dark, although it shouldn’t have been so early. The clouds had completely obscured the sun and snow was beginning to fall. A <em>lot</em> of snow.</p>
<p>The [Butler]’s voice was testy as he replied.</p>
<p>“Mister Laken has concluded most of his business to his satisfaction. A shipment of goods and food has been paid for—and two adventuring teams have been contacted. If all goes well, they should be ready to begin transport this very night.”</p>
<p>“Good. Thanks for helping him.”</p>
<p>“It was my pleasure, Miss Ryoka. It is my privilege to serve others in need of my assistance…whether I like it or not, apparently.”</p>
<p>“Hah. You’re a lot more fun when you’re upset, Reynold.”</p>
<p>Ryoka half-smiled as she turned to look at him. Then she looked up again. Ryoka frowned and prodded at her belt pouch.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe? Hey, Ivolethe. What’s with all this crap floating down? We’re already up to our knees in the snow; why do we need <em>more?</em>”</p>
<p>She saw the pouch at her belt rustling, and then Ivolethe poked her head out. The Frost Faerie grinned as she spread her arms wide at the dark, snowy sky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Ah, you see it? Do you see your doom, floating down from above? Prepare for wrack and ruin, ye mortals! This snowstorm will be the greatest in a century, nay, in ten thousand years! The snow will cover the earth and leave none alive! This is the dawn of a new age of ice and woe! Alack! Despair!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka stared down at Ivolethe with narrowed eyes. The faerie stared back, blinking innocently.</p>
<p>“What does ah, Miss Ivolethe have to say, Miss Ryoka?”</p>
<p>“She says we’re all doomed.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>“Yep.”</p>
<p>The two Humans didn’t react the way Ivolethe was hoping for. She scowled, and then answered in a sulky tone of voice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“A blizzard comes. You will see it become strongest by nightfall. It will last two…nay, three days at most. If you hide in your small huts of wood and stone, you should be fine.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Thanks for the weather update. Buh-bye.”</p>
<p>Ryoka closed the lid on her belt pouch. Ivolethe made a sound of pure outrage; Ryoka winced as her pouch instantly frosted over. The faerie pushed the lid open as Ryoka turned to Reynold.</p>
<p>“Is Laken still at the Guild? I want to speak with him.”</p>
<p>“I believe he has retired to his lodgings for the moment, Miss Ryoka.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Where are they?”</p>
<p>“I regret to say that he did not inform me.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Where <em>are</em> they?”</p>
<p>Ryoka stopped and turned to face Reynold. She folded her arms and scowled at him.</p>
<p>“Don’t play games, Reynold. I know that someone followed them.”</p>
<p>He just shook his head, stepping to one side to allow a group of laughing Gnolls to pass him by.</p>
<p>“Miss Ryoka, you assume that other servants under Lady Reinhart’s employ would be following you. I regret to inform you that this is not the case. There are a finite number of people who serve her, and it is hardly useful to send a [Maid] or a [Waiter] to follow someone.”</p>
<p>Ryoka rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“Look, Reynold. I don’t have to see someone to know they’re there. I know Magnolia’s type. Someone’s following me, and probably Laken as well by now. Now, we can wander around while you pretend you have no idea where Laken is, or we can skip that and just ask your friends.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I cannot help you, Miss Griffin.”</p>
<p>“Right. In that case—Ivolethe? Where’s the nearest spy?”</p>
<p>The Frost Faerie, who’d been poking her head out of Ryoka’s belt pouch, brightened up. She smiled wickedly at Reynold. He was shaking his head almost imperceptibly at her. But Ivolethe ignored that as she gleefully pointed a finger into the crowd of pedestrians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“<em>There!</em>”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka turned her head and saw an old man with a horrible skin condition—some kind of puffy warts on the right side of his face—slowly moving down the other side of the street. She ignored Reynold as he tried to block her and strode right for the man.</p>
<p>“Hey, you.”</p>
<p>The old man didn’t notice Ryoka at first, but he eventually stopped when she stepped in front of him and blocked his way. He swayed back, staring uncertainly at her—and then avidly at her breasts. He looked confused as Ryoka stared at him.</p>
<p>“Eh? What do you want, Miss?”</p>
<p>The young woman ignored the scrutiny. She stared down at the elderly man as Reynold hurried to her side, looking anxious.</p>
<p>“Where is Laken Godart?”</p>
<p>“Who? I don’t know who that is. What do you want?”</p>
<p>He tried to move past Ryoka. She blocked his way again. Now the old man was looking anxious. He looked exactly like an old guy – he even smelled old, if old was a smell. Nonenal, Ryoka thought it was called. She glanced down at her belt pouch, suddenly not entirely certain.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe, I swear, if you’re messing with me I’ll be really pissed.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I’m not!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Miss Ryoka, please—”</p>
<p>Ryoka turned to glare at the [Butler].</p>
<p>“Shut up, Reynold. Look, I know you’re in Magnolia Reinhart’s employ. Are you going to give up the act, or do I have to make a scene?”</p>
<p>Ryoka stared down at the old man, not quite making a fist. The old man glanced at Reynold. The [Butler] spread his arms helplessly behind Ryoka’s back. After a second, the old man sighed. He reached for a ring on one of his gnarled fingers and <em>twisted</em>—</p>
<p>A [Maid], wearing a frilled dress and peeved expression on her face, straightened up in the middle of the street where the old man had been standing. The people around her did a double take, but Ryoka just smiled.</p>
<p>“Nice ring.”</p>
<p>The woman was in her late twenties, or early thirties. She had a tight bun of dark brown hair and an expression that naturally lent itself towards severity. Or maybe she just had a Skill that made her look that way. She didn’t quite glare at Ryoka.</p>
<p>“This way, Miss Ryoka. Your friend is staying at the Crag Pig, quite a few streets away from here. If you will follow me…?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a short and uneventful walk to the inn Laken was staying at. Uneventful for Ryoka, that was. Reynold kept his head bowed and shoulders hunched as he and the mysterious [Maid] walked ahead of Ryoka. She could see the [Maid] speaking to Reynold the entire way, and Ryoka was fairly sure what was being said weren’t compliments.</p>
<p>She felt a bit bad for Reynold. But just a bit. Ryoka was grateful for the speed at which both servants walked—they moved fast down the most crowded of streets. Their attire made them stand out, and Ryoka saw them getting a lot of looks as she followed them.</p>
<p>It was funny. Ryoka smiled as she walked. When the two of Magnolia’s servants turned back to look at her, they saw her smiling and staring down at the fat snowflakes swirling down from the sky.</p>
<p>It was a look seldom seen on Ryoka’s face. But Ryoka had just realized the silliness of her situation. She was following a [Butler] and a [Maid] down a street in a city that could have come from her world with a few alterations, carrying a Frost Faerie in her belt pouch.</p>
<p>It was just so silly. And sad. That Ryoka could smile made it a bit better.</p>
<p>She stared up at the inn as the [Maid] led them to it. Ryoka ignored the woman as she stepped away from Reynold and practically vanished into the next crowd of Humans.</p>
<p>The Crag Pig was an inn with the head of, well, probably a Crag Pig mounted on the front. This skull was quite, quite big, and had a pair of tusks that curved slightly upwards. They were long, jagged—and branched, like the horns of an antler. Ryoka wondered if that was because they were useful in the Crag Pig’s natural habitat, or whether the skull being here was a testament to their qualities.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess I’d better have a chat. Reynold, if you would?”</p>
<p>The [Butler] opened the doors and Ryoka walked in. Her first impression of the inn was that it was definitely <em>not</em> as nice as Erin’s. The Crag Pig’s owner must have thought that the name of his inn excused the dirt, or else the name was a warning.</p>
<p>Still, the room was packed and a fire was taking the chill off. Ryoka looked around and saw a man and a woman waiting the tables, but no [Innkeeper]. She shrugged, found the stairs, and headed towards them.</p>
<p>“Welcome, sir! Let me find you a table. Please—I’ll have a seat for you and a hot drink right away!”</p>
<p>To her amusement, Ryoka saw a big man—a former adventurer perhaps—hurry out of the kitchen and accost Reynold as he tried to follow her. The owner of the inn had scars all over his arms, and he was trying to usher the protesting Reynold into a seat.</p>
<p>There were flaws with being impeccably dressed after all. Not that Reynold’s attire would be so dashing if he sat down in one of the chairs in this inn. Ryoka shook her head as she went up the stairs two at a time.</p>
<p>“Now, where’s Laken…? Ah.”</p>
<p>It was the work of five seconds to find Laken’s room. Not because the door was open or Ryoka spotted anyone coming out; there was simply only one room that could conceivably hold someone of Durene’s size. It was probably the master suite.</p>
<p>Ryoka headed towards the door and knocked twice.</p>
<p>“Laken? It’s me, Ryoka Griffin.”</p>
<p>Someone had been talking inside the room. When Ryoka knocked, the voice stopped abruptly. Ryoka listened for sounds of movement, but heard none.</p>
<p>It was a surprise, then, when the door opened and Ryoka saw Durene staring down at her. For such a big girl, Durene could move quite silently.</p>
<p>“Hi. Durene, right? Is Laken inside? I want to talk with him.”</p>
<p>“He’s inside.”</p>
<p>The young woman nodded and tried to walk inside. But a very thick, grey-skinned arm shot out to block her. Ryoka looked up and saw Durene staring down at her.</p>
<p>“Please move. I’m just going to talk to him.”</p>
<p>“You ran away earlier. And you haven’t said why you’re here.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I had something to do.”</p>
<p>Ryoka stared up at Durene. The half-Troll girl was hostile, but…Ryoka thought it was more than just wariness around Ryoka.</p>
<p>“I don’t trust you.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Possessiveness, that was it. Ryoka remembered how Durene hovered around Laken. She was treating him like…</p>
<p>A few thoughts flashed through Ryoka’s mind. Dependency? Probably. She could imagine what might occur when Laken had come to this world. Blind guy meets half-Troll. A reverse case of Beauty and the Beast. But the beast is actually a girl who was afraid of losing the one person who didn’t fear her.</p>
<p>“I’m not your enemy. And I’m not going to do anything to Laken. I just want to talk with him.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Ryoka bit her tongue. Durene’s tone told her there was no good answer she could give. She knew that because it was the exact same tone of voice she used to use when talking with her father.</p>
<p>“Look, is Laken in there? Laken—”</p>
<p>“He’s sleeping. You can come back later.”</p>
<p>Durene shifted so more of her body was in the way. Ryoka stared up at her. Well, there were several ways this could go.</p>
<p>“Can you wake him up? I need to talk to him now. I’m sorry if that’s a problem, but it’s urgent.”</p>
<p>“No. He’s tired. You can come back later. If you try to come in, I’ll stop you.”</p>
<p>One of Durene’s hands closed. Ryoka eyed it and put her hands on her belt. She knew Ivolethe was sitting in her belt pouch, but it wasn’t that Ryoka was reaching for. At her belt, there were several potions Octavia had given her. Ryoka put her fingers on one of them, second from the right.</p>
<p>“Look, I understand you’re Laken’s…protector. And girlfriend. I’m not here to do anything to him, but I <em>need </em>to talk with him. And you shouldn’t start a fight here.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah? Why not? I could stop you.”</p>
<p>“No, you couldn’t.”</p>
<p>Ryoka sighed. She yanked the potion free from her belt in one move. Durene blinked down at it. Ryoka put her thumb on the cork—</p>
<p>And handed it to Durene.</p>
<p>“Here.”</p>
<p>The huge girl stared dumbfounded at the potion. She peered at Ryoka suspiciously.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“A pepper potion. Toss it at your opponent and they’ll go blind. Be careful—if it gets in your eyes you’ll be screaming about it all day. If you’re going to go around picking fights, at least get some magical items and a weapon.”</p>
<p>Durene looked uneasy as she held the potion.</p>
<p>“Were you going to hit me with this?”</p>
<p>“No, I’d use a spell and blind you first and <em>then</em> I’d hit you with the potion. Actually, I’d probably just blow up this entire corridor and run downstairs while everything burns down.”</p>
<p>Ryoka had two bags of compressed flour and the blaze potions. She didn’t know if it would actually hurt Durene that badly; she had a feeling that would only piss the girl off. But it made Durene stop and think.</p>
<p>“Keep the potion. You’ll probably need it. If it’s you—you could probably pour it on your hands and just punch people in the face. Not that they’re likely to get up after you hit them, but it’s a thought. Just don’t touch your eyes until after you’ve washed them thoroughly—with soap. Can I talk to Laken now?”</p>
<p>Durene just stared at Ryoka. She hesitated, looked down at the potion with bits of red pepper floating in it, and over her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Wait here. I’ll wake him up.”</p>
<p>Ryoka waited patiently. She heard Reynold come up the stairs—the [Butler] looked as though he’d had to tear himself physically away from the innkeeper.</p>
<p>A few voices muttered inside, and then the door opened. Durene let Ryoka walk in, but blocked Reynold.</p>
<p>“Ryoka can talk. Everyone else stays outside.”</p>
<p>Reynold protested, but Ryoka didn’t hear his conversation with Durene. The first thing she saw when entering Laken’s room made her stop in place. Because she’d seen Frostwing.</p>
<p>The baby bird was snoozing on a little platform made into a nest for him. He was surrounded by a warm blanket, and his ‘nest’ was more ripped-up shreds of fabric than actual cloth. It was also stained quite badly with his droppings. But the bird shone in Ryoka’s gaze.</p>
<p>“Wow.”</p>
<p>He looked like an eagle. Well, vaguely like an eagle. Ryoka had never studied bird species, but she knew only one kind of bird grew that big.</p>
<p>No—if size was the comparison, than Frostwing was more like an albatross than an eagle. Because he was clearly young, still a nestling, but he was almost the size of a full-grown chicken already.</p>
<p>And he was blue. That was the important thing. Frostwing’s feathers glittered in the light as he opened and flapped his wings, protesting this stranger’s intrusion into his home. Ryoka saw each feather glittering like a jewel; they had a subtle gradient that made the dark oxford blue of the inner part of each feather fade to a brilliant sky blue on the tips.</p>
<p>A blue bird. But not any bird. For a second, Ryoka was lost to the world. She was in another place, sitting on the balcony in her home, ten years old, holding a Gameboy and playing the video game that had defined her life at that time—</p>
<p>“Ryoka? Is that you?”</p>
<p>She looked up. Laken was sitting on the large bed, yawning and turning his head around the room. A young man was standing by his side, offering him assistance that Laken clearly didn’t need.</p>
<p>Laken, and…Gamel, was it?</p>
<p>“I’m here, Laken.”</p>
<p>Ryoka approached the bed. That was a bad move. She was still staring at Frostwing—too long. The bird may have been a child, but it had instincts that made it wary of anything that stared at it.</p>
<p>Frostwing <em>shrieked</em> his displeasure. Durene backed away, covering her ears as Gamel tried unsuccessfully to sooth the agitated young bird. Ryoka just stared as Frostwing spread his wings, shedding brilliant blue feathers onto the ground.</p>
<p>“Oh for the love of—here!”</p>
<p>Laken turned, frowning, and fumbled his way towards Frostwing. He reached out and the bird shut up as one of his hands found a piece of dried meat and offered it to the bird.</p>
<p>“Shh, Frostwing. Shut up. There’s a good bird.”</p>
<p>Laken stroked the crest on Frostwing’s head and the bird stopped shrieking. It tore greedily at the bit of meat and Laken turned to Ryoka, looking sheepish.</p>
<p>“Sorry. Pet bird. I’ve had to apologize to the innkeeper already. At least he wasn’t doing this in the middle of the night this time. It <em>is</em> daytime, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. I’m here to talk some more. Sorry about dropping in unexpectedly.”</p>
<p>“No it’s no problem—”</p>
<p>Laken rubbed at his face. He looked tired.</p>
<p>“Ah…Gamel?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir?”</p>
<p>“Can you…get me something to drink? And a snack, maybe? Durene, did I hear someone else was here?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s that [Butler]. Reynold.”</p>
<p>“Mister Laken, I apologize for the intrusion. But—”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. Okay, Gamel, I’ll handle Frostwing. He doesn’t need food—he just needs to take another nap. Durene, please guard the door? I think I need to talk to Ryoka. Alone.”</p>
<p>“Okay, Laken.”</p>
<p>There was something about Laken. When he spoke, things got done. Ryoka watched the protesting Reynold get slowly pushed out the door. She waved at him before Durene closed the door. Laken sat on the edge of his bed, slowly petting Frostwing as the bird rubbed its head against his palm.</p>
<p>“You have a bird.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Ryoka, meet Frostwing. Frostwing—don’t nip my fingers.”</p>
<p>Ryoka stared at Frostwing. Her eyes turned back to Laken.</p>
<p>“You have a bird. It’s blue.”</p>
<p>He frowned.</p>
<p>“Yes—yes I do. I found Frostwing near Durene’s cottage. I think his mother died of starvation or—something else. I took Frostwing in. I actually have a class from raising him. [Beast Tamer].”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>Ryoka stared at Frostwing. She felt like she had to repeat herself.</p>
<p>“It’s blue. I—excuse me.”</p>
<p>She reached for her pocket as Laken frowned. She knew it was stupid, but Ryoka had to do this. She pulled her iPhone out of her pocket and turned it on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laken was still a bit bleary from waking up, but he was trying to get his thoughts together quickly. Ryoka was here. That was good. He had so many questions he wanted to ask her, but he had to be careful, didn’t he? He wasn’t sure of her. Not yet. But she was<em> from his world.</em> Or—and here his cautious self spoke up—she was pretending to be. Could this all be a ploy? Her knowing German meant someone had come from another world, but maybe she was using a Skill? Was that possible?</p>
<p>Ryoka wasn’t saying much. She seemed to be fixated on Frostwing. Was it really that special that he was blue? Laken tried to remember if there were other blue birds back home. Obviously he’d never seen any, but…blue birds, what about them? What made Frostwing stand out that much?</p>
<p>Then he heard something. It was faint, muffled, and familiar. Laken frowned.</p>
<p>“Ryoka? Are you there?”</p>
<p>No response. Laken hesitated, and then leaned towards the source of the muted music. His eyes widened.</p>
<p>“Is that…is that the Pokemon theme song?”</p>
<p>Ryoka pulled the earbuds out.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“It <em>is!</em>”</p>
<p>Laken smiled and laughed.</p>
<p>“You’re a Pokemon fan!”</p>
<p>“I was. Once. A long time ago.”</p>
<p>Ryoka shifted, coughed. Laken couldn’t see, but she’d turned bright red. Laken grinned.</p>
<p>“Does Frostwing remind you of a Pokemon that much?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. He looks like Articuno, you know?”</p>
<p>“That’s a Pokemon?”</p>
<p>“A legendary. One of the legendary birds from the original one hundred and fifty.”</p>
<p>“Ah. I never actually played Pokemon growing up. Sort of hard when you can’t see anything.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Right.”</p>
<p>Ryoka coughed again, clearly embarrassed. Laken was smiling so hard it hurt. For just a few moments, he felt like he was back home, back in his world.</p>
<p>“You’re a fan. I had no idea. Did you play that new thing coming out? Pokemon Go?”</p>
<p>“I uh, a bit. It was a long time ago. Or it feels like it. I…was teleported here a few days after I downloaded the app, actually.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>The conversation fell flat in an instant. Ryoka shifted as she glanced at Frostwing again. Laken blinked and gestured with his other hand.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry. Please, sit. I don’t know where the chair is, but I’m assured we have at least two.”</p>
<p>“I see it.”</p>
<p>Ryoka dragged the chair over as Laken tried to make Frostwing go to sleep. He thought it worked, or at least, the bird had given up moving. He turned and sat cross-legged on his bed as he faced in Ryoka’s direction.</p>
<p>“I think Durene gave you some trouble as I was sleeping. Is that right?”</p>
<p>“Just a bit. She’s protective of you.”</p>
<p>Laken smiled wryly.</p>
<p>“She is. Thank you for not hitting her with that potion.”</p>
<p>Ryoka shrugged, and then remembered Laken couldn’t see any of her gestures.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. Good thing we didn’t meet a month or two ago or I’d have gotten my head pushed through a wall.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“I picked a fight with a Minotaur one time. That was one of the dumber things I’ve ever done.”</p>
<p>“Minotaurs exist in this world?”</p>
<p>“Yup. They’re touchy and prideful. And fairly rude, but they are honorable.”</p>
<p>“Fascinating. I’ve heard this continent has mainly…Gnolls, is it? And Drakes?”</p>
<p>“They inhabit the southern parts, yes. Invrisil is sort of an exception—it’s a major city so a lot of races come here. But you’ll generally find only Humans in the north.”</p>
<p>“I understand. Durene’s village is totally Human save for her.”</p>
<p>“Hm.”</p>
<p>The two sat in silence for another second. Ryoka sat still in her chair; Laken wiggled around, wondering if there was something that he was sitting on. A fork, maybe? Whatever it was, it was poking into his butt.</p>
<p>Unnoticed by the two of them, a third being was present in the room, listening. Ivolethe sat in Ryoka’s pouch, listening carefully. The Frost Faerie considered that her sisters would have hated the conversation between Ryoka and Laken. It wasn’t a thing of majesty or destiny. But it was important.</p>
<p>“I guess we should talk.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I guess we should.”</p>
<p>The boy and girl sat across from each other. They were old, but still young by the way the faerie reckoned such things. They had gone through sorrows, gone through trials. But they were still young. So young.</p>
<p>It was the girl who spoke first. She hesitated as she chewed at a lip, glancing towards the closed doors. Durene and Gamel stood behind it, but Ryoka knew the danger wasn’t something she could see.</p>
<p>“It’s complicated, you know? I want to say what’s on my mind but—”</p>
<p>“You did mention. Watchers and such.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. But if we assume we lost them or they can’t hear us—which I don’t—I’m fairly certain someone’s using magic to listen in.”</p>
<p>Laken raised his eyebrows calmly.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not like we have anything to hide.”</p>
<p>“Hah.”</p>
<p>“Okay, fine. But how are you proposing we solve this problem? I have something I need to say which will clarify things.”</p>
<p>“I’m in the same boat. I can say that I have a friend—Erin Solstice who’s from our world straight off, but the rest is harder.”</p>
<p>“Someone else? You mentioned that—what’s she like?”</p>
<p>“Age wise? She’s twenty. Besides that, she’s…a normal girl. Sort of. She’s American, like me.”</p>
<p>“Interesting. I’m twenty-four. Not American. Can I assume you’re around that age?”</p>
<p>“Twenty one. You don’t look that old. You’re part German. Is there another half?”</p>
<p>Laken smiled.</p>
<p>“My mom’s German, but she married my dad in France. I’ve grown up all over Europe, though. As to my face—I’m told I have a youthful complexion.”</p>
<p>Ryoka had to smile. She glanced at the door and frowned.</p>
<p>“Good to know. I don’t think any of this is too bad to mention, but the rest…damn, I don’t know. Erin would probably come up with some special way of figuring this out. Flush out the spies with a crazy scheme and dispel the enchantments with an insane trick or just luck.”</p>
<p>“She sounds quite interesting.”</p>
<p>“She’s an [Innkeeper]. Look, I’m getting annoyed. Maybe we should just go for broke. What do you think? I doubt anyone knows German.”</p>
<p>“Wahrscheinlich. But can <em>you</em> speak it? I don’t want to be rude, but your pronunciation—”</p>
<p>“I know. But I’ve got a dictionary-encyclopedia. It’s an app—I might have to ask for spelling, but I can translate short sentences.”</p>
<p>“That’s…amazingly useful. In that case, translate this. Ich bin ein [Kaiser].”</p>
<p>It took Ryoka only a second to figure out what Laken had said. She didn’t need to use her iPhone. Instead, she dropped it. She fumbled around on the ground, heart beating wildly. When she sat back up she stared at Laken’s face.</p>
<p>“You’re lying.”</p>
<p>“I’m not. I know it’s surprising, but it’s true. What about you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t have a class. I’m a Runner without the class. But you—get out.”</p>
<p>“It’s true!”</p>
<p>Laken smiled. He had no way of seeing Ryoka’s face, but her tone made her feelings clear.</p>
<p>“No, seriously, get out. Run away as far as you can. Do you have any idea how <em>bad</em> that is?”</p>
<p>“Bad? Why? Because of your—your Daenerys-like friend?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Not just her—Ivolethe!”</p>
<p>Ryoka shouted the faerie’s name. Laken jumped, and then gaped as the faerie floated upwards and spoke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“What do ye want, Ryoka?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Go downstairs and flush out the spies. Please? And if there are enchantments, dispel them. Please. This is important.”</p>
<p>The faerie considered the request. Then she reluctantly nodded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I shall bring havoc! From the outside.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She flew out the window as Laken tried to find words.</p>
<p>“Was that—a <em>Frost Faerie?</em>”</p>
<p>“You’ve met them?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Hell, I <em>knighted</em> a few of them. But they helped save Durene’s cottage from an avalanche—or caused it and spared her home. I’m not sure of which.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m friends with one. Look, sit down. I’ll explain as much as I can—but the Frost Faeries probably didn’t cause the avalanche. They don’t kill, although they do pull horrible pranks.”</p>
<p>Ryoka and Laken sat down as, below them, they heard confused shouting. Ivolethe’s laughter was drowned out as she buzzed by the inn outside, but Ryoka could just imagine her hurling snow and ice into the building.</p>
<p>“Okay, let me begin from the start. The first thing you need to know is that I got here a few months ago. I’d say around…September? A while back. But Erin arrived before me. We don’t know how we got here, but I know there are other people in this world. I also know that not a lot of people know we exist. That woman I told you about—Lady Magnolia Reinhart. She employs Reynold and a bunch of other servants, and she’s one of the most powerful people on the continent…”</p>
<p>Laken listened intently as Ryoka whispered to him amid the sounds of the inn clearing out. He turned to tell Durene everything was fine when she told him the bottom half of the inn was covered with snow, but he mainly just listened as Ryoka gave him an abridged version of what had happened when she entered this world.</p>
<p>And then it was his turn. Ryoka didn’t just listen—she had her iPhone held in her lap, recording Laken’s every word as he spoke. She didn’t mention this fact, and neither did Laken or Ryoka ever mention certain key words aloud.</p>
<p>Words like [Emperor], gunpowder, iPhone, dragon, or a thousand other words from home. Ryoka was glad that Laken understood, and he picked up what she feared from what Ryoka never said.</p>
<p>“It sounds like you’ve had a rough time without a class. I can’t say I understand that bit.”</p>
<p>“I don’t like conformity.”</p>
<p>“You think that’s an issue—wait. I think I get it. Game system, right? But is there a puppet master?”</p>
<p>“Probably, yes.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really? How do you know?”</p>
<p>Laken sat forwards. Ryoka hesitated, and then leaned forwards as well. Though she knew Reynold and the other spies in the building were probably gone, she whispered to him in German.</p>
<p>“Ein Gott…lebt.”</p>
<p>A slow frown was her only reply. Laken sat back carefully.</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. But I talked with someone who assures me it’s true. And I believe him.”</p>
<p>“In that case—that <em>is</em> concerning. But still, as far as I understand it, the system is essential. You can’t fight a…a monster without Skills.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. But do we lose anything if we have a class?”</p>
<p>Laken’s voice was thoughtful.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. And honestly, I’m not sure I’d be willing to try and find out, if it were me. But if you want to be the test subject…I’m glad. It’s good to have someone who might be impartial. Especially if what you say is true.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if they’re connected, but it seems so.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I agree. But really…alive?”</p>
<p>“Yes. And apparently talking about them gives them strength.”</p>
<p>Laken shivered.</p>
<p>“That’s horrific. Terrifying. But it sounds like this—person—isn’t too active?”</p>
<p>“No. I shouldn’t say lebt. More like…hold on. Schlafen. Aufwachen.”</p>
<p>“<em>Ah.</em>”</p>
<p>It was as if he’d taken a drink of water after being dehydrated. Laken felt everything snap more into place.</p>
<p>“I think I get it. Or at least, I have a hypothesis.”</p>
<p>“So do I. Either way? It’s bad news.”</p>
<p>“But from what you say, it doesn’t seem like that’s the reason we’re here. It’s probably a spell?”</p>
<p>“Someone said that there was a summoning spell. In Rhir.”</p>
<p>“Something to look into. I guess.”</p>
<p>Laken frowned and scrubbed at his hair.</p>
<p>“This is all so <em>complex!</em> How are we supposed to figure this out? It’s not as if we can just ask, and we don’t have people we can trust to find out. I don’t, at any rate. You have your [Lady] friend, but I don’t trust her further than I can throw her either.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m not too keen on asking. But those angry ant people I told you about? Their entire race is scared spitless of this one person.”</p>
<p>Ryoka chewed her lip, feeling the same urgent panic rising in her chest when she thought about—</p>
<p>A God. A real God, sleeping under the earth.</p>
<p>She expected Laken to share at least a bit of her concern. But the blind man refused to panic.</p>
<p>“I get the issue. But they’re on another continent, right? There’s not much we can do right now—except spread the word, I guess, and find someone who can do something.”</p>
<p>“So you’re saying we don’t even think about it?”</p>
<p>It was impossible to glare at a blind man successfully. Laken smiled.</p>
<p>“Look, if we’re talking about this—person as a threat, then all we need is a devil, right? Anyone tried blood summoning, chanting in Latin, or hooded robes? Or we could get a few angry atheists. Who knows? It could work.”</p>
<p>Ryoka stared at Laken and then burst out laughing.</p>
<p>“You cocky bastard.”</p>
<p>He raised his hands, smiling and laughing with her.</p>
<p>“Hey, it’s a problem. But it’s not immediate, is it? If I panicked over all of the big things, I’d never get to sleep at night.”</p>
<p>“Fine. I get it. Back to you, then. You’re in a bind. Assuming no one catches wind of what you do, you’re going to need help for that village of yours.”</p>
<p>Laken nodded. He wove his fingers together and tightened his grip.</p>
<p>“I think we’ve got food and protection, but if you know anything about…anything, I’d love to have some help.”</p>
<p>Ryoka had to confess her knowledge was limited.</p>
<p>“I’ve got some information, but it’s all scattered. Ruling a village—good luck. Other than that, technology’s tricky. I’m not giving you the recipe for…well, firearms.”</p>
<p>“Perish the thought.”</p>
<p>“—And I can’t tell you how to make anything too useful. Steam engines, light bulbs…not exactly stuff your village needs right now.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Ryoka frowned as she tapped a finger on her leg, letting it bounce against the floorboards. Laken found the sound slightly annoying, but he waited patiently for Ryoka to finish thinking.</p>
<p>“Greenhouses might help. If you can get sheets of glass for the roof, you can build the rest of the structure out of other materials. That would extend your growing season—let you get a head start on growing.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“There’s glass in this world. If you can get panes, or one large sheet—could be tricky, could be worth it. I see some parchment over there. I’ll use that, okay?”</p>
<p>“Feel free.”</p>
<p>Laken heard Ryoka rustling about and then her fiddling with the inkpot.</p>
<p>“Let me do a sketch. It’s all about keeping the heat in, more than letting it out—on that note, what about agricultural implements? I’d have to do more thinking, but the heavy plough is a good invention to check on.”</p>
<p>“I’m familiar with a plough—sort of. What’s the heavy one do?”</p>
<p>“It’s really just a way to make it better. You have wheels and…nah, it’s really just the wheels that change it. It lets a farmer move faster, reduces the burden, et cetera. See?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t. But go ahead.”</p>
<p>He heard a chuckle.</p>
<p>“Okay…I’m drawing a diagram, but just ask whether the [Farmers] in your village use wheels on their ploughs. I’ll write down what I know about crop rotation too—”</p>
<p>They continued in that vein for a few more minutes. Then Laken switched the issue over to protection.</p>
<p>“I don’t think a palisade’s going to stop a monster, do you?”</p>
<p>“It’s worth a shot. A wall would be better.”</p>
<p>Ryoka raised her eyebrows as she sketched out the cross section of a wall. Laken had another thought.</p>
<p>“If we’re talking about walls, then what about trebuchets? You wouldn’t happen to know—”</p>
<p>“Hah. If you’re fighting monsters the size of castles, maybe. But they’re a pain in the ass to aim. Just build a catapult; you can probably figure out how. Actually, now that I think of it…a ballista might be easier than an onager.”</p>
<p>“Okay? What’s an onager?”</p>
<p>“That’s a catapult. The classic kind that hurls things like a spoon.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Yes, I could see that being useful.”</p>
<p>“I’ll write down how to make both for you.”</p>
<p>“And that’s not classified? I thought we were trying to reduce the spread of dangerous weapons.”</p>
<p>“I did my research. They’re already in use. The Drakes have them on some of their city walls, and they’re used around the world. The trick is that most people can’t build them. You have to have the [Engineer] class to build one.”</p>
<p>“Ah. No one bothers to learn. They just use a class.”</p>
<p>“Yep. But you can probably whip one together…just be careful with the tension on the rope. Build some prototypes and test them—carefully. Look, I’ll write this down and you can have someone read it. I’m sure your villagers can find some decent rope to use.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure they’ve got something. Okay, how about barns?”</p>
<p>“Barns?”</p>
<p>“Do you have a better way of building them, or something?”</p>
<p>“Good point. I can definitely tell you how to make a log wall…that’s just cutting the logs right. Uh…I don’t know about other building techniques. Let me get back to you on that. Shame there’s no metalworking industry or you could try mass-producing things like ring-shank nails…”</p>
<p>“You’re losing me here.”</p>
<p>Ryoka smiled as she bent over the parchment. She was running out of room. But surprisingly, she was enjoying her conversation with Laken. Did she trust him? A bit. A little bit.</p>
<p>An [Emperor]. She couldn’t imagine it. But he sat like one, or—perhaps the beginnings of one. She saw that now.</p>
<p>Emperor Norton. She remembered that story! The crazy guy who declared himself the Emperor of the United States. People might remember that story, but how many would think to do it here?</p>
<p>Not many. Ryoka had never dreamed of that. And it wasn’t just that. Could anyone really just become an [Emperor] by willing it? No. You had to have something else, or anyone could be an [Emperor], right? You had to have…</p>
<p>“The arrogance of a God.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. What was I saying?”</p>
<p>Ryoka went to dip her quill in the inkpot. She wished she had a pen. As she did, she glanced at the window, still ajar. She wondered when Ivolethe would come back—</p>
<p>And she was there. Ivolethe. She was hovering outside the window, watching Ryoka and Laken talk. Just watching. Ryoka froze, quill dripping blobs of ink.</p>
<p>There was something about the way the Frost Faerie stared at her. Something…</p>
<p>She was watching. Waiting. Ryoka felt a chill.</p>
<p>“Ryoka? Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“I—I don’t know. I think there might be—”</p>
<p>How could she explain it to Laken? Ryoka was grasping at words, when she saw something move in front of her.</p>
<p>It was on the table she’d pulled up to write on. Her iPhone, still recording every word Laken spoke, began to vibrate. It shuddered on the wood surface a microsecond before Ryoka heard the familiar, annoying jangle of her ringtone.</p>
<p><em>Someone was calling her.</em> Ryoka felt her breath catch in her chest.</p>
<p>“Is that—”</p>
<p>Laken reached for the iPhone, but Ryoka was faster. She saw the familiar calling screen, but there was nothing listed under the caller’s phone number, only the option to accept or decline.</p>
<p>“It’s my iPhone. I’m getting a call—”</p>
<p>“From who?”</p>
<p>“It has to be [BlackMage]!”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“The person who—I’m answering it.”</p>
<p>Laken held his breath as Ryoka gingerly tapped the glowing green phone symbol. Instantly, she heard a voice.</p>
<p>“—he’s not answering. Maybe try ag—hello? Hello? Can you hear me?”</p>
<p>Ryoka traded glances with Laken. He missed. Ryoka tilted her iPhone’s speaker towards her mouth cautiously.</p>
<p>“I can hear you. Who is this?”</p>
<p>“Oh my god. Is this—are you [batman]? [batman]’s a <em>girl?</em>”</p>
<p>It was a young man’s voice, excited, with the touches of…an English accent? Yes, it definitely wasn’t American. Ryoka carefully put the call on speaker phone as she and Laken crowded around her device. She put a finger to his lips and he nodded.</p>
<p>“This is great! I’ve tried calling you before and you didn’t pick up. Hi there! This is [BlackMage]! From the chat? Do you remember me? Well, I was calling you to—”</p>
<p>“Fuck you.”</p>
<p>Ryoka heard [BlackMage] pause. She saw Laken glance at her oddly, but she didn’t care. Anxiety had become irritation and anger in a second.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Go fuck yourself. Do you know how <em>stupid</em> it is to call someone like this? What would have happened if I were in a dungeon, or trying to hide from a monster?”</p>
<p>“I—”</p>
<p>“You have <em>compromised</em> my damn phone! You know that asshole was trying to find out locations! Do you think he’s really not trying to track us down right now? I’d bet anything that this kind of call can be traced. Now people know exactly where you and I are.”</p>
<p>“Hold on! We don’t <em>know </em>anyone’s tracking this call. I’m with a bunch of [Mages] and they say—”</p>
<p>“Screw what they say. This is dangerous. Didn’t you get that from your call?”</p>
<p>“That’s <em>why </em>I’m calling you!”</p>
<p>The young man on the other end of the line was getting angry. He spoke quickly before Ryoka could insult him again.</p>
<p>“We—the mages of Wistram and I—are trying to find people across the world! I’ve called a bunch of people and we’re trying to bring them here. To Wistram!”</p>
<p>“That is the <em>stupidest—</em>how do you know you’re not revealing their locations?”</p>
<p>“We—we’re using magic in secret.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Well, that makes me feel better.”</p>
<p>“Look, if you’re going to be an arsehole about this, I can hang up.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s too late now.”</p>
<p>Ryoka tried to calm herself down. She took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Okay, why <em>are</em> you calling? To invite me to Wistram?”</p>
<p>“Yes. We can send help. We can have money sent—or get in touch with a local [Mage] affiliated with us who can help you reach the isle. But I contacted <em>you</em> first because you managed to uncover that fake wanker—[Kent Scott] and warn everyone. Do you know who he is?”</p>
<p>“No. I have no idea. But I was suspicious from the start. Forget [Kent Scott]. How do I know I can trust you, or anyone?”</p>
<p>“I—look, you’re being fairly suspicious of me, don’t you think? I’m calling you—”</p>
<p>“And I don’t <em>trust</em> people who call me out of the blue. How can we prove that these people at Wistram are trustworthy?”</p>
<p>“We can’t.”</p>
<p>Ryoka heard [BlackMage] gasp on the other end of the line. Laken took the iPhone from her and spoke into it. She stared at him, wanting to signal him, but it was impossible to do visually. She tapped his hand with a finger—he waved his hand at her and then gave her a thumbs up.</p>
<p>“Excuse me? Who is this?”</p>
<p>“Call me L. I’m from our world as well. I just met [batman].”</p>
<p>Laken kept his voice low as he spoke into the receiver. He was smiling as if he was <em>enjoying </em>his conversation with the flustered [BlackMage].</p>
<p>“Wow! You’ve met someone else? Where are you? Do you need help? What’s your class—I forgot to mention we’re keeping a list—”</p>
<p>“My class is secret. So is my location. If you can trace this phone call, well, good luck searching the continent. I’m sorry to be so secretive, but neither [batman] nor I are able to trust you, or Wistram at this point in time.”</p>
<p>“<em>Why? </em>Hey, we’re acting in good faith here—”</p>
<p>“Just think about it.”</p>
<p>Laken leaned back on the bed as he spoke carefully, choosing each word with deliberation.</p>
<p>“You say you want to help us. But how can we be sure that’s the case? Putting aside the reputation of Wistram, we can’t tell if you’re calling from there. You could be impersonating them—we have no way to tell. Telling you our location is dangerous, especially on what could be an unsecured call like this. You understand that, right?”</p>
<p>“I—I suppose I do. But how am I supposed to convince you I’m trustworthy?”</p>
<p>“That’s impossible at this moment. There’s no one in Wistram who could convince us, and a truth spell can’t be used. However…there is a way to tell everyone where to go and not reveal confidential information.”</p>
<p>“Really? How?”</p>
<p>Laken could feel Ryoka’s eyes on him, even if he couldn’t see her. He smiled.</p>
<p>“Don’t call anyone. But have Wistram—the Isle of Mages, right? Have them send out a proclamation, a message to every corner of the world. Something simple. Something anyone from our world could understand.”</p>
<p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>Ryoka nodded as she realized what Laken was saying. That could work. She spoke into the receiver.</p>
<p>“Say something like…‘To all the millennials, the Americans and citizens of the European Union and’—no, wait. That’s not right. Instead…send something in every language you can think of. One word. Come home. 家に帰る.”</p>
<p>“Nach Hause zurückkehren.”</p>
<p>“Ven a Casa. In every language you can think of. Understand?”</p>
<p>“I see!”</p>
<p>“But don’t stop there.”</p>
<p>Laken angled the iPhone towards his mouth and spoke urgently.</p>
<p>“Set it up so that anyone affiliated with Wistram will help someone from our world. But have them ask for confirmation. Something only someone from our world would know. Easy things, for every culture.”</p>
<p>“Like if you’re American—who’s the current president? Actually—shit. Be prepared for different answers. Someone might say Obama and not know who the current president is.”</p>
<p>“Good point! And some people might not speak English.”</p>
<p>“Hold on, let me write all this down!”</p>
<p>[BlackMage] was scrambling to keep up. Laken and Ryoka heard other voices, muffled in the background. She nudged him and he squeezed her arm. There were other people listening to the call.</p>
<p>“Okay, we can do that. Thanks for the advice!”</p>
<p>“No problem. Just be sure you know what you’re doing.”</p>
<p>“…How do you mean?”</p>
<p>Laken paused.</p>
<p>“If you do this, you’ll paint a target on your chest for the world to see. Understand—some people who’ve come to this world will not be friends. Just think about it. Assuming everyone who’s arrived is around the same age—you could get anyone from any part of the world. What if you got a radical extremist from ISIS?”</p>
<p>“Or someone from North Korea. Or a kid in a gang, a convicted criminal.”</p>
<p>“…I hadn’t thought of that.”</p>
<p>“Be careful. If everyone’s heading to Wistram, then the real battle becomes getting them there safely…and figuring out who’s trustworthy.”</p>
<p>“We can use spells for that. And Wistram is almost impossible to take by force. There are Golems here, Archmages…”</p>
<p>“If it’s so safe, we’ll find our way there. Eventually. But don’t call us again, understand? If you have to contact us—do it by chat.”</p>
<p>“I understand. And I will…I’ll have to tell the other mages about this, and see what they think.”</p>
<p>“Good. In that case, we’ll end the call.”</p>
<p>“Huh? But there’s so much we have to discuss!”</p>
<p>Laken felt a warning tug on his hand.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, we can’t be sure who’s listening in. Continuing this phone call is too risky. Contact [batman] later if you have to. Try to find a securer means of communicating. Until then.”</p>
<p>“Wai—”</p>
<p>Laken hung up the phone. He handed it to Ryoka and breathed out slowly. His hand was shaking. So was hers as she took it.</p>
<p>“Wow. That was…unexpected.”</p>
<p>Ryoka glanced sideways and saw Ivolethe flying away from the window.</p>
<p>“…Yeah. Good idea, by the way. That was a great thought.”</p>
<p>“It was spur-of-the-moment. But maybe this way word will spread and people won’t get kidnapped. You think it’s a possibility?”</p>
<p>Ryoka shrugged. She wasn’t sure herself.</p>
<p>“There was someone who tried to figure out where we were. Better safe than sorry.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. And one last thing. I didn’t mention it to [BlackMage], but aside from other nations, other factions trying to attack Wistram…if we go there, we’d better have friends. Allies. So we can deal with the mages on equal terms.”</p>
<p>“Can’t trust them, can’t trust anyone, right?”</p>
<p>“Right. Well, some people will be trustworthy, but—”</p>
<p>“How do you find them?”</p>
<p>They sat in silence for a moment, hearts beating. Ryoka looked at Laken and smirked.</p>
<p>“L, huh? Nice reference.”</p>
<p>“What? I’m sorry, did I accidentally do something?”</p>
<p>She paused.</p>
<p>“Never mind. It’s a reference to a popular—it’s fine.”</p>
<p>Laken spread his hands.</p>
<p>“Okay. What now? That was dramatic. And scary. I may have wet the bed. Where do we go from here?”</p>
<p>Ryoka shrugged.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I guess you go back to your village and…do your thing. Gather strength, or something. I go back and tell Erin—and we meet again.”</p>
<p>“Just like that?”</p>
<p>“I guess so. Look, I want to help, but I have to go back. It’s Christmas, and Erin told me to get back in time for the party. And I have…other things to do there as well.”</p>
<p>“Christmas! My God, I’d forgotten!”</p>
<p>Laken slapped a hand to his forehead.</p>
<p>“I should celebrate that with Durene and the villagers! That would be—I wonder if I can get the Merchant’s Guild to find me a bunch of presents?”</p>
<p>“They’d wrap them for you, I bet. Look, I hate to just run, but I don’t know what else I can do. Erin lives so far away, and I never come up here. I can try and return now and then, but it might be we have to communicate by [Message] spell for the moment.”</p>
<p>Laken nodded.</p>
<p>“We can talk in code—or German, I suppose. I’ll probably be out of touch for…I don’t know how long.”</p>
<p>“We have our own places to be, don’t we?”</p>
<p>“It’s odd, but yes. I have a home now. A…”</p>
<p>An empire. Laken didn’t say it out loud. Ryoka stared at him, and wondered. He was likeable, smart, and he cared about people. But he was an [Emperor]. What would come from that?</p>
<p>They didn’t speak much about the future after that. Ryoka drew a bit more on the parchment, and discussed water mills with Laken. He offered her tips on dealing with Frost Faeries, and she convinced him to make Ivolethe an archduchess.</p>
<p>And then for an hour they laughed and talked about home. Laken told Ryoka about what he did for a living—he was ostensibly unemployed since his parents were fairly rich, but he worked with other people with disabilities and led blind tours as well. She told him about Erin and her own backstory. Mainly anecdotes of her run-ins with authority.</p>
<p>“An American rebel, huh? Tell me you ride a motorcycle and I’ll ask for an autograph.”</p>
<p>And then Durene knocked on the door, and Frostwing woke up, and the moment ended. Ryoka stood up, and Laken did too as he tapped his bird on the beak.</p>
<p>“Hush, Frostwing. Say goodbye to Ryoka. She’s got to go.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be in the city until tomorrow, I think. I have to do something quick. Hell, I might not leave until tomorrow night. You can find me at Magnolia Reinhart’s mansion…it might be better if you wait until I come into the city. I’ll find you tomorrow, how about that?”</p>
<p>“Sounds good. Durene? Ryoka’s going to go, but we have a lot to talk about. Can you call Gamel up?”</p>
<p>Ryoka paused next to Laken.</p>
<p>“You’re going to tell her everything?”</p>
<p>“I trust her. And the less secrets there are in this world, the better.”</p>
<p>She hesitated.</p>
<p>“I wish I could be more like you. But I can’t.”</p>
<p>He made a face.</p>
<p>“I think you’re fine the way you are, Miss Ryoka Griffin. Someone needs to be the cynical bastard who watches our backs.”</p>
<p>She laughed.</p>
<p>“I can do that. Good luck. See you later.”</p>
<p>And then she was gone. Laken sat back on his bed, and lay on his back as Durene came back into the room with Gamel. He didn’t look up as Durene sat carefully on the bed and everything tilted towards her.</p>
<p>“Durene?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Laken?”</p>
<p>“Where’s Wistram?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka endured Reynold’s sniffling and very hostile remarks as she walked down the street. The snow was falling thickly around them, but that didn’t muffle his acidic comments.</p>
<p>“Look, I’m sorry. I didn’t know Ivolethe would go that far. But I did warn you.”</p>
<p>“I’m simply doing my job, Miss Ryoka.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, take it up with Magnolia. Or Ressa.”</p>
<p>“I believe I’d rather follow you, Miss.”</p>
<p>“It’s your funeral. Look, it’s one last trip and then we can go home and you can sit in front of a fire.”</p>
<p>“Where to, Miss?”</p>
<p>“Back to Hedault. I have to do something.”</p>
<p>Reynold’s eyebrows rose, but Ryoka didn’t elaborate.</p>
<p>If Hedault was surprised to see Ryoka back so soon, he opened the door readily enough.</p>
<p>“Why have you returned?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to sell you the wand.”</p>
<p>It was refreshing not to have to beat around the bush with him. Ryoka saw Hedault’s eyebrows rise, but the [Enchanter] didn’t miss a beat.</p>
<p>“I can have the gold pieces prepared for you within the hour. I will also provide a second bag of holding as the first will not be able to support the weight—”</p>
<p>“Hold on. I’m not looking for gold. You’re going to pay me something else. Something more.”</p>
<p>Hedault paused. He stared at Ryoka, and then at Reynold, whose jaw was fully open.</p>
<p>“My price is final, and calculated on the wand’s probable value. I will not change it.”</p>
<p>“Don’t give me that.”</p>
<p>Ryoka sighed as she found a seat in the [Enchanter]’s living room and sank into it. He stared at her as she put her feet up. She felt <em>exhausted.</em> Ryoka stared at him.</p>
<p>“Well? Are you going to sit?”</p>
<p>He did, slowly.</p>
<p>“You seem confident that I will agree to whatever you ask.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, that’s because I know what’s inside that wand.”</p>
<p>Hedault paused. Reynold scrambled for a quill and inkpot. The [Enchanter] stared hard at Ryoka, but didn’t call her a liar or scoff. He just asked one question.</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>Ryoka patted her belt pouch.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe? Want to come out? I’m sure Hedault has some snacks for you.”</p>
<p>The Frost Faerie flew out of Ryoka’s belt pouch. Hedault’s eyebrows shot up and Reynold instinctively retreated to one corner of the room as Ivolethe gazed around the room, grinning with her pointed teeth.</p>
<p>Ryoka smiled at Hedault and nodded to Ivolethe.</p>
<p>“You want to know how I know? My friend told me. She’s a Frost Faerie. A Winter Sprite. She can see magic and she’s lived longer than everyone in this city put together. She told me what was put in the wand’s core.”</p>
<p>“I see. A Winter Sprite. Intriguing.”</p>
<p>Hedault glanced towards one of the doors and crooked a finger in his lap. Ryoka blinked as a saucer filled with dried prunes flew over to the table and settled down on it. Ivolethe made a noise of pleasure and began attacking the dried fruit, eating far more than her stomach should have been able to contain.</p>
<p>“If you know the contents of the wand, why offer it to me? Unless the value is lower than my estimation?”</p>
<p>“It’s not. In fact, it’s probably higher. But that’s why you’re going to pay me more. Not just for the wand itself, but for knowing what’s inside.”</p>
<p>“And why should I do that?”</p>
<p>Hedault crossed his arms. Ryoka grinned at that. The mage’s face hadn’t changed, but his folded arms spoke volumes about how much she was getting to him. She gestured expansively at the wand, which Hedault had brought out and put on the coffee table in front of them.</p>
<p>“Just think about it. You’ll never know what was inside, <em>and</em> you’ll have to live with the knowledge that it’s being used by some amateur that won’t appreciate it or utilize the wand’s full potential.”</p>
<p>“I ask again. If it <em>is</em> so valuable, why not give it to the adventurers who recovered it? They would surely desire it most.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure they would. But neither of my friends could use it to its full potential—it’s not specialized in the right area for them. But you could. And if you couldn’t, I’m sure you could find a buyer for it. Correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t this the sort of wand an Archmage would want?”</p>
<p>Hedault’s eyes followed the wand. He spoke softly.</p>
<p>“A true [Archmage] would not. But the Archmages of today would certainly use a wand of this caliber if they had nothing finer. And if it is that valuable, I do not believe I have enough funds on hand to pay for it.”</p>
<p>Ryoka nodded, still smiling.</p>
<p>“I know you can’t pay for it. In fact, after talking with Ivolethe, I <em>know</em> you probably don’t have enough gold on hand to pay for this wand. But that’s fine, because what I need isn’t gold. It’s artifacts.”</p>
<p>She sat up, and put her hands on the table. She picked up the wand and felt its weight. Ryoka stroked the cold, metallic wood as she looked at Hedault. Part of her was screaming not to do this, but the rest of her was resolute.</p>
<p>“Here’s the deal. If I give this wand to you, you give me enough armor and weapons to outfit four adventurers. That means armor for two of them—they’re warriors, at least one more sword, maybe a bow, and two wands and a magical robe for the others. Wands, staves…hell, I’ll take a spellbook as well while I’m at it. <em>And</em> more magical rings. And two hundred gold pieces.”</p>
<p>He stared at her.</p>
<p>“<em>Why? </em>This is not a fair trade. Not for a wand of such value. You may approximate the value with lesser artifacts, but no true adventurer would make such a trade. Why are you doing this on their behalf? If this is an act of self-interest, then I will decline. I will have the answer you have failed to give me. Now.”</p>
<p>His eyes were serious. Ryoka met Hedault’s gaze. She thought he was an honest man. A good man, if he cared about adventurers he’d never met. She nodded abruptly.</p>
<p>“That’s right. It’s not fair. But it’s what my friends need. That’s why you’ll never tell anyone what’s in the wand. It’s why I’ll lie to my friends, though I’m giving them a fortune in artifacts. It’s why I’m selling it. Because this wand is powerful—but it’s not what they <em>need.</em>”</p>
<p>“Explain.”</p>
<p>“Come on. You understand, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Ryoka gestured impatiently to the wand she held. She thought she could sense something inside of it. Power. Pure power, untapped, ready to be used. It was so tempting. That was why she couldn’t bring it back.</p>
<p>“They don’t need a wand that will make them a target of every magic-user on the continent. They need armor, weapons—and money. They need the gear to become a Gold-rank team, not a bullseye on their foreheads. So you’re going to give me everything I ask for, and then you’re going to write down in a book, or somewhere important that you’ll never forget. The Horns of Hammerad. That’s who you owe. And someday, you’ll pay that back.”</p>
<p>For a while she thought he wouldn’t accept. Hedault stood up, paced around the room, and stared at the wand. He went to the racks of armor and weapons, inspected them, shook his head, and stared at the wand. He muttered to himself about gold and costs, trying to talk himself out of it. But he kept staring at the wand.</p>
<p>In the end, he sat with a sigh across from Ryoka and she knew she’d won.</p>
<p>“Say I pay your price. What arms and artifacts would you require?”</p>
<p>She shrugged.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what’s best for an adventuring team that’s about to reach Gold-rank. But I bet you do. And I bet you can get everything I want by tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Hedault stared at Ryoka incredulously.</p>
<p>“And you would trust me to make such decisions?”</p>
<p>“I trust that you would be honest. You seem like you’ve been on a level so far. And I can check all the artifacts you give me, and make sure it sounds like a fair trade.”</p>
<p>Again Hedault went around the room. This time he came to a decision faster.</p>
<p>“One condition. Tell me what is inside. And then I will make my choice.”</p>
<p>Ryoka held her breath. She stared at Hedault, and decided that he wasn’t going to budge. So she judged Ivolethe as the faerie sat on the coffee table, still chewing down the much-depleted plate of fruits.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe? Do you mind doing this?”</p>
<p>The faerie looked up. She stared at Hedault, and then dropped the bit of prune she was eating. She stood up, and flew over to the wand resting on the table. And when she stood above it, she wasn’t the somewhat evil, somewhat playful faerie that lived in Ryoka’s belt pouch.</p>
<p>She was something else. Something older, that stared down at the wand and touched it with a tiny hand. Ivolethe spoke, and her voice was far away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“In a forest long gone, there grew a tree. It grew wild, and tall. And free. Ten thousand winters passed as it touched the sky. So tall. So very high. And when it shed the last leaf upon the ground it grew a single bloom. A child, a small one to grow out of the tree’s final doom. But they took it, they stole it, and sealed it away. Here to never grow, here to always stay. For magic thou art, thou small seedling hid. Magic to summon and wield as your owner bids.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She looked at Hedault, at Ryoka, and Reynold who was staring with wide eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Ye wish to know what lies within? A seed, foolish mortals. A seed of a tree. A child trapped. The power of the earth, of that which stood through wind and storm and fire and axe. Unbreakable. For ten thousand years.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka felt her skin tingle with goose bumps. There was something about the way Ivolethe spoke, about the way she <em>existed</em> that made Ryoka believe every word she said. She stared at the wand and felt her heart ache.</p>
<p><em>Magic.</em></p>
<p>“Living magic. That explains everything.”</p>
<p>Hedault slowly picked up the wand, and stared at it. He ran his hands down the surface of it, and held it as if he thought it would break. Then he looked at Ryoka.</p>
<p>She didn’t need to ask. Ryoka smiled, and stood up.</p>
<p>“I need to go back by tomorrow. Can you have everything ready by then?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It will not be enough, but yes.”</p>
<p>Hedault held the wand and looked at Ivolethe. She stared at it with ancient eyes, and then laughed and flew back to the prunes. He looked at Ryoka.</p>
<p>“I will give you what your friends need. But I will write down the debt, Ryoka Griffin. And when they need to call on it, they need only message me.”</p>
<p>She smiled. It was a tired smile, but sincere. It had been a long day, but Ryoka smiled. Her expression was unguarded, and for once, totally genuine. Both Hedault and Reynold felt a tug at their hearts. For different reasons.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Then she turned and walked out of Hedault’s home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was snowing harder outside. Ryoka stared up at the sky and got a big snowflake in the eye for her trouble. She’d seen worse snow days—</p>
<p>Actually, she wasn’t sure if she had. Ryoka stared ahead and found the snow was falling so thickly that she could barely see ten feet in front of her. Already most of the pedestrians were off of the streets.</p>
<p>“It’s disgusting out here. Let’s go to the mansion!”</p>
<p>For once Reynold was in complete agreement. The two set off at a brisk pace down the street, trying not to slip on the icy pavement.</p>
<p>To Ryoka’s unpleasant surprise, she didn’t get to go back to Magnolia’s mansion with Reynold after that. Instead, she and Reynold were caught by a Street Runner, a Dullahan boy who carried his head on a sling as he ran, as they headed towards the place where he’d parked the carriage.</p>
<p>“Miss Ryoka Griffin? You’re wanted at the Runner’s Guild now. There’s a client to see you!”</p>
<p>“A client? Tell them I’m not interested.”</p>
<p>Ryoka wasn’t in the mood, but the Street Runner was insistent.</p>
<p>“They want to see you <em>now,</em> Miss Ryoka! The [Receptionist] told me to get you or not bother coming back. It’s just six blocks away. We can be there in no time if we run. Unless you’re too slow and old?”</p>
<p>Ryoka glared at the Dullahan boy who turned his head to smile cockily at her. She knew it was bait, but that didn’t stop her from beating him to the Runner’s Guild by a solid ten feet. She flipped him off as she walked inside and saw him grin and race away to his next delivery. She quite liked him, on the whole.</p>
<p>The person waiting in the guild was <em>not </em>who Ryoka expected to see. She stared at Laken.</p>
<p>“I thought I was going to see you tomorrow! What gives?”</p>
<p>“Ah, Ryoka. I’m sorry about this, but it couldn’t wait. Have you seen the weather?”</p>
<p>Ryoka grunted sourly. She had snow all over her shoes and Reynold, wheezing a bit as he came in behind her, was brushing snow out of his hair.</p>
<p>“It’s coming down out there. Why?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s going to be far worse tomorrow, or so I’m told. The snow’s going to cover the roads at least two feet deep—possibly as many as <em>four</em> on top of what’s already fallen if what the [Weather Mages] are saying is true.”</p>
<p>“Fuck. That’s not good. Reynold, how does your carriage handle in deep snow?”</p>
<p>“Fairly well, Miss Ryoka. We should be able to return to Liscor—slowly, but even in deep snow.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s a relief.”</p>
<p>Laken shook his head.</p>
<p>“It may be to you, but Ryoka, the Merchant’s Guild is saying they won’t be able to deliver the food or have the adventurers escort us for at least a week until the roads clear!”</p>
<p>She stared at him.</p>
<p>“Can’t they melt the snow? Hire a mage who knows flame spells?”</p>
<p>“Too costly for me. If I had more money I could, but—no. And we can’t leave right now.”</p>
<p>“So you want to hire a Runner.”</p>
<p>Ryoka nodded. It was the best solution. She glanced at the Runners shivering as they came in from the cold.</p>
<p>“Hire someone good and give them a bag of holding. It’s pricy, but they might be able to beat the snows.”</p>
<p>“It’s a day’s run for the best of them. No City Runner will do it for fear of losing their way, and there’s no Courier I could hire—even if I could afford one.”</p>
<p>Ryoka stared at Laken’s grim face. She got what he was saying and raised her hands.</p>
<p>“Oh no.”</p>
<p>“Ryoka, please. The village will need food soon, and if I’m away for that long they’ll panic. If you can get to them and send a message—”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not—I’d get lost as well! Hold on, I might be able to if Reynold drives me.”</p>
<p>She looked hopefully at Reynold and Laken turned to the [Butler] as well. Reynold hunched his shoulders guiltily.</p>
<p>“I’m terribly sorry Miss Ryoka, but Lady Reinhart did not authorize me to drive you anywhere but Liscor. Under any circumstances. I believe her exact phrase was ‘if she needs to get anywhere, she can run there herself’.”</p>
<p>“Even to help a village?”</p>
<p>“Even then, Miss. You could try contacting her, but I’m afraid that until then, my orders stand.”</p>
<p>“How long would that take?”</p>
<p>As she asked, Ryoka knew that it wasn’t a good option. Lady Magnolia might say yes, but she’d want to know <em>why</em> Ryoka wanted to help Laken so badly. If there was any way to avoid that, Ryoka would.</p>
<p>“If it is not an urgent issue—and I am afraid that Ressa would not consider this such—Lady Reinhart may not receive your communications for a day or two.”</p>
<p>“And I need to be back in Liscor in two days for Christmas. Laken—”</p>
<p>He stood up.</p>
<p>“I know it’s a lot to ask, Ryoka, but you’re the only person who could do it. I can’t afford anyone else, and I don’t want to leave them alone without word for so long. If you could take a bag of holding—the [Receptionists] assure me you could bring enough food for a week or two <em>and</em> some presents with their biggest bags.”</p>
<p>“Presents?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s going to be Christmas soon.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is.”</p>
<p>Laken smiled a bit, but it twisted on his face with anxiety.</p>
<p>“You know, I don’t have a problem staying here. I can buy gifts for Durene and Gamel—after I explain the idea of Christmas to them, of course. But the people in my village need that food <em>now</em>, not after the roads clear. And I’d like to get them presents as well.”</p>
<p>“I know. I know, but—I can’t. I have to get back home and—I couldn’t find my way through a blizzard either.”</p>
<p>The excuses felt hollow in Ryoka’s mouth. She felt a twisting in her gut, but she didn’t see how she could do it. Running was one thing. She could probably run in deep snow—it would be hellish, but she could do it. But getting lost was another issue.</p>
<p>“If it’s just finding your way…”</p>
<p>Laken paused. He frowned, thinking hard.</p>
<p>“Is there a map you could take? Some sort of magical…GPS?”</p>
<p>It sounded ludicrous. Ryoka shook her head as she sat at one of the tables with him. Laken sighed and pushed the small bowl of cheese and crackers someone had given him away. Ryoka felt a rustling at her pouch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Is that food? I claim it!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe leapt onto the table and grabbed a slice of cheese and a cracker. She began munching it down. She was getting gluttonous, Ryoka reflected. She stared down at Ivolethe, annoyed the faerie wasn’t taking things seriously. Then Ryoka paused.</p>
<p>“Hey Laken. Ivolethe’s eating your cheese.”</p>
<p>“I don’t m—”</p>
<p>Laken went silent. He coughed and when he spoke again his voice had taken on a thoughtful tone.</p>
<p>“Christmas is coming up, Ryoka.”</p>
<p>“Yup. Santa Claus.”</p>
<p>“It’s a very famous tradition. I used to hear all the old tales every year. The German stories are different of course, but I’ve heard the American classics as well.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah. All the good ones, I bet.”</p>
<p>“I especially liked Rudolph, although I can’t imagine what the color ‘red’ must look like.”</p>
<p>“It’s not bad.”</p>
<p>“I hate to ask you to run through a blizzard—”</p>
<p>“I’ve done worse. And I’d like to do it. It <em>is</em> the holidays.”</p>
<p>“But the issue is finding your way. Through a blizzard.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’d need a guide. Someone who can find their way. Light the way, rather.”</p>
<p>“I take it the color’s off? I’m told that uh, Winter Sprites are blue. Which is, apparently, not close to red.”</p>
<p>“It’s a bit different. But why don’t I think that will matter?”</p>
<p>Laken and Ryoka kept their voices low. They both felt it. A bit of holiday magic in the air, or perhaps just insanity masquerading as good sense. They turned their faces towards the small Frost Faerie gorging herself on the table.</p>
<p>Ivolethe happily swallowed a large bite of wrinkled prune and then realized she was the target of their scrutiny. Warily, she frowned up at the two Humans staring down at her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“What? What are ye buggers staring at?”</span></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Two days before Christmas, Ryoka stared up at a Frost Faerie and wondered how it had come to this.</p>
<p>“Come on, Ivolethe. Please?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Nae. I won’t do it!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe folded her arms and glared at Ryoka and Laken. The Frost Faerie hovered outside of the Runner’s Guild as Laken and Ryoka stood and argued with her. Durene and Gamel and Reynold were all standing a bit back, watching the young man and woman argue with what was, to them, a fuzzy patch of air.</p>
<p>“I’ll make you the Archduchess of Presents. How about that?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Not if ye made me a <em>Großfürstin</em>! I won’t act like an Ellylldan—like some common <em>pixie! </em>I refuse to guide Ryoka to your worthless little village!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe sneered at Laken and flicked snow at his face. He recoiled as Ryoka tried another tact. They’d been arguing with Ivolethe for fifteen minutes, but the Frost Faerie hadn’t budged.</p>
<p>“Come on, Ivolethe. We need your help. You’re the only one who could navigate through this snow.”</p>
<p>She gestured at the thick, falling snow around them. It was already piling up on the ground, and it made looking down the street a chore. Travelling outside would mean getting lost and freezing to death—for everyone but Ivolethe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Nae. Not even for friendship, Ryoka. My pride will not allow it.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Please, Ivolethe? Think of the children.”</p>
<p>The Frost Faerie paused. It was a low blow, but Ryoka saw it connect and pressed her advantage.</p>
<p>“They’re all by themselves in Laken’s village—probably hungry and cold. Think about that, Ivolethe. If I don’t bring food and supplies to them, they might freeze to death!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I’m thinking. So what?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You’d be doing a good thing. And you’d be a hero. I bet they’ll put up a statue to you, right, Laken?”</p>
<p>She nudged the blind man. He rubbed at his side and nodded.</p>
<p>“Oh, absolutely. I’ll put up a statue to you, Ivolethe. I swear it.”</p>
<p>The faerie wavered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Well…perhaps. But does it have to be <em>red?</em>”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka traded a glance with Laken. He didn’t trade one back.</p>
<p>“It would uh, be easier to see.”</p>
<p>He spread his hands and smiled up towards Ivolethe.</p>
<p>“Red is a very traditional color for Christmas, Ivolethe. And Rudolph’s nose was red. If you changed the color you…erm, you’d be doing the same thing as him. He was a hero, you know. Very famous.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Really?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Frost Faerie swooped down, intrigued. Laken nodded.</p>
<p>“Oh yes. Rudolph is…a, uh, legend where we come from. A folk hero, you could say. Beloved by all. Children everywhere in our world know his story.”</p>
<p>Ryoka held her breath. Ivolethe flew back upwards and muttered to herself. She looked down at Ryoka and sighed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“A statue, ye say?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laken nodded.</p>
<p>“I swear it.”</p>
<p>Ivolethe sighed. She looked down at the two Humans and nodded slowly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">&nbsp;“Well then. What shade must I be? Red of blood? Red of desert sand? Red of setting suns?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka could have cheered. She smiled at Ivolethe and held her hands up towards the faerie.</p>
<p>“Bright red. Crimson, in fact. Like a flare—like this. See?”</p>
<p>Ryoka held up her hands and concentrated. The [Flare] spell burst into life between her hands, a brilliant searing red light that made Gamel and Durene cover their faces. Laken didn’t flinch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I see. Let me try.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe frowned at the brilliant red light and closed her eyes. She gritted her tiny teeth and then the blue aura surrounding her began to shift. The color blue deepened, and then turned purple—then a deep red, and then the same shade of brilliant red as the light in Ryoka’s hand.</p>
<p>“Dead gods!”</p>
<p>“By the Five Families…”</p>
<p>Reynold, Durene, and Gamel reacted as the nimbus of light around Ivolethe changed. The faerie, her body of blue crystal ice now lit by a red glow which turned her entire form light pink, stared at Ryoka with a sour expression on her face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“It is done. Let us be off, Ryoka Griffin. I dislike this immensely, but I will help.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Thank you, Ivolethe.”</p>
<p>The faerie stared at Laken, and then away. The [Emperor] turned to Ryoka as she bent to make sure the laces of her shoes were tied firmly.</p>
<p>“I can’t thank you enough for this.”</p>
<p>“Thank me after I’m done. It’s a long run, but I’ll try to be back tomorrow—or failing that, the day after that. I want to get back and then have Reynold bring me to Liscor. Hopefully I can make it in time for Christmas. If I can’t, well, this is more important.”</p>
<p>Laken reached out and Ryoka offered him a palm to grip.</p>
<p>“You’re a good person, Ryoka Griffin.”</p>
<p>“So you say. Myself, I’m not convinced.”</p>
<p>He grinned and stepped back. Ryoka was doing a second check.</p>
<p>“You have everything you need? Stamina potions?”</p>
<p>“At my belt, courtesy of the Runner’s Guild. Good thing these ones don’t freeze solid. Octavia’s are sort of crap.”</p>
<p>“And you have the second bag of holding?”</p>
<p>“Here as well.”</p>
<p>Ryoka patted the bag hanging at her side. It felt incongruous at her waist—far too light for what she knew it contained. Food for the village, extra blankets, tools they needed—and presents! And yet the bag felt like it only held five pounds of weight.</p>
<p>Magic.</p>
<p>She was ready to go. Ryoka stepped towards Ivolethe.</p>
<p>“Ready?”</p>
<p>The faerie didn’t answer her. Ryoka frowned.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe?”</p>
<p>The Frost Faerie was gazing towards the sky. She uttered an oath—it sounded like it was in Celtic—and sprang up into the air. Ryoka had no idea why—until she saw the other blue shapes flying down towards her. She groaned.</p>
<p>“Oh no.”</p>
<p>Laken turned.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Company. More Frost Faeries.”</p>
<p>“And that’s a bad thing?”</p>
<p>Ryoka didn’t answer. She heard the tiny, crystal voices ringing through the air as the faeries flew down, circling Ivolethe’s lone red glow and laughing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Sister, sister! What is this you do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“She’s changed her color! What rot! What foolishness!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Shut up! I do this for friendship and goodwill! Mock me not, fools!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe roared at her sisters, flying angrily at them as they laughed and flew about her. Ryoka saw the faeries hitting each other and felt a shock—the Frost Faeries played rough! They didn’t just pull at hair—Ivolethe bit one of her sisters in the arm and was mobbed by two of the others in return.</p>
<p>“Hey, stop, <em>stop!</em>”</p>
<p>Ryoka’s voice stilled the fighting above her for a second. Frost Faeries abandoned their squabble for an easier target. They flew around Ryoka, pointing and jeering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Look, the boring one speaks!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“So slow, so uninteresting! But she is with the ruler! Tell us, stupid one. Why is our sister red?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“She’s helping me deliver aid to a village. She’s going to be…a hero.”</p>
<p>The faeries scoffed and laughed, but Ryoka knew them. She raised her hands.</p>
<p>“You may not believe me, but Ivolethe is fulfilling a legend. She’s going to make children happy. You see, there’s a story about a reindeer called Rudolph—”</p>
<p>She got only halfway into her explanation before the faeries swirled around her, laughing with delight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“A guide? What fun! We shall go too!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Yes, let us guide the silly Human!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laken blinked, and Ryoka hesitated. He sidled over to her and whispered as they laughed and flew up and around them.</p>
<p>“They’re not like Ivolethe at all.”</p>
<p>“Some of them aren’t. I think these ones are…younger? Ivolethe’s old, but some of the other faeries seem pretty gung-ho about anything that seems interesting.”</p>
<p>“Is that a good thing or a bad thing?”</p>
<p>Ryoka scowled.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. But it’s better to have them on your side than against you.”</p>
<p>“I agree with that.”</p>
<p>A change in the light above caught Ryoka’s attention. All of the faeries were copying Ivolethe, changing their colors. But they weren’t all turning red. No, some of them were turning green, others blue or purple—in no time at all, a storm of colors flew about in the air.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it.”</p>
<p>Reynold was gaping and Durene and Gamel were staring upwards like children seeing fireworks or stars for the first time. Ryoka stared too.</p>
<p>Faeries, dancing in the night sky in every color imaginable. She felt something stir in her heart, but quashed it. She had a job to do.</p>
<p>She cleared her throat, and the faeries stopped flying about. Ryoka felt some semblance of ceremony was needed here, so she stood straight and pointed west, towards where Riverfarm lay.</p>
<p>“Is everyone ready? We’re going to Riverfarm, Laken’s village. You know the way?”</p>
<p>Ivolethe flew down and the faeries lined up behind her. She scowled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Aye, these fools know. We go, then?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka nodded. She took a breath, and felt just a hint of Christmas spirit in her. Maybe that was what prompted her to say what she did next.</p>
<p>“Alright then. On Ivolethe, on Blue Faerie, on Green Faerie, and Cinnabar Faerie! On Puce Faerie, on Indigo Faerie, on Yellow Faerie and—you know what? Let’s just go.”</p>
<p>The faeries laughed and flew ahead. Ryoka ran after them, cursing as her shoes slipped a bit on the snow.</p>
<p>“Good luck!”</p>
<p>Laken shouted after her. He couldn’t see Ryoka leave, but he heard her footfalls die away quickly in the snow.</p>
<p>“She’s gone, right, Durene?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Laken. Did you see—I mean, those Winter Sprites! I’ve never seen—uh—”</p>
<p>“You’ll have to tell me how amazing it was.”</p>
<p>Laken smiled as he held out a hand and Durene took it. He carefully felt around at the rucksack he was carrying.</p>
<p>“I hope Ryoka gets to Riverfarm all right. But I won’t worry about it. For now, let’s get inside, have something hot to drink, and rest. But before all that—Durene, this is for you.”</p>
<p>“For me?”</p>
<p>The half-Troll blinked as Laken pulled something out of the rucksack. He’d had to buy it when she wasn’t around with Gamel’s help, but the indrawn breath he heard from her was worth it.</p>
<p>“It’s a present. For you. Merry Christmas, Durene. I don’t know what I’d do or where I’d be without you.”</p>
<p>He held out the clumsily-wrapped box, and felt two large hands take it from him.</p>
<p>“I—I don’t know—this is for Christmas, right? But how did you—Laken.”</p>
<p>“It’s for you. Open it.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never gotten a present before. Ever.”</p>
<p>Something constricted in Laken’s chest. He reached out and touched Durene’s hand.</p>
<p>“Well, today you did.”</p>
<p>He smiled. Durene stared down at the small box. Her hands trembled. She began to cry.</p>
<p>In the city of Invrisil, a blind man reached out and hugged a half-Troll girl as the snow began to fall harder outside. At the same time, a young woman ran out of the gates, following a red light that flew ahead of her. A stream of bright lights of every color flew around her, the only clear light in the darkness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“So, the presents will go here. If you’ve got them, put them here.”</p>
<p>Erin was busy in her inn the day before Christmas. She’d made a list, distributed it, and been happily surprised to find that most of her present-givers had already picked appropriate presents for the people she’d assigned them to.</p>
<p>Technically, they weren’t supposed to show her the presents, but Erin had forgotten to mention that presents were <em>wrapped.</em> A quick trip to Krshia solved that, and soon piles of bulky presents were occupying one corner of the inn.</p>
<p>It was a complex system Erin had devised, but in theory it meant that everyone who would be attending her party tomorrow would get two Christmas gifts. Assuming everyone bought presents, that was. Erin was worried she’d forgotten to include someone, but she <em>thought</em> she’d accounted for all who would be present.</p>
<p>And though they had only a day to get last-minute presents, Erin didn’t think that would be an issue. There was Christmas spirit in the air. Everyone she knew, from both Celum and Liscor had heard about the holiday tradition by now. And most were quite eager to try it.</p>
<p>There was just something about giving and receiving gifts that appealed to people. Of course, the receiving mattered to some more than others.</p>
<p>Twice, Erin had to pull Mrsha away from her gift. The Gnoll was sniffing it and wagging her tail, and Erin was sure Mrsha could tell what was inside. But Mrsha was a kid, so excitement was understandable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when it came to people like Relc, it was a bit more objectionable. The Drake had come to the inn early to drink and eat, and he’d stared at the pile of presents avidly. Now he crept about the presents, turning them over and growing increasingly frustrated.</p>
<p>“Hey! Where’s mine?”</p>
<p>Relc pawed through the presents, looking for ones with his name on it. He found none, to his increasing displeasure.</p>
<p>“Your Secret Santa might not have brought it yet. You’ll get two, Relc, so don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Don’t worry—Santa makes sure everyone gets a gift. Good kids, and bad ones. Although, the bad ones just get coal…”</p>
<p>“Right, I forgot. Santa, yeah. Where’s that guy?”</p>
<p>Relc scratched his head. Erin hadn’t talked to him as long as the others. She feared he might have gotten the wrong idea about Santa Claus—in that Relc hadn’t figured out yet that Santa wasn’t real. Still, she had more important things to do.</p>
<p>Some of the Gold-rank adventurers loitering about the inn watched as Erin climbed onto a chair and hung a large sprig in one corner of the room. They weren’t inclined to risk their necks in the dungeon around Christmas, so they had plenty of time to spare.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>Revi wrinkled her nose as Erin nudged the collections of leaves and berries ever so slightly to the right. Erin turned and smiled wickedly.</p>
<p>“Mistletoe! Haven’t you heard about that?”</p>
<p>Sensing something else interesting, more people drew over to look doubtfully up at the somewhat dead leaves and white berries. Erin had been surprised to see they were white. She’d always thought of them as red. But this was the mistletoe Krshia had given her.</p>
<p>“What’s that supposed to do? Are we supposed to jump up and eat those berries? They look poisonous to me.”</p>
<p>Ceria wrinkled her nose as she stared at the berries. Erin laughed and shook her head.</p>
<p>“No! You kiss if you’re under it! Any people who stand under mistletoe <em>have </em>to kiss. It’s a Christmas tradition!”</p>
<p>Not one she’d practiced at home or ever in her world, actually, but Erin thought it was a fun idea.</p>
<p>The change that came over the people standing before was immediate, though. Ceria and Yvlon hurried out of the mistletoe’s radius as if they were on fire. The others stared at each other.</p>
<p>“Well, that sounds like fun! Hey Typhenous!”</p>
<p>The [Mage] was too slow. Jelaqua Ivirith caught him and kissed him on the lips. He shuddered.</p>
<p>“Agh!”</p>
<p>“Sorry. Dead skin and all that. But that’s the tradition. Hey, Seborn, Moore. Want to try?”</p>
<p>The other two Halfseekers shook their head. They’d stayed away from the mistletoe and weren’t approaching.</p>
<p>Halrac and Ulrien stared up at the mistletoe. They stared at each other. Ulrien coughed.</p>
<p>“Um, Miss Erin. Is there any hex or curse that activates if two people <em>don’t</em> kiss under the mistletoe?”</p>
<p>“No. It’s just fun.”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>Halrac stomped quickly out of range. Ulrien followed suit.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t see what the problem is. It’s just a kiss.”</p>
<p>Revi strolled over to the mistletoe, not standing quite beneath it as she looked around challengingly. She smiled mockingly at Typhenous who was taking a drink after being kissed by Jelaqua.</p>
<p>“A kissing game sounds fun. It reminds me of when I was younger. We’d swap mouths and kiss each other at parties.”</p>
<p>She tapped the stitch marks around her lips. Erin paused.</p>
<p>“Wow. Okay. Um, this is really just more of a tradition.”</p>
<p>“Why have a place to kiss if you won’t do it? Who’s good at kissing?”</p>
<p>“I’ll try.”</p>
<p>Pisces stepped forwards, to everyone’s great surprise. Revi looked him up and down, but then she smirked.</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>Erin opened her mouth, raised her hand, and then waved it about, but she couldn’t stop what happened next. Pisces and Revi stepped beneath the mistletoe…and kissed.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long. There weren’t any sucking sounds or visibly tongue-in-cheek moments. But when it was done, Pisces stepped away looking slightly smug. And Revi—</p>
<p>Blushed.</p>
<p>Everyone in the room stared at her. Pisces sauntered back towards the other Horns of Hammerad and winked at Ksmvr. Erin heard the Antinium whispering to Pisces.</p>
<p>“I do not understand what happened. Comrade Pisces, please explain kissing—”</p>
<p>“Had your fun?”</p>
<p>Halrac asked Revi in an acidic tone as she stepped away from the mistletoe. Revi fanned at her face, glancing at Pisces.</p>
<p>“Well, that was surprising. He’s…not bad.”</p>
<p>“Not bad?”</p>
<p>Relc stared at Pisces. He laughed.</p>
<p>“You can’t be good or bad at kissing!”</p>
<p>“That shows what you know.”</p>
<p>Revi stared archly at him. Relc paused.</p>
<p>“Wait, you <em>can</em> be good at kissing?”</p>
<p>Revi, Typhenous, Ulrien, and Seborn nodded. Revi wandered back over to the mistletoe, and this time Jelaqua went with her. Other people from both genders drifted over.</p>
<p>Erin watched with part horror, part fascination. This wasn’t how mistletoe was supposed to be used, surely! But it seemed like there was actual skill at kissing being measured. Some were better than others. And apparently…Pisces was one of the best.</p>
<p>“You know, back home I was told that anyone who could tie a cherry stem into a knot with their tongue was a really good kisser.”</p>
<p>Erin mentioned that as she brought out some dried cherries she’d bought with that very fact in mind. Revi took a break from testing one of the [Actors] from Celum who’d come in for breakfast, and took a stem. She and quite a few people popped the cherries into their mouths and chewed thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Erin glanced around the room as she circulated with ‘testing cherries’. Now that she looked…she had a good distribution of races and genders today. People had come from both Liscor and through the door in Celum. There were Drakes, Gnolls, and a lot of Humans, male and female. She glanced at the mistletoe, where a few red-faced people and more with smiles on their faces were grouped. She had a bad feeling she knew what was coming next.</p>
<p>“Peh!”</p>
<p>Ceria spat out a completely un-knotted cherry stem into the palm of her hand and scowled.</p>
<p>“Not for me.”</p>
<p>“Hrm.”</p>
<p>Revi had bent her stem, but not managed to tie it into a knot. Neither had most of the people in the room. Jelaqua had, but Seborn called foul because she’d done it with her Selphid parts, not her actual tongue. But then Pisces pulled out a cherry stem with a knot tied right in the center.</p>
<p>Everyone stared at him. Jasi came over and stood beneath the mistletoe. She waved a claw at Pisces. She shrugged at Erin as the [Innkeeper] gave her a betrayed look.</p>
<p>“This is so wrong.”</p>
<p>She muttered as she saw Pisces become a target for kisses from the opposite gender. Ceria, standing next to her, shook her head.</p>
<p>“You put the mistletoe up, Erin. What did you think was going to happen?”</p>
<p>“Not this! I mean, why’s Pisces getting all the kisses?”</p>
<p>The half-Elf shrugged, staring at Pisces and not looking at Erin.</p>
<p>“He’s…not bad at kissing. That’s why. It’s fun to kiss him. He certainly got enough practice back in Wistram.”</p>
<p>Erin stared at Ceria. She opened her mouth, and then turned away.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to know! Gah! Mistletoe failure!”</p>
<p>The entertainment for the day continued as Erin served food to her guests. Word spread fast, and within a few hours more people came from both Celum and Liscor—ostensibly to eat and get out of the cold, but mainly to try the kissing game, which was what the mistletoe had become.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relc had lingered hopefully around the mistletoe for quite some time until he realized everyone was avoiding him. He stomped off, grumbling about stupid Humans, half-Elves, String People, and Drakes. He left some coins on his table and left the inn, feeling unhappy and out of sorts. No matter how long he’d waited, no one had brought a gift with his name on it. But Erin had said he’d get a gift! Two!</p>
<p>On the way back towards Liscor, Relc met Klbkch. The Antinium was hurrying up the hill and glancing over his shoulder. He seemed to be worried he’d be spotted.</p>
<p>“Yo, Klb. What’s the hurry?”</p>
<p>“I am attempting to avoid meeting my fellow Antinium from the Hive. If you are asked, you did not see me.”</p>
<p>Relc nodded in an understanding way. He didn’t understand much about Klbkch’s Hive or the relationship the Antinium had with the others—they all looked pretty much the same to Relc—but the Drake did understand not wanting to be spotted by angry people who had business with him.</p>
<p>“There’s no point in going to the inn. Erin’s hung a bunch of mistletoe up.”</p>
<p>“Indeed?”</p>
<p>Klbkch stared at Relc. The Drake nodded grumpily.</p>
<p>“Yup. That means if you stand beneath it, you have to kiss. Only, no one wants to kiss <em>me.</em>”</p>
<p>“Is Erin participating in this ritual?”</p>
<p>“Nope. But I’ve got bad news for you, Klb old buddy. Remember when Erin told us about the Secret Santa thing? With the presents?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I have obtained mine, although I have not placed them in her inn.”</p>
<p>“Well, you might want to hold off for a second. I checked and I didn’t find any presents for me. Not one. And I’m supposed to be getting two! And—get this—I didn’t find any for <em>you</em>, either.”</p>
<p>Klbkch paused.</p>
<p>“That is odd. Perhaps the gifts have not been placed yet.”</p>
<p>“Maybe.”</p>
<p>Relc shrugged moodily. He stared back at the inn, and lowered his voice as he confided in his partner.</p>
<p>“I’m worried we might not get any. Well, I know <em>I’ll</em> get some because everyone loves me. But you might not. Since you’re an Ant. Y’know?”</p>
<p>“This is a distinct possibility. The Secret Santas may object to my identity.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. So…I was thinking, why don’t we do a few good deeds today? I figure, if we show how Christmas-y we are, people will probably get us gifts anyways. Plus, don’t we get more presents if we’re good? That Santa guy brings them, right?”</p>
<p>Klbkch hesitated. He seemed to think as he crossed his arms.</p>
<p>“I did recall Bird mentioning something to that effect. But he was…vague. Is that what Erin said?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Look, you weren’t here, but I heard her telling that thief-girl all about it. Good deeds means you get presents. So why don’t we do some?”</p>
<p>“I take it you have an idea in mind?”</p>
<p>“I might.”</p>
<p>Relc grinned as he rubbed at his chin. His dour mood had been replaced by a fun idea.</p>
<p>“Okay, here’s what I was thinking…I’ll run into the city and buy some stuff. You just need to find me a bag, a red suit, and uh, a beard. Make it white.”</p>
<p>“Very well. Let us proceed with your idea.”</p>
<p>The two [Guardsmen] headed back towards Liscor. That was fortunate for Klbkch, because an irate Antinium with blue shell missed him as she strode towards the inn.</p>
<p>Xrn opened the door and saw Revi step away as Typhenous hopefully tried for a kiss under the mistletoe. The Antinium watched with fascination, her ire with the elusive Klbkch forgotten as she witnessed several kisses…and those who didn’t get to kiss at all.</p>
<p>“Ew! Typhenous, <em>no!</em> Your breath smells horrible!”</p>
<p>The old [Mage] was crestfallen. He eyed Pisces as the younger man went back for round two with Revi. When Pisces was done, Typhenous caught the younger man.</p>
<p>“How is <em>your </em>breath not objectionable, young Pisces?”</p>
<p>Pisces paused. He took something out of a pocket and handed it to Typhenous. The mage stared down at the bit of green in his wrinkled palm. Pisces winked and whispered.</p>
<p>“Mint leaves.”</p>
<p>The old man stared at the leaves and then popped them into his mouth and chewed determinedly. The people who’d heard Pisces immediately left the inn to get some fresheners for their mouths.</p>
<p>Erin threw her hands up in the air.</p>
<p>“It’s not supposed to be a <em>competition!</em>”</p>
<p>She stomped over to the door to Octavia’s shop as Wesle hurried through it. Erin was going to close it, but Octavia called out.</p>
<p>“Erin! <em>Erin!</em> Get in here—I have something to show you!”</p>
<p>Erin paused at the doorway. She looked back at the kissing games, once again featuring Pisces as a main attraction and decided Octavia beat her inn. She walked through the door. What she and the occupied people of the inn didn’t notice was Mrsha, bored with the proceedings, slipping into Octavia’s shop as well.</p>
<p>“What have you got, Octavia?”</p>
<p>“Behold!”</p>
<p>The [Alchemist] was waving a bundle of what looked like twigs to Mrsha in front of Erin’s face. The Gnoll squinted and sniffed quietly as she hid in Octavia’s shop. She knew she wasn’t supposed to be here, but there were so many fascinating smells here! And Octavia had something strange in her hands.</p>
<p>They looked like small sticks, but with a bulb of…well, something strange on the ends. Erin had recognized them, though.</p>
<p>“Matches! No way! That’s it, exactly! Do they work?”</p>
<p>Octavia beamed, nodding and making her dreadlocks swing as she held one up to the light so Erin could see.</p>
<p>“It’s my newest creation. It’s not stable—I could do more with it, but you see, I’ve found a way to blend just a tiny bit of Corusdeer horn with sulfur and—look!”</p>
<p>She swiped the match down the side of the sandpaper box. Erin and Mrsha both gasped as the head of the match suddenly burst into flame. The Gnoll stared avidly at the flame on the end of the stick. How had Octavia <em>done</em> that? She’s simply moved the match…and there was fire! Was it magic? The Gnoll cub desperately wanted to try to do the same.</p>
<p>“You did it! That’s incredible! How’d you do it in one day?”</p>
<p>“Well, when you’re a talented [Alchemist]—I uh, might have made a few dozen prototypes. And stayed up all night. But once I realized how the general idea worked, it just came to me!”</p>
<p>Octavia’s eyes were more than a bit red and she was swaying slightly on her feet. She put the box of matches on her counter as she explained more about how she’d made them to Erin.</p>
<p>Mrsha crept towards the counter. She hesitated—Erin and Octavia were right next to her. But Erin was pointing back towards the open door to her inn and loudly complaining about Pisces kissing all the girls—and them enjoying it!</p>
<p>Octavia looked over, and Mrsha stood up. She snatched the box of matches and scampered away, silent as a moth in the moonlight.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you a box. I can make a lot more—and if I perfect the formula, I’ll be selling them for silver coins!”</p>
<p>“Not bronze?”</p>
<p>“I’m not giving my product away for nothing, Erin! But…let’s just say I’ll be making a bundle if I get this business off the ground. And I have you to thank for it!”</p>
<p>“Cool! How much is my cut?”</p>
<p>The [Alchemist]’s eyes widened. She began to splutter, before she saw Erin’s teasing grin. Still, that was an important point. Octavia took a breath and then she saw the door to her shop open, and a small bundle of white fur scamper out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrsha held one of the new matchsticks up in the cold morning air as she proceeded down the streets of Celum. Quite a few people were staring at her—Gnolls weren’t common at all in this city. Mrsha ignored them, and stopped by a street crossing.</p>
<p>How had Octavia done it? She’d just struck the match—pulled it fast against the side of the sandpaper. Like—</p>
<p>Mrsha slowly grated the matchstick against the sandpaper. It didn’t work. But then she moved her paw faster and the head flared and burst into flame!</p>
<p>Mrsha instantly dropped the matchstick in alarm. It went out as it landed in some snow. She peered at the stick, heart beating fast.</p>
<p><em>Fire! She’d made fire!</em></p>
<p>It was an instinctual thing, for Gnolls to love fire. Like Humans and Drakes, it was that which had helped them separate themselves from the part that was simply wild. It had brought order and light into the night, shown them that they didn’t have to hide in the darkness.</p>
<p>And Mrsha had made it. Without a flint and rocks. Without the need for dry tinder and time. She’d made fire.</p>
<p>And it had gone out. Mrsha rooted around in the snow, and found the matchstick again. She tried to reignite the head, but it was burnt out.</p>
<p>So they only worked once. But that was okay—the box Mrsha had taken had plenty of matches. She drew another, and lit it.</p>
<p>The small flicker of light on the cold winter day was insignificant. Small. It was something that would have passed unnoticed in Erin and Ryoka’s world—well, excluding the present. Any child doing that on a street now would probably cause a bomb scare. But in general, the match was an antiquated, ordinary thing. Who would pay attention to Mrsha and her box of matches in the cold?</p>
<p>Everyone, that’s who. A woman passing on the street stared as Mrsha lit the second match and held it up in the wind. She blinked at the Gnoll. She suspected magic, but the way Mrsha blew out the flame and then lit another match informed her that it was not magic. She stopped and spoke to the Gnoll.</p>
<p>“How did you do that?”</p>
<p>Mrsha looked up in alarm. She understood the woman, but the first thing in her mind was guilt. Did she know Mrsha had taken the box without asking? Mrsha scampered away.</p>
<p>“Hey, wait!”</p>
<p>Mrsha ran back towards the shop. Then she saw who was striding down the street and ran back. Octavia caught sight of Mrsha and shouted.</p>
<p>“There you are! Wait you little minx!”</p>
<p>There was a certain tone adults could use that told children the consequences of not obeying would be far worse than if they did. Mrsha halted reluctantly. She hid the match box behind her as Octavia strode over.</p>
<p>“I saw that! You’re…Mrsha, right? Well, that box belongs to me. You can’t just go around taking things—even if Erin does take care of you! Give it back!”</p>
<p>She held her hand out. Mrsha eyed it and clutched the box tightly. She didn’t want to give it back! The matches were magical in a way that magic wasn’t!</p>
<p>“Come on. They’re mine—you can’t take them! If you want them, you can get them from Erin. Now give…them…here!”</p>
<p>Octavia was engaged in a tug-of-war with Mrsha when the woman who’d seen Mrsha light the match coughed politely.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, are you the creator of those things?”</p>
<p>Then Octavia let go and Mrsha tumbled backwards with the box of matches. She fled a few feet away and turned to watch as Octavia stood and smiled sheepishly at the woman.</p>
<p>“I am, Miss. I’m sorry you had to see that—a bit of reclamation of lost goods, I’m afraid. Don’t worry—they’re not dangerous.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I know. But I was wondering—do you have any more?”</p>
<p>“More?”</p>
<p>Octavia blinked.</p>
<p>“I’d love to buy some of these—flame strikers? I’m no [Mage] and these seem far quicker than flint and steel. What do you charge for a box?”</p>
<p>The woman was already pulling out a purse. Octavia gaped, but then she put her best smile on her face.</p>
<p>“I happen to have a few—they’re very experimental and new, of course. But I think I can quote you an affordable price…”</p>
<p>Mrsha watched, eyes narrowed, as coins changed hands. The woman went away with a box—half filled with matches—and Octavia pocketed a few silver and bronze coins. Mrsha backed away warily as Octavia turned towards her. Only this time Octavia didn’t try to take Mrsha’s matches.</p>
<p>“Well now, <em>that</em> was interesting.”</p>
<p>The [Alchemist] took a few steps towards Mrsha. The Gnoll tensed, ready to run rather than be scolded, but instead the [Alchemist] girl appeared thoughtful. She squatted down next to Mrsha.</p>
<p>“Advertising, hmm? I never wanted to pay for that, but if you consider that child labor is free—why not? It’s worth a shot! Little Miss, would you like a job selling those match sticks for me?”</p>
<p>Mrsha just stared blankly at her. She didn’t quite trust Octavia’s smile, for all the [Alchemist] did it often. She edged away from Octavia.</p>
<p>“Wait—okay, not a job!”</p>
<p>Octavia waved her hands frantically as Mrsha looked down the street. She sighed as the Gnoll stared at her. Then Octavia smiled again.</p>
<p>“I don’t mind you taking the box of matches, Mrsha. I really don’t. In fact, you can have them! Light up all of them if you want! What if I gave you these matches as well—”</p>
<p>Mrsha found a second box of matches pressed into her paw.</p>
<p>“—And you go out there and, uh, show them off? Drum up a little business? I’ll let you sell a few, and you can keep a third—half—okay, fine, you can keep what you earn. But you have to show people where you got them, alright?”</p>
<p>The Gnoll child stared at the second box of matches, and then up at Octavia with narrowed eyes. This wasn’t how getting in trouble was supposed to go, she knew. But Octavia appeared jolly all of a sudden.</p>
<p>“Just bring back people to my shop, okay? Tell them—okay, I’ll tell them. You just come back when you need more matches! I have to make more! A <em>lot </em>more!”</p>
<p>She reached out and shook Mrsha’s paw energetically. Then Octavia went back towards her shop. She turned back and mimed striking another match.</p>
<p>When she was gone, Mrsha scratched her head. She’d understood only a bit of that, but somehow, she now had another box of matches! She thought a bit more, and decided that this was good.</p>
<p>The Gnoll padded back to the intersection and sat down on the paving stones. The men and women of Celum stared at the Gnoll, white and beautiful, sitting in the middle of their city. And they stared as she moved something in her hands and it burst into flame.</p>
<p>Fire. Mrsha struck a match and stared into the small burning torch’s heart. She remembered fire. Fire was important in her tribe’s camp. It was something that gave heat, food, life. It was the center of their existence, in a way. It kept the dark and monsters and fear of the night at bay.</p>
<p>For Mrsha, it was memory. She felt the heat on her claws and flicked the nearly spent match away. Then she lit another one.</p>
<p>People walking down the street stared and pointed at the little Gnoll lighting matches. But Mrsha was far away. She stared into the fire and remembered home. She’d dreamed of tending the fires, of being old enough to manage her own camp site. And now she had the ability to create fires at will.</p>
<p>Another spent match fell into the snow and smoked for a second before extinguishing itself completely. Mrsha sighed.</p>
<p>So brief. So short. But while it lasted…</p>
<p>She lit another one, and the flame burned away a falling snowflake. It lit up part of the world, and a man walking down the street stopped and stared at the match held in Mrsha’s paw.</p>
<p>It was very pretty. And warm. Mrsha just had to be careful, or the stick would burn down and scorch her fur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was Celum, and the small miracle that stopped a street. In Liscor, a different sort of event was happening. It was localized, and went from house to house, usually terrorizing families. They would have called the Watch, but that was sort of the problem.</p>
<p>In the house of the Bitterscale family, the father, mother, and young boy and girl Drakes were sitting down to eat some lovely, fresh Fortress Beaver roast. It was a happy family, untroubled by thoughts of adventurers, Goblin Lords, or the new dungeon for the moment. They were about to eat when someone pounded on the door.</p>
<p>“Who’s that?”</p>
<p>Frowning, Wress Bitterscale went to answer the door. He opened it and found a huge Drake, dressed in an ill-fitting red costume—that was to say, leather armor painted red, with a red hat on his head and a lumpy bag slung over one shoulder.</p>
<p>“Hey! Is everyone here? Good!”</p>
<p>Relc grinned down at Wress. He pulled the door open wider and strode into the house.</p>
<p>“Wress? Who’s there?”</p>
<p>Vessra Bitterscale cried out in alarm as Relc strode into the room. The two children stared up at Relc as he grinned down at them, showing off all his teeth. He dropped the bag he was carrying onto the ground with a <em>thump</em> and waved at the kids.</p>
<p>“Hey there! Merry Christmas! I’m Santa. Santa Claus. Where’s your chimney? Have you been bad or good? I’ve got coal!”</p>
<p>The children backed away from Relc. He frowned as he rummaged around in his sack.</p>
<p>“What? Hold on—some of these are broken. I’ve got to—hey, Klb! Get in here and help spread the cheer!”</p>
<p>He turned and roared towards the doorway. Wress stared in horror as someone else entered the home. The two Bitterscale children stared up with wide eyes as an Antinium, tall and lithe, walked into the room. He had two swords sheathed at his side, and he walked like a soldier. He also had a rough beard made of goat’s hair glued to his face.</p>
<p>Klbkch clicked his mandibles as he stared down at the children. They appeared to be rooted to the spot with terror. As this was how most children acted around him, Klbkch thought he’d made a good impression. He slapped his belly with a <em>crack</em> of chitin on carapace, making all the Drakes flinch.</p>
<p>“Ho. Ho. Ho. Have you been good children this year? If not, you will get the coal.”</p>
<p>The Bitterscale family stared at the two guardsmen. They stared towards the door. But there was nowhere to run. And then Relc pulled out a clumsily wrapped dagger and tried to give it to the daughter.</p>
<p>Point-first. In fairness though, that <em>was</em> an accident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She was…eight hours into her run? Ryoka had no idea, but she was cold, wet…</p>
<p>And not feeling too bad. Ryoka had downed the second stamina potion thirty minutes ago, and that was keeping her going. As she ran through deep snow, following the shimmering lights overhead, she felt the burning energy inside her, giving her legs the strength to run.</p>
<p>The Runners of Invrisil knew how to prepare for long treks. The Guild had not only given Ryoka several stamina potions to allow her to run all night, but they’d given her a healing potion as well. It helped with the chafing, the sore feet, and the occasional falls onto the hard ground. It wasn’t fun running in the middle of a blizzard towards a village, but, Ryoka had to admit, it wasn’t bad.</p>
<p>The Frost Faeries made all the difference. They flew ahead of her, lighting the way. Without them, Ryoka wouldn’t have known where to go. But they led her on, giving her the surety that she was going in the right direction.</p>
<p>The only problem was her speed. Despite her potions, Ryoka still wasn’t moving that quickly in such horrible conditions. Of course, she wasn’t going that slow either.</p>
<p>The snow was ankle-deep in the best of places and getting deeper by the hour but Ryoka had gotten used to running in such conditions. She wouldn’t have called her progress fast, but when she stuck to the relatively shallower roads she made good progress. She might have to run late into the night, but she’d probably get to the village on time, especially with the stamina potions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not everyone saw it that way. The trouble had started five hours into the run. Ryoka had heard grumbling from up ahead, but it had been silenced by Ivolethe. Three hours later, though, she could hear the complaints from the faeries flying around her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Hurry up, slow slug! We don’t have all day!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Yes, run faster! Snail! Worm!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They were getting bored. That was the problem. The other faeries that had joined Ivolethe had quickly lost the spirit of giving and regained the spirit of boredom.</p>
<p>And spitefulness.</p>
<p>Ryoka felt a snowball smack her on the back of the head. She gritted her teeth. She’d forgotten how objectionable most Frost Faeries were. Ivolethe was sweet as candy compared to her sisters.</p>
<p>“I’m moving as fast as I can.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Not fast enough!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Yes, we tire of this! Let’s do something <em>interesting!</em>”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A chorus of voices agreed with the second speaker. Ryoka shook her head.</p>
<p>“If you’re tired, you can leave. I’m going to keep running, though.”</p>
<p>The faeries grumbled, but made no reply. They flew away from Ryoka, letting their lights fade in the flurrying snow. Ryoka prayed they’d left as she continued onwards, following the edge of a pond of some kind. She stared at Ivolethe’s red light ahead, using it as a compass.</p>
<p>It turned left. Ryoka followed it—</p>
<p>And found herself tumbling down a cliff. She shouted in confusion as the ground gave way beneath her and she slip and fell downwards. She hit the ground and lay there stunned for second. Then she found her voice.</p>
<p>“<em>Ivolethe! </em>What the hell was <em>that!?</em>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“It was not me!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The faerie flew towards Ryoka as the girl got up. Ryoka took a step towards Ivolethe, but then she spotted another red light floating towards her. And another. And another—</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Hah! We got her, sisters!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“She fell! Let us do it again!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other faeries, now all glowing the same color as Ivolethe, swooped around Ryoka, crowing with delight. Ryoka swore loudly.</p>
<p>“You have <em>got</em> to be kidding me! Stop that! I need to get to Riverfarm!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Hah! This is far more fun than bringing you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Yes, yes! She wants to go to that stinking village? Let her find the way. Only, which way is the right way? Choose, mortal!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe, or a faerie that might have been her, swooped closer to Ryoka’s face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“This way. Ignore those fools!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another faerie flew past her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“No, you idiot! This way! I’m the real Ivolethe, not that faker!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“No, it’s me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Nae, I!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Ignore all these clods! Run, and do not look back!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suddenly, all the faeries were flying around Ryoka, in every direction. She swore as the red lights spread out around her, each one shouting her name. Ryoka cupped her hands to her mouth.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe! Tell me about my German!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“‘Tis rot! A moose gargling a toad sounds far better!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the faeries ahead of Ryoka shouted that. Ryoka grinned and ran towards it as the other faeries made annoyed noises. Ivolethe led Ryoka onwards, but now the other faeries were flying around Ryoka, getting in her way, spraying her with snow—</p>
<p>And trying to lead her astray. Like the will o’ wisps that Ivolethe had resented being compared to, the faeries tried to confuse themselves with Ivolethe, flying in her path and then breaking away. Ryoka attempted to keep her eyes on Ivolethe, but the faeries constantly mimicked her voice, claiming Ryoka had been led astray.</p>
<p>Soon, Ryoka had no idea if she was following the right Ivolethe again. She shouted, got a response, and set off once more. But again the faeries made her progress grind to a halt.</p>
<p>“Fuck you!”</p>
<p>She shouted up at the glowing red lights flying in every direction. The faeries laughed mockingly. Ryoka felt despair and fury building in her chest. She couldn’t get lost out here! But there was no way to get rid of the faeries! And she couldn’t tell them apart!</p>
<p>As Ryoka stumbled onwards through a forest with faeries shouting and flying in every direction, she heard and felt the earth <em>rumble.</em> The Runner turned and saw something huge moving to the left. The ground itself heaved upwards as faeries cried out in alarm and scattered.</p>
<p>“What in the name of crap is <em>that!?</em>”</p>
<p>Ryoka sprinted away as the snow erupted and something swiped at the faeries who had been shouting so loudly a second ago. They flew away as Ryoka saw the thing heave itself up even higher.</p>
<p>Higher. And higher. It rose, a colossus, out of the ground. No—it wasn’t <em>out</em> of the ground. Ryoka realized to her horror that it had been the ground itself! It had been slumbering, until her noisy passage had woken it. But now it rose, and turned towards her. She saw it.</p>
<p>A giant face. A wall of ice. Broken shards. Melted snow. Two massive eyes formed of rock. And then the mouth opened. The Frost Golem <em>roared</em>, its voice the sound of crashing snow and grinding stone.</p>
<p>The faeries screamed back. A flurry of red lights flew up and dove at the Frost Golem’s face, striking it with ice and wind, castigating the massive creature for interrupting their fun.</p>
<p>The ice was probably no harm at all to the Golem, but it disliked the attacks. It swiped at the faeries, and they flew away, jeering at it as they effortlessly dodged the large creature. But they had been distracted, and the Golem began to chase after them, roaring in a voice that shook the entire forest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Quickly, Ryoka! While they are distracted!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A single red light flew down. Ryoka saw Ivolethe beckoning her onwards. Ryoka took one look at the Snow Golem and froze. It was chasing the Frost Faeries away, giving them a far larger target to harass. But that wasn’t what made her eyes go wide and her knees suddenly weak.</p>
<p>“No way.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“What is it, Ryoka?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe stared at Ryoka’s pale face. The girl swallowed hard.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it. I can’t. It’s not possible.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“What, what?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe peered at the Snow Golem, but couldn’t see anything odd about it. She urged Ryoka onwards as the Golem thundered away from them, making the ground shake. Ryoka ran on, turning her head to watch the Snow Golem.</p>
<p>It was impossible. And yet—Ryoka saw it so clearly as she broke out of the forest, following Ivolethe. The Snow Golem was a distant shape in the distance, already nearly obscured by the blizzard.</p>
<p>It was just a Snow Golem, a natural phenomenon in this world. It didn’t look like a classic snowman at all; it was a mountain of ice rather than three spheres stuck together. And yet—</p>
<p>It had a hat.</p>
<p>The black mass on its head was too much like a top hat for Ryoka to call it anything else. Her brain knew it was probably some trees or boulders sticking out at odd angles. That, combined with the darkness made it <em>look </em>like a hat. That was all.</p>
<p>But still, she saw it. The Snow Golem wore a hat on its head as it roared and chased the other faeries away. Ryoka stared after it, and then began to hum under her breath. She turned and called out to the hovering faerie glowing crimson.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe? Let’s go.”</p>
<p>The faerie led her onwards. Ryoka pumped her legs, put her force into her stride. She ran onwards, bringing gifts and relief for a village that needed it. But her head turned one last time as she ran. She spoke under her breath.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Frosty.”</p>
<p>A distant roar was her only response. Ryoka smiled, and kept running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few hours after Mrsha had lit her first matchstick, she lit the one hundred and twenty third and watched the flame slowly eat away the stick. She held it close to her face and felt the heat warm her paw. Then she looked up and around Octavia’s shop. It was getting quite noisy.</p>
<p>“I’ll take five boxes!”</p>
<p>“Six, here! I’ll pay with silver!”</p>
<p>“A gold coin if you show me how to make them! Five!”</p>
<p>People were quite agitated about the matchsticks Mrsha was having so much fun lighting. Mrsha understood and didn’t understand at the same time. To her matches were fun, enjoyable, and magical. To the people who’d followed her off the streets and into Octavia’s shop, they were something more.</p>
<p>They were crowded around Octavia’s shop, Humans, Drakes, and Gnolls alike. Adults shouted for the [Alchemist]’s attention, demanded to know if this was her invention—if she would sell them the matches for the same price Mrsha had. Octavia was under siege at her counter. Mrsha saw her desperately waving one of her arms over her head with the other to get people’s attention, but it was no use.</p>
<p>There were so many bodies in the shop that the door was stuck open, letting the cold snow blow into the building. Snowflakes whirled around Mrsha. One struck her match and put it out.</p>
<p>Mrsha let the spent match drop to the ground and looked around. So many people. So many burnt matches. They were small things, but important. New. Bright.</p>
<p>Then Mrsha sneezed. It was cold, even for her. She peered at the last burnt matchstick and decided she was going home.</p>
<p>The Gnoll padded between the legs of the adults and opened the door back to Erin’s inn. She walked through, and carefully closed the door behind her.</p>
<p>“Mrsha! Where have you <em>been?</em>”</p>
<p>A voice made Mrsha spin guiltily. Lyonette strode over to her, all worry and loving concern.</p>
<p>“I’ve been looking for you all day! You’re freezing! Did you go outside? I told you to tell me when you do that!”</p>
<p>She ushered Mrsha out of the way of a Gnoll and Drake couple who were kissing at each other.</p>
<p>“Into the kitchen. I have something to show you—oh, rats! Wait here. I’ve got to clean up a spill.”</p>
<p>Mrsha obediently padded into the kitchen. There she relaxed as the snow on her fur began to melt. Something dug into her side as Mrsha stretched—she pulled out a small pouch, her pouch, filled to the brim.</p>
<p>Mrsha sat and emptied the bulging money pouch onto the ground. Coins <em>clinked</em> as they fell onto the ground. People had given Mrsha a lot of coins for her matches. And Octavia kept giving her more matches, so things had just sort of piled up.</p>
<p>A small mound of wet coins lay on the clean kitchen floor. Mrsha sniffed at the coins. They smelled like metal and sweat and dirt. She carefully picked them all up and stood up. Clumsily, she walked on two legs to the small pottery jar that Lyonette had put on the counter in the corner of the kitchen.</p>
<p>It took Mrsha two tries to jump and pull herself up onto the counter. But then she was right next to the jar. Mrsha opened the lid and carefully dropped the coins into the jar. They made a lovely <em>tinkling</em> sound as they fell. Then she put the lid back in place.</p>
<p>“Mrsha!”</p>
<p>The Gnoll child jumped. Before she could move, two hands lifted her away from the jar. Lyonette scolded her as she lifted Mrsha up.</p>
<p>“You know you can’t take money from the jar! Do you want some coins? I can give you a few bronze ones—but no taking without asking, alright?”</p>
<p>Mrsha squirmed in Lyonette’s arms. The girl sighed.</p>
<p>“Oh, you! Here. Sit there for one more second, and I’ll give you a treat, alright?”</p>
<p>Lyonette went over to one of the ovens and pulled something out. Mrsha’s nose made her sit up and her stomach rumbled as she saw a huge pan of golden bread appear from out of the oven.</p>
<p>“What do you think of this?”</p>
<p>Lyonette gleefully turned and showed it to Mrsha. She picked up a stick of butter that had been chilled next to the window and began to rub it over the top of the fresh bread as she explained.</p>
<p>“Erin has some—what did she call it? Baking powder, that’s right! It makes the bread puff up like this! She made some and it smells delicious, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Mrsha did think. She licked her lips and stared avidly at the freshly baked bread. The stick of cold butter that Lyonette had rubbed all over the tops had made the bread glisten. Mrsha had never seen bread so <em>plump</em> and full.</p>
<p>She greedily reached for one roll, but Lyonette smacked Mrsha’s paw. The Gnoll gave her an injured look, but Lyonette was unmoved.</p>
<p>“You can have some with everyone else. Come on, let’s bring this out. You can carry a pitcher of m—actually, why don’t you take the butter? Don’t trip!”</p>
<p>Obediently, Mrsha took a saucer of warm, soft butter out into the kitchen. Her stomach was rumbling, and she could already almost taste the wonderful bread in her mouth. She smiled as she walked unsteadily out of the kitchen and put the butter on a table. She had already forgotten about Octavia and her latest invention.</p>
<p>Mrsha liked matches, but she liked being here a lot better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Bread’s ready! Oh—for crying out loud!”</p>
<p>Erin turned from the freshly-cut pieces of steaming bread coated liberally with butter and nearly ran into a couple smooching hard under the mistletoe.</p>
<p>“Oops.”</p>
<p>Selys and a Gnoll that Erin didn’t know jumped apart from under the mistletoe. The Gnoll was blushing—he was a bit younger than Erin, and clearly embarrassed to have been caught out. Selys grinned and waved at the scowling innkeeper.</p>
<p>“Hi, Erin. I uh, heard about the mistletoe. I thought I’d give it a whirl.”</p>
<p>“You and everyone else! I’m sick of it!”</p>
<p>“Aw, come on. It’s fun!”</p>
<p>So said Revi, although her lips were a bit puffy from repeated mouth-to-mouth contact. Erin sighed. She beckoned Selys over and whispered to her.</p>
<p>“Kissing is fine. Just don’t kiss Pisces, no matter if he offers, alright? He’s getting a fat head because he thinks he’s such a good kisser!”</p>
<p>Selys’ eyebrows rose as she glanced over. Pisces was looking more smug than ever as he sat at a table with Ksmvr. Ceria and Yvlon were sitting at another table, ignoring him.</p>
<p>“He’s good?”</p>
<p>“So I’m told.”</p>
<p>Erin made a face as Selys eyed Pisces. She looked around and found a few cherries on a tray.</p>
<p>“It’s become a huge thing. People come in, kiss each other, and try to tie knots with cherries. I’m making money, but I feel bad doing it!”</p>
<p>“What’s so special about cherries?”</p>
<p>Erin explained about tying knots in the stems. Selys looked intrigued.</p>
<p>“That sounds like fun! Give me one.”</p>
<p>She chewed the cherry thoughtfully as Erin sighed and began to offer bread to her hungry hordes of customers.</p>
<p>“You look tired. Why haven’t you gotten a few kisses? It’s fun!”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to. Especially not with Pisces.”</p>
<p>Erin frowned at Selys. The Drake shrugged. She took the cherry stem out of her mouth and handed it to Erin. The [Innkeeper] took it automatically.</p>
<p>“Suit yourself. But—and I’m sorry about this, Erin—I’ve got to see what the best kisser’s like. Hey, Pisces! Come over here, you!”</p>
<p>The [Necromancer] looked up as Selys waved to him under the mistletoe. He smirked and came over. Erin shook her head.</p>
<p>She turned away, and then remembered Selys had given her the cherry stem. She glanced down at it. The girl blinked as she saw the cherry stem, tied into a double-knot.</p>
<p>She looked up as she heard the laughter and a cheer. Selys sauntered away from Pisces to a round of applause from the room. Erin had apparently missed the kiss of the day, and it must have been some kiss, because Pisces was bright red.</p>
<p>He turned away from Selys as she laughed and pulled at another Drake, giving him a quick kiss. Erin stared at Pisces, at Selys, and then laughed.</p>
<p>“Hah! Take that!”</p>
<p>Then someone kissed <em>her.</em> Erin felt the brush of whiskers and a wet smooch on her cheek. She yelped, and looked around. A white, furry face stared at her. Mrsha, perched on the table, held a bit of mistletoe with one claw. The girl stared at her. Mrsha licked her cheek. Erin laughed, and then reached out and kissed the Gnoll on her furry cheek.</p>
<p>“Oh, you.”</p>
<p>Five minutes later. Halrac was sitting by himself, sipping from his drink and not-quite-scowling around the room. For him, it was as good as a smile. He must have been drunk, or just off-guard, because he only reacted when he felt the wet kiss on his cheek. And then, simultaneously, another one on the other side.</p>
<p>“What the—”</p>
<p>Halrac turned, a hand on the dagger at his belt. He saw two large, brown eyes. Mrsha licked Halrac’s stubbly cheek. The [Scout] stared at her, and then turned his head towards the other mysterious kisser.</p>
<p>“Merry Christmas, you grumpy old man!”</p>
<p>Revi grinned at Halrac as she held a sprig of mistletoe over his head. Halrac stared at her, and then at Mrsha, who was sniffing at his drink. He rubbed his cheek and grunted. Revi laughed and spun away. Mrsha leapt from the table and went to get more bread.</p>
<p>Now that the kissing was mobile, everyone was fair game. The mistletoe changed hands quite a few times and left the inn in the pockets of some of the guests. Eventually Erin called for a ban on kissing—if only so that she could serve everyone hot bread.</p>
<p>Halrac sat at the table in the corner by himself, chewing the hot bread and remembering eating something similar back when he was young—although he’d had warm milk back then. He stared around the busy room, at friends and people he hardly knew, having fun and celebrating. The [Scout]’s face didn’t change as Ulrien called him to come over and throw a hand of dice. He waved in denial and sat by himself. Alone.</p>
<p>When he was quite sure no one was looking, the [Scout] smiled. Just for a moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relc and Klbkch sat in an alleyway, staring blankly at the brick wall ahead of them. Neither Drake nor Antinium said much.</p>
<p>Relc was holding the bag of banged-up presents in his claws. It was still full. Klbkch’s beard was slipping off his face again. The glue had ripped free from his chitin.</p>
<p>“What are we doing wrong here, Klb?”</p>
<p>“I do not know, Relc.”</p>
<p>“We’re trying to be like Santa, right? I mean, I’m dressing up like him and everything! Why are people kicking us out? They don’t want our presents!”</p>
<p>“It is a quandary. I believe our efforts, while well-intentioned, have the opposite effect.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Wanna give up?”</p>
<p>“That may be best. Let us retire to Erin’s inn.”</p>
<p>Klbkch and Relc got up slowly and walked out of the alleyway. They walked down the street, ignoring the curious and horrified looks with their heads down. They only looked up when they heard the crying.</p>
<p>Someone was upset. Someone was weeping. And there was the sound of breaking pottery—from one of the houses ahead of them. Relc nudged Klbkch.</p>
<p>“They sound upset, don’t they, Klb?”</p>
<p>The Antinium stared at the house’s door. It seemed…unhinged, as if it had been knocked off its frame.</p>
<p>“Indeed they do. Should we investigate?”</p>
<p>Relc nodded.</p>
<p>“One last time. Then we’re done.”</p>
<p>The two [Guardsmen] approached the door cautiously. Relc nodded to Klbkch as the Antinium took a position on the other side of the door. The Drake counted to three, and then kicked the door in. The <em>crash</em> made everyone inside go silent for a moment.</p>
<p>“Does anyone want a pres—hey!”</p>
<p>Relc’s eyes narrowed as he caught sight of the two Drakes wearing masks over their faces. One was standing guard over two frightened Gnoll children as the other ransacked the house.</p>
<p>The burglars froze at the sight of Relc and Klbkch. Oddly dressed though they might be, the Senior Guardsmen were a known duo in Liscor.</p>
<p>“Well, well, well. It looks like Santa’s found someone who’s been naughty.”</p>
<p>Relc grinned and cracked his knuckles as the two thieves backed up. One whipped a knife from his belt out and stabbed at Relc. The Drake caught the blade barehanded and threw it away.</p>
<p>“Not sharp enough! Hi, nice to meet you! I’m Relc—I mean, Santa Claus! Here’s my fist!”</p>
<p>He clocked the first thief in the face and then kicked him between the legs. The Drake folded up and Relc dodged back as the other one swung at him. He turned, twisted—his tail smacked the second thief in the face with a <em>crack.</em></p>
<p>“You’ve been extra naughty! You’re on my <em>list!</em> You got that, you punks?”</p>
<p>The fight carried out into the street as Relc <em>threw</em> one of the [Thieves] out of the window. The Drake landed with pieces of the broken shutters raining around him. He gasped for air and tried to get up—just in time to meet a black rock that smashed into the side of his face.</p>
<p>“Have some <em>coal!</em>”</p>
<p>Relc smacked the painted black rock into the offending [Thief]’s head. Klbkch tripped up the other as the Drake [Thief] tried to race out of the building. The Antinium calmly strode over to the fallen burglar and kicked him in the stomach.</p>
<p>“Ho. Ho. Ho. Merry Christmas.”</p>
<p>The commotion attracted a crowd. Drakes, Gnolls, and some Humans watched as Relc and Klbkch beat the two burglars down, Klbkch with a brick, Relc with his sack of presents.</p>
<p>When they were done, the two [Guardsmen] straightened up, and heard the cheering. They saw the crowd applauding them, and realized everyone had a huge smile on their face. Relc turned to Klbkch. The Antinium was blinking down at one of the Gnoll children, who’d given him a hug.</p>
<p>“It’s the holidays, Klbkch.”</p>
<p>“Indeed it is.”</p>
<p>“I think I feel the Chirstmas spirit! Look at all these smiling faces!”</p>
<p>Relc grinned as the father of the Gnolls came over to thank him personally. He reached into his sack and rummaged around. After a moment, Relc handed a battered present with a bit of blood splattered on the side to one of the Gnoll children. The young Gnoll sniffed curiously at the package, and then tore apart the wrapping. He stared at the wooden buckler and sword and grinned in delight.</p>
<p>Klbkch slapped Relc on the back. Relc staggered, and glared at him.</p>
<p>“<em>Ow.</em>”</p>
<p>“I am expressing my enthusiasm as you often do.”</p>
<p>“Don’t. That’s my thing.”</p>
<p>Relc sighed. He cracked his knuckles and stared around at the other children, who were already fighting over the presents Klbkch was handing out.</p>
<p>“That was fun. Alright. I’m done. Let’s get a drink, shall we?”</p>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>
<p>They left the bag of presents and fake beard and Santa costumes to be claimed by the excited children and pedestrians. Klbkch and Relc marched the battered [Thieves] to the city jail, talking along the way.</p>
<p>“Do you think that was enough good deeds?”</p>
<p>“I believe so. As we both regularly perform acts in service to the city, we should have accumulated an excess of good deeds this year.”</p>
<p>“Awesome. I wonder what I’ll get from the real Santa-guy. He’ll deliver the presents to Erin’s inn, right?”</p>
<p>“I would like a Dwarf-crafted sword.”</p>
<p>“Ooh, do you think I could get an enchanted spear? I left my old one back with the army.”</p>
<p>“We should ask Erin if Santa has any [Blacksmith] levels.”</p>
<p>“He’s gotta. I mean…presents, right? You can’t just make do with [Craftsman] levels.”</p>
<p>Klbkch was silent. He paused as he thought more concretely about Santa, and the odds of receiving a specialty-made item manufactured across the continent. For the first time, Klbkch questioned Bird’s scattered account of a Human man who rode a sleigh pulled by reindeer that flew.</p>
<p>“…It occurs to me Relc, that this Santa Claus that Erin has spoken of does not exist. The presents may in fact come from other people and are simply attributed to his presence.”</p>
<p>Relc paused. His tail drooped as he suddenly put some obvious pieces together.</p>
<p>“No. You think so?”</p>
<p>“If Santa existed, why has he not given us presents before?”</p>
<p>“Aw…no! I thought maybe it was a Human thing and we were included on his list since Erin knows us!”</p>
<p>Klbkch brightened up.</p>
<p>“That may be true. I did not consider that. Let us ask Erin whether that is the case.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, both Drake and Antinium found to their disappointment that Santa was a myth. Erin laughed herself off of her chair when she heard what they’d done. But she gave them a hug and hot food, and so the [Guardsmen] felt a bit better by the time the inn closed.</p>
<p>“I guess we’ll get our presents tomorrow. I mean, if anyone’s left any. Doesn’t look like it.”</p>
<p>Relc sighed as he double-checked all of the presents. There were none for him. He sagged, and then turned, pulling something out of the rucksack on his back.</p>
<p>“Hey Klb, I’m ready to go! Klb?”</p>
<p>The Antinium turned. He had something in his hands. A carefully wrapped present, tied with a string of twine. Relc stared at it, and then remembered Klbkch hadn’t brought his presents yet. He stared at the nametag, and saw his name on the tag.</p>
<p>Klbkch looked at Relc. The Drake had a clumsily-wrapped present in his claws, the wrapping already torn a bit. But Klbkch’s name was clearly scrawled on the nametag.</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>The two [Guardsmen] stared at each other. Then Relc laughed, and Klbkch opened his mandibles in a smile. They put their gifts together and walked out the door, side by side.</p>
<p>“Merry Christmas, Relc.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Merry Christmas, Klb.”</p>
<p>The two sauntered down the hill towards Liscor, talking and chuckling over the events of the day. After a while, Relc frowned and stared back towards the inn.</p>
<p>“You didn’t get me anything creepy or wriggly, did you, Klb?”</p>
<p>“No. Did you get me coal, Relc?”</p>
<p>“No! You’ll like it. I think. Yeah. Probably.”</p>
<p>Klbkch nodded.</p>
<p>“Well then. I shall see you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’ll open your crappy gift during the party. At least I know I’ll have one, even if it is icky.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. One is better than none. I shall contain my disappointment.”</p>
<p>“You do that. Later.”</p>
<p>The two parted ways without a second word. They didn’t look back, but both walked with heads held high.</p>
<p>They were smiling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Late at night, the night before Christmas, hundreds of miles away, the villagers of Riverfarm were about to go to sleep on another miserable, ordinary day that was their life now. But the people who’d been posted sentry raised the alarm, shouting, as they saw something approaching their village in the dark flurrying snow.</p>
<p>“Who—who are you? I warn you, we’ve nothing to take! We’re under the protection of [Emperor] Laken! Begone if you mean trouble!”</p>
<p>Farmer Prost shouted as the dark shape ran towards him. He held a sword at the ready with two shaking hands. He’d never had to actually use it to fight; it was a memento from his father. He was about to swing when he saw the red light illuminating the distinct Runner’s Seal held in a gloved hand over Ryoka’s head.</p>
<p>She slowed as she approached the ruined village, taking in the destroyed buildings, the men and women holding weapons, and the frightened children. The villagers of Riverfarm stared as the strange figure pulled away a scarf and hood to reveal a young woman’s face. They hadn’t seen a Runner come all the way to their village in <em>years. </em>Most messages made the final journey via cart or wagon when they went to town.</p>
<p>“I’m a Runner. I’ve got a delivery from Laken.”</p>
<p>Ryoka had to speak several times to make her voice work. She had to say it again for Prost, who was staring at her uncomprehendingly.</p>
<p>“From—you mean from [Emperor] Laken?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>Ryoka groaned as she took the bag of holding from her belt. She felt like she was dead. Even with the stamina potions and healing potion, her feet ached, her body felt like it was falling apart, and she was numb. But she was here.</p>
<p>The villagers ushered her into their main living space, the renovated barn, and Ryoka sighed as she saw a fire had been carefully built in the center. She trudged over to it, and tried to set herself on fire to warm up.</p>
<p>“We haven’t had word since he left. We were sure he’d be kept by the storm—but he sent you to tell us he’s alright? Has he bought provisions?”</p>
<p>Prost hovered anxiously by Ryoka. She shook her head.</p>
<p>“No. He sent me to <em>bring</em> you them. Here.”</p>
<p>She handed the bag of holding to Prost. His face fell as he saw it, but then it changed the instant he reached inside. Ryoka, staring at the fire, heard the exclamations but didn’t bother to turn around. She wanted to eat the coals and let them warm her from the inside.</p>
<p>“Food! Dead Gods, there’s so <em>much</em> of it!”</p>
<p>“We’re saved! Praise [Emperor] Laken!”</p>
<p>Ryoka heard the commotion and the weeping. It was a while before she could tear herself away from the fire. But when she did, she saw…people. That was all.</p>
<p>She saw people. Just people, ragged, afraid. There was nothing special about them; they were just a frightened mass, suddenly relieved because good fortune had come their way. That was what Ryoka told herself.</p>
<p>They believed in an [Emperor], a false leader. Laken wasn’t—they’d put their faith in him blindly, and he’d delivered. But even so—</p>
<p>The man who’d talked to her, Prost, was in tears. He was hugging his wife and what looked like his daughter, tears streaming down his cheeks. Ryoka couldn’t face the raw emotion, the pure relief in his eyes. She looked away and clutched at her heart.</p>
<p>It wasn’t growing three sizes. It just hurt. She’d run hard, that was all. That was all.</p>
<p>They came to her after that, full of gratitude and heartfelt thanks. Ryoka backed away from it all. She didn’t want praise. She’d just—was just a Runner—</p>
<p>There was something in the air. That was it. Ryoka certainly wasn’t moved by a hug from a tearful mother, or a man taking her hand and bowing to her over and over, praising her for braving the storm. It was just a temporary bit of insanity that made her take the bag of holding she owned, the one with the presents Laken had bought, and walk over to the children.</p>
<p>“Hello there. Have you all been good boys and girls?”</p>
<p>They stared up at her, wide-eyed. Ryoka crouched down as she tried to explain why she was here.</p>
<p>“I’ve got presents, you see. As well as food. Laken—your [Emperor] wanted to make sure you had something nice for the holidays.”</p>
<p>“What holidays, Miss?”</p>
<p>“Christmas. You see, it’s a special day where Laken comes from. On that day, everyone who’s been good gets presents. Who’s been good? I have a present for all of you! For you and you and you…they’re from Santa Claus!”</p>
<p>“Who’s that?”</p>
<p>One of the children asked the question, staring warily at the wrapped gift Ryoka handed him. She smiled.</p>
<p>“Haven’t you heard of the story of Saint Nicholas? Father Christmas? Kris Kringle? Really? Well, he has many names, but I always knew of him as Santa Claus. You see, where I come from, each year Santa Claus gets on his magical sled pulled by flying reindeer and flies around. He flies to every village, every home, every family in every city. And he gives presents to the good kids and coal to the bad ones. He hired me to deliver these presents this year.”</p>
<p>She winked at the adults. They caught on quickly, and smiled and shed some more tears. The children gathered around Ryoka, asking questions.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t he come last year?”</p>
<p>“How come he came this year?”</p>
<p>“Well…he normally doesn’t come out this far. But Laken knows him. He’s a friend of your [Emperor], so Laken got him to give him some presents for you all. Don’t ask more questions. Merry Christmas.”</p>
<p>She had a present for every child, but not all of them came forwards at once. One girl stood back. Ryoka turned to her, trying to give the girl her most sincere, not-scary smile.</p>
<p>“What about you, kid?”</p>
<p>The girl shook her head. She stared at the present in Ryoka’s hands, but then stepped back from it. She looked up at Ryoka with hollow eyes. And when she spoke, she broke Ryoka’s heart.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ve been good, Miss. My brother’s dead. He died in the snow and I couldn’t find him.”</p>
<p>“You—what?”</p>
<p>Ryoka paused. The smiles on the faces of the children around her died like dead lightbulbs. The adults fell still.</p>
<p>“It was the avalanche, Miss Runner. I woke up on top of the snow, but my brother—he was right with me when it hit. I dug down and around, but I couldn’t find him. He was right next to me. Right there. Just a few feet to the left. But I didn’t find him until the Emperor dug him up.”</p>
<p>The girl stared up at Ryoka, her eyes staring back through time. There were no tears in her eyes. They’d all fallen long ago.</p>
<p>Ryoka couldn’t get her throat to work at first. She hesitated, and then knelt next to the girl. When she spoke, it was very slowly, very carefully, looking the grief-stricken girl right in the eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry. It wasn’t your fault. I know you tried—you couldn’t have known. I’m so sorry. But you know what? I—don’t think that means you’re naughty.”</p>
<p>“You don’t?”</p>
<p>“I’m sure. Hey listen—what’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Anabelle, Miss.”</p>
<p>“Well, Anabelle, I think Laken agrees with me. You know why?”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because he told me to make sure Anabelle got a present. He told me to make sure you and every kid here got a present, understand? So he doesn’t think you’re naughty. In fact…he told me you might like this one especially.”</p>
<p>Ryoka pulled a present out of the bag and handed it to Anabelle. She took it, and stared down at the neat bow on it, looking lost.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you open it?”</p>
<p>“Are you sure? Did Emperor Laken really say that?”</p>
<p>Anabelle stared up at Ryoka, wanting to believe. And Ryoka lied. She lied straight to the girl’s face, and smiled because it was no lie but the truth.</p>
<p>“I’m sure. Here. Why don’t you open it? Just pull there.”</p>
<p>The girl pulled, and the wrapping fell away and she stared at the little doll, dressed up like an adventurer. Perhaps it was just coincidence that it was male, and it had blonde hair like hers. Or maybe it was magic. Faerie magic? Or just the magic of Christmas.</p>
<p>She began to cry. Ryoka reached out and gingerly hugged her. She whispered to the girl.</p>
<p>“You didn’t do anything wrong. That’s why Santa sent me. That’s why your [Emperor] brought all these presents. Now—why don’t we give you something good to eat?”</p>
<p>Anabelle sobbed into her coat and nodded. Ryoka looked back at the other children. They were teary-eyed as well, but that was fine. There was something important in those tears.</p>
<p>“Who wants to see what else I’ve brought with me?”</p>
<p>Hands rose hesitantly. Ryoka turned, and saw the adults standing, watching her. There was something in their eyes because they kept brushing at them. Hers too. Ryoka let Anabelle cling to her as she handed presents out. And then she had another thought.</p>
<p>“While we’re at it—why don’t I tell you a story? Would you like to hear a story? About Santa Claus?”</p>
<p>Ryoka sat on the straw floor of the barn and saw faeries land on the roof of the barn. She stared at them, but they made the interior of the building shimmer and glow. In every color. The villagers and children gasped, and Ryoka smiled.</p>
<p>“What are you staring at? Didn’t I say Santa was magic? Well, maybe he’s watching you. Now that I think of it…I’ll tell you stories about Santa, too! Did you know one of his reindeer has a red nose? Let me tell you about that. Once upon a time, on a night even snowier than this…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later then. So late that it was minutes away from becoming Christmas day, or the day Erin had decided was Christmas. She sat in her inn, her guests long gone, a pile of presents in one corner, and slowly cleared the last table.</p>
<p>“We’re done. Thank you so much for helping, Lyonette.”</p>
<p>“It was—nothing—Erin.”</p>
<p>Lyonette managed to get the words out between jaw-cracking yawns. She and Mrsha were dozing in a chair by the fire.</p>
<p>A single candle lit the room along with the fireplace. Mrsha stared at the flickering flame as it slowly wore down the wax candle. It was hypnotic, soothing. Before she knew it, Lyonette’s eyes were closing.</p>
<p>“You look tired. You should head upstairs.”</p>
<p>“I think Mrsha’s done. But she’s sort of restless. She had too much honey.”</p>
<p>Mrsha was indeed still awake, despite the late hour. She squirmed just a tiny bit, too hyped to sleep, but too tired to move. Erin smiled.</p>
<p>“Well, how shall we put her to bed? Hot milk? That always worked for me, or so my mom said.”</p>
<p>“I think she’s full to bursting. How about a song? I’d sing, but…I’m no [Singer]. Do you have the class?”</p>
<p>“I do, but you don’t have to have a class to sing, Lyonette. Why don’t I teach you some Christmas songs?”</p>
<p>“Oh. Can you? I’ve always liked music. They only sing the same songs in court back home…”</p>
<p>Lyonette sat up slightly, eyes shining. Mrsha perked her ears up too. Erin laughed and settled down in a chair across from them next to the fire.</p>
<p>“Why not. I’ll sing you…a classic song about Christmas. Okay?”</p>
<p>Silence was her only answer. Erin took a deep breath, and thought of the songs she’d heard growing up, when she had to go to the Christmas service at church, and sung by carolers and played on speakers and online as the world changed.</p>
<p>“<em>Silent night, holy night. All is calm, all is bright…</em>”</p>
<p>Her voice was the last thing anyone heard. The snow fell deeper, as across the world the night ended and a new day began. Nothing changed, but it was Christmas. And Erin sang.</p>
<p>“<em>Sleep in heavenly peace. Sleep in heavenly peace…</em>”</p>
<p>Her voice trailed off. Erin looked around and saw Lyonette and Mrsha had already fallen asleep. Erin sighed, glancing upstairs where their beds were waiting.</p>
<p>And she smiled. Just a bit. Erin stood up and found a blanket for the slumbering Mrsha and Lyonette. She took down the mistletoe and burned it in the fire. She took out the presents she’d wrapped for Klbkch and Relc and put them with the others. Then she stared out the window.</p>
<p>“Merry Christmas, everyone. To all good sleep. And too all…um. Wait. Oh well. Good night.”</p>
<p>Then she blew out the candle and went to sleep.</p>

		<p>And then…it was Christmas.</p>
<p>Erin was up before dawn again, rubbing at her eyes. She hauled water, helped Lyonette finish cleaning the room—and got food ready.</p>
<p>That was what it was. Food. Erin mechanically created and seasoned a fatty soup with sausage, mushroom, vegetable extract, flour, garlic, a hard-boiled egg…all added to a rye flour and water base that had been mixed several days ago.</p>
<p>Sour soup. It tasted better than described. That was course one. But Erin had far more to do. She fried little dumplings with meat in the center – a Drake favorite food&nbsp;– toasted kebabs in the Gnollish fashion, and finished with some good old Human decadency.</p>
<p>Hamburgers, pizza, popcorn…anything Erin could think of she made. Because she knew she was going to need it all.</p>
<p>Her adventurer guests came and went, eating breakfast, and then lunch. Erin kept cooking, getting ready for the real meal. From time to time she pulled a piece of paper out of her pocket and stared at it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>On a delivery. Emergency—a village needs supplies and food. Will try to be back in time for Christmas. Ryoka.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She’d received it from the Mage’s Guild. Erin stared at the paper each time, and then carefully folded it away. Each time the door opened she looked up hopefully. But it was never Ryoka. And eventually, Erin stopped looking for her. She had a job to do.</p>
<p>They began coming in at noon. First Relc, rubbing his hands and exclaiming with delight as he saw two presents with his name on it. Then Selys and Krshia and to Erin’s delight, a tired Brunkr. His arm was bandaged and cleaned and he managed to smile at her.</p>
<p>At some point, the door to Celum opened and Octavia fell through. She slept on the floor. After a while Jasi, Wesle, and the [Actors] came through, along with Maran and Safry. Miss Agnes was not there, but Grev darted in as well and stepped on Octavia’s head, waking her up.</p>
<p>After that, Pawn, Bird, Belgrade, and even Garry appeared. Erin had to come out of the kitchen to meet Garry and hug him. Anand was still in Esthelm, but the Antinium Workers had brought some more Workers and Soldiers with them. They sat in a corner while Garry offered his services to Erin. She accepted with relief and they went back into the kitchen.</p>
<p>The Horns of Hammerad hadn’t ever really left, but Pisces came in with Ksmvr with last-minute gifts. They joined Ceria and Yvlon, who were sitting and drinking with the Halfseekers.</p>
<p>Griffon Hunt came to the inn around the same time as Klbkch did. The Antinium was not with the adventurers; he snuck in, looking guiltier than Erin had ever seen him. The reason for that was obvious; an irate Xrn followed him into the inn later. She would have dragged Klbkch away, but Erin presented her with a deep-fried bee and she stayed.</p>
<p>Who else? Erin was beginning to lose track. She was surprised when Hawk appeared, looking wide-eyed at her multitude of guests, but she had sent him an invitation too, hadn’t she? And then came other people, Selys’s Drake friends, some Gnolls that Krshia knew, more people from Celum…</p>
<p>One person came last, as the party was underway. Zel Shivertail stood at Liscor’s gates, shivering a bit as the wind froze his scales. It was <em>cold</em>, far colder than yesterday. He would love to be inside and drinking some of the ‘eggnog’ that Erin had made. But he was outside, listening to someone he really didn’t care for.</p>
<p>“If you’re so worried, come and join the party yourself.”</p>
<p>He snapped at Ilvriss as the Lord of the Wall stood, warm and comfortable in his heavy fur coat and enchanted clothing. The other Drake stared at Zel Shivertail with a look of incredulity.</p>
<p>“I would rather <em>eat</em> my tail than sit in the same room with one of the Ants. You seem to be able to tolerate them—and all those Humans. I am simply telling you what to look out for.”</p>
<p>“I know what to look for. Anything. We don’t know why Xrn and the other Antinium are here. Your precious city leaders and councils have oh so many suspicions and fears, but you know nothing.”</p>
<p>Zel growled at Ilvriss. The Lord of the Wall was unmoved. He glanced towards the inn with a sour expression.</p>
<p>“Just listen and don’t drink yourself under the table, Shivertail. We have a duty. You and I might have come north looking for that Human Runner, but this is far bigger than either of us.”</p>
<p>“Don’t I know it. I’ll keep an earhole open, don’t you worry.”</p>
<p>The [General] turned away from Ilvriss. He began stomping towards the inn, moving quickly to keep out of the cold.</p>
<p>Quickly for Zel meant that he reached the inn in three minutes. He was still half-frozen by the time he did, but opening the door and feeling the warm rush of air on his scales and smelling all the delicious scents in the air made everything worth it.</p>
<p>“Uncle!”</p>
<p>Someone called his name. Zel looked around and smiled as he saw his favorite niece. The one who didn’t treat him like a living legend. Selys was sitting at a table with Mrsha, the Gnoll named Krshia, Olesm, and—Zel’s smile faltered a bit—Pawn.</p>
<p>The Drake only hesitated for a second. He came over and smiled as everyone welcomed him. He didn’t sit next to Pawn, but he didn’t sit far away from the Antinium either. Pawn he could tolerate.</p>
<p>“Uncle, I think that blue Antinium’s here. So is Klbkch. Don’t make a scene.”</p>
<p>Selys warned Zel, which was probably wise. The [General] stiffened, but Selys deposited Mrsha in his lap. The Gnoll stared soulfully up into Zel’s eyes and a crisis was averted.</p>
<p>Running about the inn, Erin felt like all was crisis. She lifted a pan up and yelped as the hot handle scorched her hands. She would have dropped the pan filled with fried ground beef and onions, but someone caught it by the base.</p>
<p>“Are you alright, Miss Erin?”</p>
<p>Garry held the hot pan without a care in the world. Erin blew on her hands as he put the meat back on the stove.</p>
<p>“Great, Garry! Your carapace is awesome, you know that?”</p>
<p>“It is a very helpful aid when I handle hot or cold objects. Or cut myself.”</p>
<p>Garry nodded. He lifted a basket of Erin’s new, ultra-fluffy bread up and carried it out into the common room. Erin followed him with a pot of butter and another one of honey.</p>
<p>Noise. And people calling her name. Erin smiled as people eating and laughing and playing games turned and waved at her. She put the food down in the center of the room and saw Mrsha leap off of Zel’s lap and make a beeline towards the food.</p>
<p>Someone who made a beeline towards Erin was Revi. The Stitch-girl [Mage] put her hands on her hips.</p>
<p>“Erin, please tell Octavia to <em>stop</em> trying to sell me things! Just because we’re both the same species doesn’t mean I’ll buy her insane potions.”</p>
<p>“I’ll have a word with her. Would you like some bread?”</p>
<p>Erin dealt with Revi as someone else came up to take a few warm buns and slather them with honey and butter.</p>
<p>“Miss Solstice, are you sure you have enough food for me? I am quite fine eating whatever—”</p>
<p>“I’m fine! Eat! Eat!”</p>
<p>The girl turned and smiled up at Moore. He smiled back and ducked his head. As the half-Giant walked back to his table where a bunch of the adventurers had gathered, he passed by two arguing Antinium. One, a slim Antinium with blue carapace, unique among her kind, was not happy with the other.</p>
<p>“You have run off to this inn and avoided speaking with me for the <em>fifth</em> time, Klbkch. What attracts you so?”</p>
<p>Klbkch the Slayer, one of the legendary Centenium, Revelantor of the Free Antinium of Liscor and acting Prognugator, hunched his shoulders as Xrn glared at him.</p>
<p>“It is Christmas. This is an important tradition that I must undertake to spread goodwill—”</p>
<p>“You spend all your time <em>eating</em> and talking with that Human. Does your Queen know you’re doing this?”</p>
<p>He did not reply. Xrn made an exasperated hissing-click that needed no translation.</p>
<p>“Once I am done eating this bee, you and I are going back to the Hive. We must talk, Klbkch.”</p>
<p>“But I have to obtain my presents.”</p>
<p>“That is no—what kind of presents? And is that honey I see over there?”</p>
<p>Xrn grew distracted as she saw the fluffy bread, sitting appetizingly on one table. She knew the Antinium could not process gluten well, but she could still desire to taste the food.</p>
<p>“Honored Prognugator Xrn.”</p>
<p>A voice interrupted Xrn as Klbkch was sinking down in his seat. Both Antinium looked up. Ksmvr cringed as he bowed, but he still offered her the small trinket in his third hand.</p>
<p>“What is this? And who are you?”</p>
<p>“I was the Prognugator for the Hive until my…failures. However, I see your gaze upon the bread. I would like to give you this small token, that you might eat it.”</p>
<p>He offered Xrn the trinket he’d taken from the dead Goblin that resisted food poisoning. Xrn stared at the amulet, and then at Ksmvr. She closed his hand over the trinket.</p>
<p>“Fascinating. Thank you, Ksmvr. I have seen the spell and will copy it. Your help is appreciated.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr was stunned. He bowed and retreated, staring once at Klbkch. Xrn muttered to herself and tapped her chest, replicating the spell she had just seen.</p>
<p>“I had no idea such a spell existed. I did not look or think of it until now, but this is extraordinary. I should like to taste that bread.”</p>
<p>Beside her, Klbkch sat up.</p>
<p>“Will you cast that spell on me?”</p>
<p>“No. You do not deserve it. Why did you exile that poor Antinium, Klbkch? And why does he look like a copy of your former self? He walks like you. What has your Queen been up to?”</p>
<p>“It is a long story. If I tell you, will you cast the spell on me as well?”</p>
<p>As the two Antinium sat together, Ksmvr passed by Erin on his way back to the Horns of Hammerad. He saw her desperately calling for Lyonette to help her; she was balancing at least eleven dishes together on her way back to the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Let me.”</p>
<p>Ksmvr was preempted from helping by Typhenous. The mage lifted the mess of plates up and walked into the kitchen. Erin sighed with relief.</p>
<p>“Thank you so much!”</p>
<p>“Sorry, Erin! I was running to get more water!”</p>
<p>Lyonette came over, puffing from her run outside with the buckets. Erin saw several basins full of snow lined up by the fire, melting into water.</p>
<p>“It’s fine, Lyonette. Go back to serving if you’ve got time—I think Garry’s got the pizzas all ready. Now—who was calling my name?”</p>
<p>She went over and found Jasi wringing her hands. Grev was sitting at the table, glaring at Wesle as the former [Guardsman] hunched over in his seat. Erin didn’t see Relc at first; he was trying to hide under the table.</p>
<p>“What’s wr—”</p>
<p>She felt the cold air and saw a hole and the broken glass. Jasi explained.</p>
<p>“They were playing a knife flipping game, but Wesle lost his grip and—I’m so sorry, Erin!”</p>
<p>“No problem. It’s no problem—I’ll just uh, board that up—”</p>
<p>Erin ran off. Relc came out under the table.</p>
<p>“Oops. How mad was she?”</p>
<p>It was Krshia who saw Erin run back with a hammer and nails and a piece of wood. The Gnoll stood up to offer Erin a paw, but Brunkr, sitting beside her, suddenly hissed and grabbed his Aunt with his good hand.</p>
<p>“<em>Aunt!</em> That’s Zel Shivertail sitting there! I knew I’d seen his face before! That’s him! The <em>Tidebreaker!</em>”</p>
<p>“Of course he is. He stays at Erin’s inn, yes?”</p>
<p>Krshia shook her head as Brunkr goggled at her.</p>
<p>“If you’d been out at any time, you would have learned this. Go talk to him if you are so desperate.”</p>
<p>“Talk? Me?”</p>
<p>Across the room, Halrac’s keen ears heard Erin yelp. He saw her blowing on a finger she’d accidentally hammered and lowered his mug.</p>
<p>“Why’s she got a hammer?”</p>
<p>Ulrien, sitting next to him followed Halrac’s gaze. The [Scout] grunted irritably.</p>
<p>“Someone broke a window.”</p>
<p>“That’s why glass is risky.”</p>
<p>Halrac’s longtime comrade shook his head. Ulrien gazed at Erin as she took her tools away and stared at the rough patch on the window. The big man nodded to the [Innkeeper].</p>
<p>“Your friend seems tired.”</p>
<p>“She’s not my friend. And she’s fine. She’s smiling.”</p>
<p>Halrac glared at Ulrien, but the leader of Griffon Hunt pushed his mug back and shook his head.</p>
<p>“How can you be a [Veteran Scout] with over 30 levels in your class and still not see the obvious, Halrac? Look at her. She’s smiling, but she’s exhausted.”</p>
<p>The [Scout] looked, and this time he saw Ulrien was right. Erin was smiling, but she nearly tripped over her own bucket bringing it back into the kitchen. She had rings around her eyes.</p>
<p>“She needs to hire someone else. Running an inn’s no job for just her and a [Barmaid].”</p>
<p>That came from Hawk. He was sitting with Halrac and Ulrien, having made their acquaintance earlier today. He’d actually met them a few times while running deliveries, hence their easy camaraderie.</p>
<p>All three males watched as Erin ran over to help Garry and Lyonette put a positively gargantuan platter of barbequed ribs on the table. Erin rushed into the kitchen and came out with the fried potato strips she called ‘fries’.</p>
<p>“A hard worker. You were right when you said we should stay here, Halrac.”</p>
<p>Ulrien raised his mug and took a drink. He tilted it up for the dregs. Hawk nodded, looking hungrily at the fries. Some were made of sweet potatoes, and reminded him of carrots.</p>
<p>“This inn is hopping. And the food is excellent! I’d heard that Erin came up with new food every other day, but this is just impressive. You wouldn’t happen to know if anyone’s planning on moving out, would you? I’d love to rent a room…”</p>
<p>“Oh Erin! Erin!”</p>
<p>Halrac gritted his teeth as a familiar voice called out Erin’s name for the seventh time that night. Erin came over a bit slower than usual, because Revi was the one waving her hand.</p>
<p>“We need a refill! We’ve been waiting for five minutes already!”</p>
<p>“Coming up!”</p>
<p>Erin ran off. Halrac glared at Revi, sitting at the table behind him.</p>
<p>“Stop pestering her. Can’t you see she’s busy?”</p>
<p>Revi gave Halrac the condescending look he hated so much.</p>
<p>“She’s an <em>innkeeper</em>, Halrac. This is her job. If she’s too busy to serve drinks, she should hire someone else to help!”</p>
<p>“That’s what I said!”</p>
<p>Hawk leaned around Halrac to speak to Revi.</p>
<p>“Did you know there used to be a skeleton that helped around the inn? It was the talk of the city! I wonder what happened to it…”</p>
<p>Pisces could have told Hawk, or any of the Horns of Hammerad. But they were all busy watching Belgrade and Pawn take on the entire room at the tables where the game of Go was being played.</p>
<p>The two Antinium played anyone and everyone who sat at their tables. They moved their hands quickly, placing white and black stones, easily defeating most players. Pisces and Pawn were engaged in a heated speed-battle where each player had only a second to place a stone, while Belgrade dueled Olesm in a slower, more thoughtful match.</p>
<p>“Erin! Hey, Erin!”</p>
<p>Ceria waved at Erin and the girl skidded to a halt as she carried drinks over to Griffon Hunt. In the background Revi groaned loudly.</p>
<p>“What is it, Ceria? Emergency? Need something?”</p>
<p>Erin tried to wipe sweat off of her forehead as she turned towards Ceria. The half-Elf shook her head. She raised a half-devoured rib and pointed to it.</p>
<p>“Good meat! I love the sauce!”</p>
<p>Erin stared at Ceria for a second. She opened her mouth, and then turned and hurried off.</p>
<p>“Erin! <em>Erin!</em> Hey, Erin! I dropped my fork and can’t find it! I need another!”</p>
<p>“When are we opening presents?”</p>
<p>“Do you have more vegetables? Too much meat gives me gas.”</p>
<p>“<strong>I’m sorry, but I need another bucket of water. Too much heat. Do you have any on hand?</strong>”</p>
<p>Erin measured the minutes by the requests she got. She ran back and forth, smiling trying to avoid adding to the mess on the floors, and serving drinks and food in between.&nbsp; She wasn’t aware of the time until Revi spoke up as Erin was serving her another drink.</p>
<p>“Is there any entertainment for the night? Or are we supposed to watch the Ants play that board game and chat and eat?”</p>
<p>The [Innkeeper] paused as Halrac and Ulrien both glared at Revi and she steadfastly ignored them.</p>
<p>“Entertainment? Um, like what? More alcohol?”</p>
<p>“No! Don’t you have someone who plays the lute, or tells stories?”</p>
<p>Revi stared around the room, eying the group of [Actors] hopefully. Erin wondered if they’d be able to perform, but her heart sank as she realized half of them were so drunk they could barely sit straight.</p>
<p>“I’ll see what I can do.”</p>
<p>“Why not sing?”</p>
<p>A laughing Drake who’d heard their conversation called that out. Erin turned towards him—he was one of Selys’ friends and had scales which were pink. He might have claimed they were red, but they were more pink than red in Erin’s eyes.</p>
<p>“What? Sing?”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you the Human who sang that one time? I heard the music on Hessal Street, halfway across the city!”</p>
<p>“That’s right! You could sing, Erin!”</p>
<p>Selys stood up and called it out. Heads turned, and after the guests at the inn pieced together what was going on, more raised their voices in approval.</p>
<p>“Sing!”</p>
<p>“I loved that song about defeating the Huns! Nice war song! Who are they?”</p>
<p>Ceria, sitting at a table and trying to talk herself out of eating another rib, sat up and nudged Yvlon. The woman stared as Erin was bombarded by calls to sing.</p>
<p>“Songs, huh? I remember Erin singing.”</p>
<p>Yvlon stared at Ceria. Their eyes found a table in the center of the room. Both remembered Erin singing. In a room full of adventurers, as she held an injured Pawn, singing into the night.</p>
<p>The half-Elf held her breath as Erin made her way into the center of the room. Erin was blushing, looking harried by all the pressure on her. But she obligingly grabbed a wooden spoon and used it as a fake microphone.</p>
<p>“Attention! Attention, everyone! I guess it’s song time! I’m going to sing you a few Christmas songs from home—I hope you like them!”</p>
<p>“Finally.”</p>
<p>Revi muttered and got a jab from Belgrade in the side as the Antinium went back to sit at their table.</p>
<p>Standing in the center of the room, Erin wiped sweat off of her face and tried to think of a good song to sing. She felt so tired. But this was Christmas, and she had guests to entertain!</p>
<p>“This one’s a song I hear—heard all the time back at home. Jingle bells!”</p>
<p>She took a breath, and people cheered. Erin closed her eyes—</p>
<p>And remembered.</p>
<p>The sounds around her faded. Part of it was people growing quiet, listening to her sing. But another part was different. It might have been magic, it might have been her Skill. But the guests in her inn suddenly heard a ringing bell, a beating drum, and then Erin’s voice, singing a song from childhood. From home.</p>
<p>“<em>Dashing through the snow on a one-horse open sleigh, o’er the fields we go, laughing all the way…</em>”</p>
<p>Home. It was something she’d avoided thinking of. But here, in this moment, in this place, Erin couldn’t escape. So she gave voice to that feeling her chest, the memories.</p>
<p><em>Home.</em></p>
<p>Maybe that was why the next song she sung wasn’t a Christmas carol. Erin sang a song from the band Journey. The classic. The story in the song that she’d danced to so many times as a kid. The song played in the 3<sup>rd</sup> Season of Scrubs.</p>
<p><em>Don’t Stop Believing</em>. The crowd in her inn cheered wildly when Erin was done. Some of them were rubbing their ears and staring around the inn for the drums and electric guitars that had been playing—others just sat, listening with mouths open to a type of music that had not existed in their world until now.</p>
<p>Erin smiled as people cheered her on, demanding another song. She immediately launched into the classic she’d sung for Lyonette and Mrsha, <em>Silent</em> <em>Night.</em> She sang with her eyelids shut. She wasn’t standing in her inn anymore. She was somewhere else.</p>
<p>Where would she be if she were at home? She’d be…she’d be in her living room, eating with her mom and dad. She’d probably be laughing and eying the presents under the tree. Knowing her father, he’d have bought her some chess guide or a new board—her mom would get Erin some tasteful clothing that Erin had hinted she wanted. And Erin would be looking forwards to seeing her parent’s reactions for the presents she’d bought.</p>
<p>Or—Erin’s voice faltered. Would she be in college? She would have been in college after her one year break. Erin would probably have come home for the holidays, but—</p>
<p>“Erin?”</p>
<p>She looked around, and realized the song had ended. People were waiting for the next song. Erin smiled. She felt something building in her heart. She searched for a song, and couldn’t think of anything off the top of her head.</p>
<p>“Um—what should I sing next? Another Christmas song? Okay. Then I’ll sing…”</p>
<p>It came to her without thinking.</p>
<p>“How about <em>Home For the Holidays</em>? Anyone heard that song? Well—”</p>
<p>Erin smiled faintly as people cheered and clapped. She took a deep breath and began. There was no accompaniment for this song. It wasn’t an immortal moment. Erin felt her heart beating slowly as she began to sing, mechanically reciting the song she’d heard so many times.</p>
<p>“<em>Oh there’s no place like home for the holidays—</em>”</p>
<p>Only when she was halfway through did Erin’s mind catch up with what she was singing. She paused, and people looked up. She coughed, and felt something in her <em>stop.</em> The people who’d been swaying to the music paused and looked at her. She tapped her throat, cleared it.</p>
<p>“Sorry. Something was in my throat. Let me try again.”</p>
<p>She opened her mouth, and tried again.</p>
<p>“Oh there’s no place like <em>home </em>for the—”</p>
<p>Again she broke off. This time, the noise in the inn died. Erin lowered the wooden spoon in her hands.</p>
<p>Something was wrong. Her eyes were stinging, and the world was getting fuzzy. Erin tried again. She took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“There’s no place like…”</p>
<p>Silence. Every eye was on Erin. The people in her inn had stopped. They stared at the girl standing in the center of the room. Erin’s cheeks were flushed, her eyes bright. The last word she’d meant to sing died unspoken.</p>
<p>She dropped the spoon. It landed on the floor with a clatter. Erin looked around. Her eyes were bright and overfull. The word echoed in her mind, in her heart.</p>
<p><em>Home</em>.</p>
<p>She wasn’t home. She was far from home. And though she’d tried to forget, Erin couldn’t. She remembered her parents, her home. Her friends. They weren’t here. This wasn’t her world.</p>
<p>Standing in the center of the room, Erin blinked and then lost the smile that she’d kept on her face for so long. Her mouth turned down.</p>
<p>She couldn’t stop it, no matter how hard she tried. The world blurred. Erin’s shoulders shook. Slowly tears rolled down her cheeks and fell onto the floor of the inn.</p>
<p><em>Drip. Drip.</em></p>
<p>Erin covered her mouth with her hands. She pressed the heels of her hands against her eyes, but the tears wouldn’t stop.</p>
<p>Home. She missed <em>home!</em> She wanted to see her mom and dad again. She wanted to go to her room. She wanted it so badly that Erin couldn’t do anything but cry.</p>
<p>No one could speak. Erin looked around, tears falling, unable to speak. Wide-eyed faces stared up at her, people soundlessly gazing at her.</p>
<p>She made the smallest noise, and then turned. Erin ran for the door to her inn and flung it open. She disappeared into the snowy night. The inn’s door slammed shut behind her.</p>
<p>For a second no one spoke. All of Erin’s guests stared at the closed door. Then Mrsha began to howl, and everyone began shouting at once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first few minutes were all chaos. Mrsha ran for the door, only to be caught by Lyonette. Ceria stood up and wanted to go after Erin, but Yvlon pulled her back. The Human woman tried to tell Ceria to let Erin grieve by herself at the same time Grev burst into tears and Klbkch flipped his table and stood up.</p>
<p>Some people went for the doors, but others got in the way or had other opinions. The noise was so intense that it became impossible to think or make sense of any individual voice.</p>
<p>In the end, Relc leapt onto a table and bellowed at the top of his lungs.</p>
<p>“Alright. Everyone <em>shut up!</em>”</p>
<p>He had a voice used to shouting in the middle of battles and over noisy crowds. Everyone grew quieter as they stared at Relc. The Drake looked around the room, and then hopped off the table.</p>
<p>“Damnit.”</p>
<p>He kicked at a fallen cup. Relc stared at the door and sighed heavily.</p>
<p>“Someone should go after her. It’s cold out there. And there’s Rock Crabs and Shield Spiders hiding in the snow.”</p>
<p>“I’ll go.”</p>
<p>Klbkch, Halrac, Pawn, Olesm, Krshia, Selys, Ceria—there were fewer people who remained sitting. But it was Pisces who appeared at the door in an instant with his [Flash Step] spell. The mage looked around the room.</p>
<p>“I shall go. Discreetly. I know [Invisibility]—I shall make sure she doesn’t freeze and keep any monsters away until she returns.”</p>
<p>No one had anything to say, so Pisces opened the door and disappeared into the night. The others sat down and began talking amongst themselves anxiously in low voices.</p>
<p>“Happy?”</p>
<p>Halrac snarled at Revi. The Stitch-girl raised her hands, looking upset.</p>
<p>“Don’t glare at me! It wasn’t my fault! Why did she start crying like that?”</p>
<p>“Because she’s <em>homesick</em>, you idiot! And she’s worked too hard putting this party on!”</p>
<p>“Well, how is that <em>my </em>fault?”</p>
<p>Revi’s raised voice attracted a few dark looks, but people were more concerned with Erin. Selys stroked Mrsha’s head as the Gnoll clung to Lyonette and buried her face in the girl’s shirt.</p>
<p>“I had no idea Erin was feeling so down. She didn’t say anything to me, and we’re best friends!”</p>
<p>“I say it’s all the work she’s been doing. Halrac is right—she needs a rest. And a friend. We should see if she wants to talk when she gets back.”</p>
<p>Ceria put her head in her hands as she sat at a table with Yvlon, Ksmvr, and the Halfseekers. She felt her own eyes stinging and brushed angrily at them.</p>
<p>“We should have been helping out and keeping her company instead of drinking and doing nothing! We should take tomorrow off and—just be there with her.”</p>
<p>Yvlon and Ksmvr agreed to the idea and Ceria saw other people nodding in agreement around the room. But it was Relc of all people who stared at the ceiling and shook his head.</p>
<p>“Naw, that’s stupid.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Ceria turned and glared at him. The Drake sighed. He looked older as he sat in a chair and leaned back.</p>
<p>“You know what we should do? We should leave her alone. If anyone stays here, she’ll just look after <em>them.</em> That’s what she does. Look after people. She’s a weird Human like that.”</p>
<p>The half-Elf opened her mouth to retort angrily, and then closed it. At his table, Ulrien nodded.</p>
<p>“That’s true. If we’re here, she has a job. We’re her customers, not just her friends. I say tomorrow, we all go into the city and give her the space she needs. We eat, and sleep there if we can manage it.”</p>
<p>“Ulrien!”</p>
<p>Revi protested. He looked hard at her.</p>
<p>“It’s what’s right, Revi. We won’t have a problem occupying ourselves for one day. And in the meantime, anyone who wants to talk with Erin can. But I think the Drake’s right. Giving Erin time alone is what she needs.”</p>
<p>“My name’s Relc, asshole.”</p>
<p>The other guests of Erin’s inn were in agreement. Selys was still very upset, though. She paced back and forth in front of her table.</p>
<p>“I just—I don’t know what to tell Erin! She wants to go home? Where’s she from? Terandria? Baleros? Chandrar? She’s never talked about it once!”</p>
<p>She looked at Krshia.</p>
<p>“Where’s Erin from? Has she told you?”</p>
<p>The Gnoll shifted, and looked around the room. Brunkr, who’d put his head down, raised it warily. Krshia nodded at the door.</p>
<p>“I have some knowledge of her home, but it is not for me to say, no. I am sorry, Selys. But Erin is a girl of many secrets. Her home is one of them, and few know of it.”</p>
<p>“Some know. Or have guessed.”</p>
<p>Ceria folded her arms frowning at the door as well. She was talking about Pisces, whom she was sure knew more than her.</p>
<p>“How hard is it to find out? Erin’s got to have said something to someone. Why’s going back so hard? Does she not have enough coin to pay her way home? Is she an outcast? What?”</p>
<p>Wesle’s face was filled with honest confusion. He looked around.</p>
<p>“I mean, she’s never spoken to me about it. But where’s her home?”</p>
<p>No one knew. And those that did weren’t saying. Yvlon sat with some of the others, frowning as they talked it over.</p>
<p>“She didn’t know about Terandrian nations. And she’s not from Chandrar.”</p>
<p>“Are you certain?”</p>
<p>Olesm nodded. He was toying with a chess piece, tail twitching with emotion.</p>
<p>“Yeah. She didn’t know about the King of Destruction.”</p>
<p>Yvlon shook her head.</p>
<p>“What, him waking up? That’s big news, but—”</p>
<p>“No, she didn’t know about the King of Destruction <em>at all</em>.”</p>
<p>“You’re kidding. Then is she from Baleros?”</p>
<p>“Hardly. Remember Gazi? She told me she’d never met a Gazer before in her life! She thought Gazi was a full Gazer, not a half-Gazer!”</p>
<p>Jelaqua walked over, suddenly alert. She stared at the others.</p>
<p>“Wait, Gazi? You mean, <em>Gazi the Omniscient? </em>That monster? How does a girl like Erin know <em>her?</em>”</p>
<p>“She poked Gazi’s eye out.”</p>
<p>“She <em>what?</em>”</p>
<p>Amid the second uproar, Halrac ground his teeth. He grabbed the wooden spoon Erin had dropped and <em>snapped</em> it with a twist of his hands. The sound of breaking wood echoed through the room like a gunshot. Everyone stared at the [Scout]. Halrac’s face was red and he looked angrier than anyone but Ulrien had ever seen him.</p>
<p>“None of this is helpful. So Erin doesn’t seem like she’s from one of the four main continents. So <em>where</em> did she come from?”</p>
<p>“The same place as Ryoka Griffin.”</p>
<p>Ceria spoke quietly, tracing a pattern in the spilled ale on one of the tables and freezing the liquid with the tip of her skeletal finger. Everyone fell silent at this. Those who didn’t know Ryoka asked who she was and got varied responses.</p>
<p>Someone else reacted strongly to Ryoka’s name. Zel’s head turned ever so slightly. But he said not a word as he leaned against the kitchen doorframe. Only Mrsha saw his entire body <em>tense</em> and the claws on his feet dig into the floorboards.</p>
<p>“Hold on, if Erin’s from the same place as that Runner chick, she <em>can’t</em> be nearby. There’s no one who looks like her in Izril, I’m certain.”</p>
<p>Relc scratched the spines on his head as he frowned. Yvlon nodded.</p>
<p>“She’s an islander. From far across the seas, I thought. Is Erin from there?”</p>
<p>“No, she can’t be! She never mentioned getting on a ship to me when we met.”</p>
<p>All eyes were on Relc. Standing against the far wall, Klbkch stared at his partner as Relc tried to puzzle out Erin’s origins out loud.</p>
<p>“You see, Klb and I, we were the first people who met her. In this inn. Well, not <em>this</em> inn, but the old one. We saw smoke coming out of the chimney one day while we were on patrol. We came to investigate whether bandits or fugitives were hiding out here, and found…her. Just living here.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t ask how she came here?”</p>
<p>Ceria stared incredulously at Relc. He raised his claws.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t our business! She said it might have been a teleportation spell, but she wasn’t&nbsp;<em>actually</em> sure how she ended up around Liscor. Besides, none of the [Mages] detected any magic that night when we asked them, so I thought she was mistaken. That’s as far as we looked into it.”</p>
<p>“That’s <em>all </em>you did?”</p>
<p>“We were busy! She wasn’t a wanted criminal anywhere—and believe me, the Captain had us check. She was just some strange Human who came here out of nowhere. Funny thing, though…”</p>
<p>The Drake paused and scratched at his chin.</p>
<p>“She can’t have come from the south. It’s way too dangerous for someone who’s not a Runner or warrior to travel alone, and Erin didn’t have any potions or weapons on her. And if she’d come down the northern road someone would have mentioned her, right? I remember traffic was good that day, but no one talked about a girl like her when we asked if they’d seen her.”</p>
<p>“So what?”</p>
<p>“So…I don’t get how she got here. Liscor’s surrounded by mountains. Really <em>big </em>mountains. There’s no way she could climb the High Passes, not with no levels…wait, she did say she was from some place. Hold on. What was it called?”</p>
<p>Everyone waited. Relc scratched his head.</p>
<p>“What was the place called? Michi…Missia…hm. Nope. I don’t recall.”</p>
<p>Expectant breaths were released. The listeners shook their heads as Relc shrugged helplessly.</p>
<p>“No levels?”</p>
<p>Typhenous frowned. Relc nodded absently.</p>
<p>“Yeah. She only had like four levels in [Innkeeper]. But nothing else. That’s what she said.”</p>
<p>“Strange.”</p>
<p>“You’re telling me. Wait, now I remember…Erin said she ran away from something. Oh yeah, she said she ran away from a <em>Dragon</em> when she got here. I remember thinking how crazy she was!”</p>
<p>“A Dragon?”</p>
<p>The room stirred. Jasi exchanged a wide-eyed glance with the other Humans from Celum. Olesm and the other Drakes looked just as incredulous as Relc.</p>
<p>“There’s no way.”</p>
<p>“Right, I mean, that’s what Klb and I thought. She must have run from a Wyvern, right? Only, her arm was burned. A fire breathing Wyvern, I guess.”</p>
<p><strong>“I find it hard to believe that girl would confuse a Wyvern with a Dragon.”</strong></p>
<p>Seborn nodded to the door. Relc shrugged.</p>
<p>“Come on, it can’t have been a <em>Dragon</em>. She probably just thought it was because she’d never seen a Wyvern before.”</p>
<p>“If it was a Wyvern, why didn’t it run her down?”</p>
<p>Halrac stared at a scar on his arm. Ulrien nodded as everyone turned towards their table.</p>
<p>“Wyverns are fast hunters. They don’t give up on their prey. Even if she was running at night, it would have swooped down on her. Unless she had tree cover, and the area around Liscor has virtually no trees.”</p>
<p>“Except the ones that go ‘boom’. Yeah. Okay. But—nah, it was probably a huge salamander. That breathes fire. It’s not a Dragon, right Klbkch?”</p>
<p>Relc turned towards Klbkch. The Antinium was silent for a moment as every eye fell on him. Then he nodded.</p>
<p>“The odds of a Dragon living near Liscor are remote. It is highly unlikely it was a Dragon that Erin saw.”</p>
<p>“Right, there was no Dragon.”</p>
<p>“That is a reasonable assumption, yes.”</p>
<p>The Drake [Guardsman] nodded. He turned back to the others.</p>
<p>“The only reason I’m mentioning it, see, is because Erin said she was running away from that. So she might have come from…Esthelm? Only she didn’t know that city…damn. If it was a Dragon, it could have teleported her, since Dragons can do all kinds of things like that, right? But if it wasn’t a Dragon…did she say she was ever on a ship…? Let me think.”</p>
<p>The others kept conferring. But sitting at his table with Jasi, Grev wiped at his face and then stared at Klbkch. He looked back at the others, and then raised his hand.</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>No one heard him. Grev hesitated, and then called out.</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>All the adults turned to look at him. Some, like Halrac, were annoyed. Grev quailed, but he said his bit determinedly as he pointed to Klbkch.</p>
<p>“He never said there were no Dragons. That Ant man.”</p>
<p>“What? Grev, don’t interrupt—”</p>
<p>“No, wait. What did you say?”</p>
<p>Zel raised his claw and came away from the kitchen’s entrance. He stared at Grev. The boy gulped, but went on, stammering as everyone looked at him.</p>
<p>“He—it’s a trick, see? In the city. You learn to listen for it. If someone don’t <em>say</em> something’s true or not true, they’re not lying, see? But they’re still not saying if it’s true or not. That K—Kb—that guy said it weren’t <em>likely</em> Dragons were around Liscor. But he never said they wasn’t.”</p>
<p>The room grew very, very quiet. All heads turned to Klbkch. He sat next to Xrn, the overturned table at his feet. The blue Antinium was staring at Klbkch. But the Antinium said nothing.</p>
<p>“Hah! There are no Dragons. Tell him, Klbkch!”</p>
<p>Relc laughed nervously as he stared at his partner. Klbkch said nothing.</p>
<p>Krshia cleared her throat with a rumble.</p>
<p>“Why do you say nothing, Klbkch? Is it as the Human child says? We have Skills, yes. Skills to detect lying among those in this room. Say there are no Dragons and we shall know. Unless you are a deceiver of the highest level.”</p>
<p>Still, Klbkch said nothing. Relc lost his nervous grin. Ceria felt her heart begin to beat faster.</p>
<p>“Klb? Hey, buddy…”</p>
<p>There was no way for Klbkch to get out of it. Even Pawn and the other Antinium were staring at him. At last, Klbkch nodded and looked around the room coldly.</p>
<p>“Regrettable. I will say nothing on this matter.”</p>
<p>That was all. But his words were confirmation enough.</p>
<p>“Dead gods!”</p>
<p>Typhenous knocked his chair back. Halrac’s hand had gone white on his mug. Ulrien was staring. The Halfseekers seemed paralyzed. Ceria felt like her heart was about to beat out of her chest.</p>
<p>And those who weren’t adventurers were stunned. Selys gaped at Klbkch. She whispered a word.</p>
<p>“Ancestors.”</p>
<p>Zel felt his heart beating faster than he could ever remember. He stared at Klbkch. A Dragon. Could it be? He saw Relc’s mouth hanging open and Olesm, scales white as a sheet. The Ancestors, the First Parents. How long had it been since a Dragon had been seen on Izril—no, anywhere in the world?</p>
<p>Chance sightings. Stolen cattle, or strange burn marks. That was the rumor. But a real Dragon sighting? A Dragon? Here?</p>
<p>He couldn’t believe it. No one could. But the Antinium who knew the truth had confirmed it by not denying it. Or had he? Was it just a trick that played on the faintest possibility? Zel’s eyes narrowed as he stared at Klbkch.</p>
<p>The Antinium was unmoved. He stared around the room, at the eyes on him and the countless unanswered questions on everyone’s tongue. And it was clear he meant to answer none of them.</p>
<p>“Regardless of what you may believe, it is not in the best interests of my Hive for me to reveal any information confirming or denying your suspicions. I bear many of you no ill will, but I do not see you as comrades either. Erin Solstice I consider my friend, but her friends are not mine. You are all dust.”</p>
<p>His expressionless face was turned towards the place where Revi stood. Or perhaps it was Zel he was staring at.</p>
<p>The [General] moved forwards slowly. The people in the center of the room backed away as he walked to face Klbkch. Zel was standing straight, and there was the same hostility in his gaze as when he’d first laid eyes on Klbkch.</p>
<p>“If there is a Dragon on the continent, I think we should know about it.”</p>
<p>“Oh? I was not aware I answered to you.”</p>
<p>Klbkch slowly stood up from his chair. He seemed—angry. That was what Relc noticed. It wasn’t a word he’d ever had to use to describe his friend. But he saw it in the way Klbkch stood, and the way his hands hovered close to his swords.</p>
<p>“Hey, Klb, buddy. Hold on, you’re talking to a real hero here. General Shivertail—excuse my friend. Klbkch, come on. I served with General Zel during the war. He’s practically a pal…”</p>
<p>“He is not my friend. He killed two of the beings I called friend. Two of my comrades fell at his claws, never to rise again.”</p>
<p>Klbkch stared at Zel. The Drake felt the electric bond of hatred surging between them. He nodded, uncurling his fists into claws at his side.</p>
<p>“I fought against you in the war, Klbkch the Slayer. And as far as I’m concerned, the war never ended. Not with the Antinium. Your kind don’t know peace. So if you’re plotting something with a <em>Dragon—</em>”</p>
<p>“What my kind does is our affair, Zel Shivertail. It may be there is no Dragon and that I am simply tricking you. As I recall, you fell quite easily for such tricks during the war.”</p>
<p>That was it. Zel felt a spark ignite something in his breast. He took a step—</p>
<p>And a shadow fell over him. Zel turned his head and saw Moore, head in the rafters, standing on his right. Jelaqua was on his left, and the tingling on the scales of Zel’s neck told him the [Rogue], Seborn, was right behind him.</p>
<p>“Hey, not that I don’t like a fight, but if there is one I’d prefer the civilians and kids to be out of the room first, okay?”</p>
<p>Jelaqua smiled at everyone as she put a hand on her belt. She didn’t have her two-handed flail with her, but she had a dagger at her side.</p>
<p>Someone else stepped between Zel and Klbkch. Halrac and Ulrien stood in front of Typhenous and Revi. The two mages looked nervous, but Revi had something in her hands and Typhenous was staring fixedly at Klbkch.</p>
<p>“Halrac and I fought in the Antinium wars.”</p>
<p>Ulrien stared placidly at Klbkch, speaking calmly, but in such a way that it was clear he was ready to do violence. His face was unreadable, but emotion flickered in his tone, out of sight. He glanced at Zel as well.</p>
<p>“I fought against Antinium. But I also fought against Drakes every time their armies came up through Liscor. As far as I’m concerned, you two are welcome to tear each other apart—elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Zel didn’t move. He knew the Gold-rank adventurers had numbers and the drop on him if he moved. But he also knew he didn’t care. And from the way Klbkch was staring at him, the Antinium didn’t care either.</p>
<p>The room was frozen. Selys, staring at the two, bent down to whisper to Lyonette. The girl jerked as Selys touched her and pointed.</p>
<p>“Go over there. If Uncle Zel gets angry, you want to be behind him as far as you can go. If he loses his temper, no one in this room will be able to stop him.”</p>
<p>She whispered a bit too loudly. The Gold-rank adventurers in the room shifted uncomfortably. A Drake [General], a famous one like Zel Shivertail was at least the equivalent of a Named Adventurer.</p>
<p>“Not true.”</p>
<p>It was Xrn of all people who spoke in answer to Selys. The blue Antinium stood up casually, ignoring the way people shifted their attention towards them. She stared at Zel and then at Selys.</p>
<p>“You may not know me, young Drake. But I am Xrn, the Small Queen. Of all those who fought in the Antinium Wars, I was the one who never fell. I am strongest in this room, and so it is I who say: enough.”</p>
<p>She turned to Klbkch.</p>
<p>“Klbkchhezeim. Klbkch the Slayer. You will honor the peace. Or I will halt you myself. As for you, Zel Shivertail…”</p>
<p>She turned to Zel as Klbkch abruptly sat down and folded his arms. Zel stared at Xrn with as much enmity as Klbkch, but the Antinium appeared not to feel his contained fury.</p>
<p>“You are quite different from what I expected. Was it luck or fate that kept us from ever meeting each other on the battlefield during two wars? In any case, I am surprised by you. There is not much of General Sserys in the way you act. He was far more cautious, for all his daring.”</p>
<p>Zel recoiled as if he was struck. The silent room drew in a breath as one. Looking worried, the Gold-rank adventurers stepped away from Zel. There was death in his eyes as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Watch your tongue. Sserys was my mentor. My friend. I haven’t forgotten that you killed him.”</p>
<p>“No. You would not. But did you know, Zel Shivertail? I was there when he died. I spoke to him in the minutes before his death.”</p>
<p>Not a word. Not a breath was drawn. Every eye was on these two. Zel stared at Xrn, and knew that if she spoke the wrong word it would be her head he held next, or his smoking body that lay on the ground. He didn’t care about the consequences. One wrong word.</p>
<p>And it would be war.</p>
<p>“What did you say to him?”</p>
<p>“Many things. Things that I will not utter here. But know that I did not kill him, Zel Shivertail.”</p>
<p>The Drake spat. Xrn shook her head.</p>
<p>“There are others in this room who know I am speaking the truth. I did not kill Sserys. Now. Would you like to know who did?”</p>
<p>Zel’s heart stopped. He stared at Xrn.</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“It was no soldier. No common warrior of the Hives. Of course, you knew that. A single thrust to the heart.”</p>
<p>The Small Queen stared around the room. Her eyes returned to Zel, and her mandibles opened.</p>
<p>“Three Prognugators, three of the <em>original</em> Prognugators survived the war. You named us. Each one. Klbkch the Slayer. I, Xrn. The Small Queen. And the last…”</p>
<p>“Wrymvr. The Deathless.”</p>
<p>Xrn nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“Just so. Ask him what became of Sserys if you are so inclined.”</p>
<p>Something was burning hot in Zel’s chest. He took a step and the room tensed. But he staggered towards the door. Zel pushed it open and disappeared into the snowstorm. He didn’t feel the cold. He didn’t feel anything, but the beating of his heart. He heard the word in his mind, like a pulse thumping in his chest.</p>
<p><em>Wrymvr the Deathless.</em></p>
<p>When he was gone, Xrn turned to the speechless room. She smiled, opening her mandibles as the swirling lights in her eyes lightened and turned bright orange.</p>
<p>“Well, I have done one of the things I have come here to do. Klbkch, we shall speak now. Or perhaps after your presents are opened. Erin Solstice returns.”</p>
<p>All heads turned towards the door. After a few seconds, it was pushed open. Erin walked into the inn, no longer crying. She smiled cheerfully at everyone.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry guys. I don’t know what happened. I can’t apologize enough, but—”</p>
<p>She paused and stared at the overturned table, at the people gathered together, the tense adventurers, and the stunned looks on most of her guests.</p>
<p>“Uh. What happened?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that came presents. It seemed like almost a letdown after all that had passed, but no one had told Erin what had happened and she was determined to salvage the party.</p>
<p>“Here you are, Klbkch! It’s from me!”</p>
<p>The Antinium took the present gingerly, ignoring the stares coming his way. He unwrapped the gift and found…</p>
<p>“A scarf.”</p>
<p>It was black, with splashes of red along the ends. Klbkch stared at the scarf as Erin smiled nervously.</p>
<p>“I had it specially knit. Jasi knows a good [Seamstress], and, well, I thought it would look good on you! I know the Antinium don’t have possessions, but I thought you could wear it now and then…”</p>
<p>Klbkch looked at Erin. Without a word he wound it around his neck. The scarf’s red ends dangled around his shoulders.</p>
<p>“I appreciate it deeply, Erin.”</p>
<p>“Ooh, is that for me? What did I—food!”</p>
<p>Relc goggled at his present. Erin laughed as he lifted out the huge jar of what were to him, strange, round, golden-brown circles.</p>
<p>“They’re cookies! Honey cookies, extra sugary, Relc! Ever since Octavia helped me make baking powder, I’ve been <em>dying</em> to make some!”</p>
<p>“Are they—are they all…?”</p>
<p>“All for you! Go on! Try one!”</p>
<p>Relc did. He bit into the chewy, thick cookie and teared up. He hugged Erin tightly, making her yelp as he scarfed down another cookie.</p>
<p>“They’re so good! So good! So <em>sweet!</em>”</p>
<p>Everyone had presents, and everyone opened them, with the exception of the absent Zel and Xrn, whom Erin hadn’t included on the list. They opened presents, at first awkwardly, but soon getting over the excitement of the last few minutes for a more normal, fun experience.</p>
<p>“A new robe?”</p>
<p>Pisces stared incredulously at Ceria. He held up the pristine white robes, made of strong, soft cotton. She smiled wryly at him.</p>
<p>“Don’t go crying on <em>my</em> shoulder. Erin insisted I get something for you—hold on Ksmvr. Is this for me?”</p>
<p>“I have obtained the present for you, yes, Captain Springwalker.”</p>
<p>Ceria frowned as she opened the present.</p>
<p>“What is—”</p>
<p>She gasped and Pisces’ eyes nearly fell out his head as he stared at the lump of gold. Ceria gaped at the gold nugget and then at Ksmvr. He nodded in satisfaction.</p>
<p>“I was advised to get jewelry for you by Erin Solstice. Gold is a component of jewelry, hence this gift is appropriate. Do you like it?”</p>
<p>“Um. Yes!”</p>
<p>Other presents weren’t as dramatic. Lyonette was explaining to Halrac that the jar of honey and sausage was a gift from Mrsha—the Gnoll had picked out the sausage herself. Brunkr blinked down at the bottle of wine Wesle had given him and the [Actor] introduced himself awkwardly as he clutched the blanket Jasi had bought for him around his shoulders.</p>
<p>Relc had bought a wickedly sharp curved dagger that [Assassins] used for Klbkch. The Antinium had bought him a signed receipt from every tavern owner in the city, promising Relc ten free drinks.</p>
<p>“You guys are so sweet!”</p>
<p>Jelaqua laughed as she accepted her gifts from Seborn and Moore. Respectively they were a powdering kit to make her body look more alive, and an extra-powerful liquid soap bought from Octavia.</p>
<p>When Erin asked what the soap was for, Jelaqua winked at her.</p>
<p>“Helps with cleaning all the parts that get really messy. You know how it is.”</p>
<p>The girl shuddered. But then she laughed, and gave Jelaqua a hug, much to the Selphid’s delight.</p>
<p>It was Christmas. In time, people began looking towards their beds. The adventurers trooped upstairs, and the others bid Erin goodnight.</p>
<p>“They’ll all be heading out tomorrow. But if you want to talk—”</p>
<p>Selys gripped Erin’s hands gently with her claws. Erin didn’t quite meet her eyes as she smiled.</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine, Selys. I’m sorry about—well, merry Christmas.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Have a good one. This was really fun, Erin.”</p>
<p>The others passed by Erin, nodding to her, shaking her hand, hugging her—Klbkch paused as Xrn stood by his side.</p>
<p>“I apologize for causing a commotion in your absence, Erin.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Uh, well, you’re forgiven.”</p>
<p>Erin blinked as he bowed his head and left. She stared as Klbkch walked out into the snow with Xrn.</p>
<p>The two Antinium moved in silence, and then Xrn looked at Klbkch.</p>
<p>“Do you understand what I did in there, Klbkch?”</p>
<p>“I understand, but I do not know <em>why.</em>”</p>
<p>Klbkch stared at Xrn. The Small Queen sighed.</p>
<p>“Had we talked, you would know. But understand this, Klbkch. I did not come here to simply evaluate your Hive’s latest works. There is more at stake here.”</p>
<p>Klbkch hesitated.</p>
<p>“Then it seems we must talk after all. I feared what you might say. Now I do not know what you have come here to tell me.”</p>
<p>“Well then. Let us find out.”</p>
<p>They walked off towards their Hive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back at the inn, Halrac, Revi, Typhenous, and Ulrien stood together in the hallway as Erin bade the last of her guests goodnight, speaking quietly.</p>
<p>“We’ll leave tomorrow, then. Halrac, are you sure this is what you want to do?”</p>
<p>“Ask, Ulrien.”</p>
<p>The [Scout] stood with arms folded. He stared down towards the staircase. He could still hear Erin saying goodbye to Octavia.</p>
<p>“There’s something about her. Just ask your contacts and I’ll ask mine. That’s all I want.”</p>
<p>“Who <em>is</em> that girl?”</p>
<p>Revi stared at her teammates. No one answered. Ulrien yawned, and looked to his room.</p>
<p>“We may find an answer tomorrow. Until then…Merry Christmas.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“I suppose?”</p>
<p>“Merry Christmas to you all.”</p>
<p>Halrac and Revi went to their rooms. Typhenous bade them goodnight. He paused at the doorway, and turned to make sure the corridor was empty. Then he smiled and put a finger to his head. He whispered as he entered his room.</p>
<p>“[Message] spell to Lord Tyrion Veltras. Please record the following message and deliver at once. Yes…I will pay for immediate priority delivery.”</p>
<p>He spoke a short message as he closed the door to his room. No one heard. Or rather, Typhenous <em>thought</em> that no one heard.</p>
<p>Pisces shook his head as he cancelled the [Invisibility] spell and walked silently down the stairs towards the basement. Mages. It was the same in Wistram—despite knowing such powerful magics, even the best mages were so <em>careless.</em> How hard would it have been to put up a [Muffle] spell, or a [Contained Sound] ward? He could just put his ear to the door and listen!</p>
<p>“What the hell were you doing up there?”</p>
<p>Ceria hissed at Pisces as she and the other Horns of Hammerad stood at the door to the basement. Pisces flicked his fingers and the specialized magic only she could read flickered before her eyes.</p>
<p><em>Tell you later. Much is afoot.</em></p>
<p>She stared at him, and then yanked the trapdoor open. Yvlon and Ksmvr went down below.</p>
<p>“Erin? We’re going to sleep. Goodnight.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Goodnight!”</p>
<p>Erin turned and smiled at the Horns of Hammerad. Ceria nodded to her, searching the Human girl’s face. But Erin seemed cheerful, if tired.</p>
<p>The half-Elf and Pisces went down below. Erin turned and saw Lyonette and Mrsha standing on the stairwell.</p>
<p>“Do you need anything else, Erin?”</p>
<p>“No, I think we can clean up tomorrow. You two have a good night. Merry Christmas!”</p>
<p>Mrsha made a small, indistinct, sleepy noise and Lyonette smiled.</p>
<p>“Merry Christmas, Erin.”</p>
<p>And then she went upstairs. Erin stood in the center of her messy room, smiling faintly. She noticed coins on the tables and frowned. Apparently, people still paid her for the party.</p>
<p>She went around from table to table, collecting coins. As she did, Erin mechanically piled up dishes. When she got to the overturned table, she stopped.</p>
<p>Slowly, Erin looked around the dark room. The only light now came from the fireplace. Erin went over to it and stared at the embers. They glowed in the darkness, but dimly. They were fading, without any fuel left to consume.</p>
<p>She looked around again. No one. Erin was sure everyone was asleep by now. So she sat by the fire and stared into the remains.</p>
<p>“I really screwed up, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>Erin said it softly, not wanting to wake anyone. How could she have done that? Broken down in front of everyone? On Christmas?</p>
<p>Her hands trembled. Now that she was alone, really alone, Erin felt her eyes stinging again. She’d ruined Christmas. Even if people were happy now, she’d made them all sad. Because she was sad.</p>
<p>But she <em>was</em> sad! Erin stared at the blurry orange light and wiped at her eyes. Her shoulders began to shake.</p>
<p>Standing at the top of the stairs, Lyonette made not a noise. She stared down into the dark room, at the figure sitting by the fire. She heard the muffled sounds, almost indistinct in the quiet inn. And then Erin’s voice.</p>
<p>She was crying again. When no one could see. Lyonette leaned against the bannister as she heard Erin’s voice.</p>
<p>“I want to go <em>home!</em>”</p>
<p>Erin wept uncontrollably as she sat alone by the dying fire. Hidden in the shadows, Lyonette stared down at Erin. She reached a hand out, and then turned away.</p>
<p>There were tears in Lyonette’s eyes as she went into her and Mrsha’s room, closing the door softly behind her. She stared out her window up at the clear night sky. She cried too. Not for herself, but for Erin. For a girl that wanted to go home.</p>
<p>Her voice was a whisper. Lyonette stared up at the dark sky. There was no one to hear her, but she spoke anyway. She spoke to the world and the stars.</p>
<p>“I, Lyonette du Marquin, swear on my name. I swear by my blood. Someday I will…”</p>
<p>In her inn, Erin curled up on the floor. She kept crying, letting loose all the emotions she’d kept bottled up for so long. She lay on the ground as the day she’d called Christmas ended. The longest night began as Erin slept on the floor of her inn, eyes red, curled up by a dead fire.</p>
<p>The shortest day of the year began as Erin Solstice slept. Her friends stayed in the city, left her to her grief. Erin was alone.</p>
<p>Alone.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The day after Christmas, Ryoka woke up in a quiet village where the houses were still partly submerged by snow. She got up and after eating a communal breakfast with the villagers, began to say her goodbyes.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you won’t stay, Miss Ryoka? There’s hardly a road to follow, and the snow hasn’t stopped falling. We’d be happy to offer you a place to stay as long as is needed.”</p>
<p>Prost indicated one of the excavated houses they’d let Ryoka stay in for the night. Ryoka, thinking of how she’d been the only person to have a room to herself while the others slept four or more to a room, shook her head.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of you to offer, but I have to be going. I can reach Invrisil in a day even with deep snow. I have a…guide.”</p>
<p>“Just as you say, Miss. But I…we…can’t thank you enough for making this delivery on Emperor Laken’s behalf.”</p>
<p>He took Ryoka’s hand in his callused ones and bowed over it. Ryoka hesitated, and then clasped Prost’s hand.</p>
<p>“It was the right thing to do, that’s all. Your [Emperor] is a good man. He was the one who convinced me to make the journey. Thank him as well. But I have to be off. There’s somewhere I need to go back to, and people waiting for me. Perhaps I’ll return in the future.”</p>
<p>“If you do, our doors will always be open to you. Always. We owe you a large debt, Miss Ryoka.”</p>
<p>That promise was repeated by every man and woman Ryoka said farewell to. Every villager wanted to say goodbye to Ryoka personally, and she had to shake their hands, trade hugs…and also bend down to do the same to the children.</p>
<p>“You take it easy, okay?”</p>
<p>Ryoka looked Anabelle in the eyes as the young girl reached out to shake her hand. The child was still holding the doll that Ryoka had given her. She hadn’t let go of it once.</p>
<p>“I will, Miss. Thank you.”</p>
<p>She looked so small, standing in the freshly fallen snow. Ryoka felt old as she stood and put her gloves on. The wind blew and she nearly lost her grip on one.</p>
<p>“It’s cold. You stay warm and indoors, alright? When the snows melt…Laken will return.”</p>
<p>“I know he will. He promised.”</p>
<p>Anabelle smiled. There was such trust in her expression that Ryoka didn’t know what to say. She looked down at the girl and then at the village.</p>
<p>“You all really love him, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“He saved us, Miss Runner. You did, too. Maybe when I gain a class, I’ll be a [Runner].”</p>
<p>Ryoka glanced down and opened her mouth. She hesitated, looking into Anabelle’s eyes. They were alight, not dull and empty like they had been when she’d first seen them. Ryoka bit back what she was about to say, and knelt one last time.</p>
<p>“You know what? You might be a good [Runner]. When spring comes, eat a lot and run around a bit. Just have fun, and…we’ll see. Until then, stay warm.”</p>
<p>She stood, and turned. It was time to go. The villagers who’d gathered around her in the cold stepped back. But one woman came hurrying towards Ryoka, holding a box in her hands.</p>
<p>It was one of the present boxes Ryoka had handed out last night. Only, this one had been rewrapped in a hurry. Ryoka stared at it and then raised her hands.</p>
<p>“Oh no. You didn’t…please, I don’t need anything. I can’t accept—”</p>
<p>“It’s Christmas, isn’t it? And you gave us so much…please, take this.”</p>
<p>The woman, Prost’s wife, Yesel, handed the box to Ryoka. The girl wanted to refuse, but couldn’t. She gingerly unwrapped the gift and blinked down at what was inside.</p>
<p>It was a scarf. Hand-knitted, thick, it was dark grey, but for a band of blue across the center. The scarf had a complex wave-pattern that saw the blue center rise and fall, like a wave. It looked brand new, and as if it had never been used.</p>
<p>Ryoka took the wool scarf out of the box and stared at Yesel. The woman looked at her, looked at the scarf, and Ryoka knew that it had not been meant for her. But she asked no questions.</p>
<p>It was useful, but Ryoka didn’t want to take it. She was on the verge of refusing when she suddenly glanced up and to the left. Yesel stared, but Ryoka only seemed to be staring at a patch of blank air to her. But then the girl looked down at her and tried to force a smile.</p>
<p>“Thank you. I—I guess I would need this, after all.”</p>
<p>“It’s far too cold to be without. And it’s—a good fit. I’d be happier seeing it on you than going to waste.”</p>
<p>Yesel watched as Ryoka wound the scarf around her face and neck. Normally Ryoka wouldn’t have bothered, but her coat didn’t cover her head, and the wind was freezing. Any colder and Ryoka wouldn’t be able to stay outdoors without goggles or some kind of protection to keep her corneas from freezing. She’d heard of that happening and had no desire to find out what that felt like herself.</p>
<p>“Thank you. When I see Lak—your [Emperor], I’ll let him know you’re all well.”</p>
<p>Ryoka said it again as she walked towards the outskirts of the village. The people gathered and waved after her, calling blessings. Ryoka slowly began to jog, and then run out of the village. She didn’t look back once, and soon, she’d left it behind.</p>
<p>When Ryoka was certain she was out of sight, she slowed her pace a bit. She spoke to the air.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe. Why did you tell me to accept the scarf?”</p>
<p>The Frost Faerie flew down out of the air and hovered by Ryoka’s side as the girl ran on through the deep snow. It was flurrying, the snow blowing down and confusing any sense of direction. It would soon be very dark, Ryoka knew. Only Ivolethe’s light shone brightly in this world of frost and snow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Refusing a gift given in good will on the Winter Solstice is ill luck, Ryoka. You should know that.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Ryoka frowned at Ivolethe. She’d forgotten it was the shortest day of the year today. But then, it made sense. Yesterday hadn’t actually been Christmas, just a day that Erin had chosen to be the holiday. And the Winter Solstice…</p>
<p>“Does that mean the winter’s only half-over?”</p>
<p>Ivolethe shook her head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Nay, two thirds. I do not know how such things are reckoned where you hail from, but in this place, we govern winter. And the shortest day of the year marks the beginning of the end. In time, we shall depart. But this day has more significance than just that. That is why I warned you not to scorn the gift of goodwill.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Why? Because it’s unlucky?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka laughed. But Ivolethe’s face remained serious as she flew next to the girl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Do not mock my words. It is the Winter Solstice, Ryoka Griffin. Not Christmas. Not some day of mortal make. There is power in this day, even if it is not celebrated by the races of this world.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The smile on Ryoka’s face faded. She stared at Ivolethe.</p>
<p>“You’re serious. What, is the Winter Solstice really an important day here?”</p>
<p>The Frost Faerie nodded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Today is a day of power. It is the shortest day of the year—a moment when spirits and magic mix and mingle with the mortal plane. Surely you know of this?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I—not really. You’re telling me magic is stronger on this day?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Perhaps. Perhaps not. I would not know, since magic is practiced differently by the people of this world. But other things take on different aspects on this day.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Hold up.”</p>
<p>Ryoka slowed down and stopped in the deep snow. She brushed some snowflakes away from her face and stared at Ivolethe.</p>
<p>“Are you telling me that days like the Winter Solstice, the equinoxes, things like the witching hour…are all actual times of power?”</p>
<p>The Frost Faerie flew closer to Ryoka’s face. There was not a twitch, not a single tell that she was lying or playing games. She looked as serious as Ryoka had ever seen her, and that bothered the young woman greatly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Time has power, as does place. I say again, be cautious today, Ryoka Griffin. Since you travel, it would be best if you enter no house uninvited nor ask for any favors of those you meet upon the road. Utter no curses, ask for no blessings if ye are unwilling to pay the price. And make no bargains, make no promises. Tell no lies.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka stared at Ivolethe. Her humor faded, and she felt just the tiniest bit uneasy.</p>
<p>“I will. But if today’s so important—no, dangerous—would it have been better to stay indoors?”</p>
<p>The faerie shook her head. She cast her eyes upwards at the dark sky and the falling snow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Indoors? Hah. On such a day, only a leyline or—nae, a sacred spot would attract attention. Fate will find you no matter where you go, Ryoka. Best to be about your business. But let us hurry on. It will be dark soon, and you should be behind stone and iron before the night is deepest.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She flew ahead, lighting Ryoka’s path. The girl ran after her. On the shortest day of the year, she followed the Frost Faerie onwards. But soon, both Ryoka and Ivolethe were lost. And dusk came quickly, so that when Erin woke, in the blink of an eye it seemed almost like night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Erin Solstice woke up late in the day for once. But when she sat up, letting the blanket fall off her shoulders by the smoldering fireplace, she thought she was dreaming.</p>
<p>It was already dusk, and her inn was empty. Erin stared at the blanket someone had wrapped around her, and then looked around her inn. But from the basement to the second floor, there was not a soul to be found.</p>
<p>Even Lyonette’s bee grub was gone. Her inn was deserted. No one was here, but Erin.</p>
<p>The girl walked about, feeling a wave of loneliness pass over her. It was the same feeling as yesterday. As every day, really.</p>
<p>She was alone. Only now she didn’t have anything to keep her busy.</p>
<p>Erin didn’t eat. She went over to the fireplace and sat in front of it, staring into the embers. Someone had added fuel to the fire, but it had burnt low again by the time Erin had woke up.</p>
<p>The girl stared into the fading coals, and then reached for a piece of wood. She slowly placed the log onto the fire, and watched the wood smoulder and then begin to ignite. She put a second piece of wood next to the first, and the fire grew. It reached up to consume the logs, and the wood burned.</p>
<p>The room began to warm. Erin huddled in front of the fire, warming herself. She stared into the heart of the flames and felt the inn echo around her. Vast. Empty.</p>
<p>On the hill, her inn stood, windows shuttered, door closed. It was the one building around. The city lay a small ways off, no doubt full of life. And beyond that, a few villages filled the hilltops before the snowy floodplains gave way to higher ground. Past that was the city of Esthelm, and other lands.</p>
<p>But here, on this isolated hilltop, the inn was the only source of light and life, however faint it may be. And in that inn, a young woman held her hands to the fire. She added more wood, and the modest blaze became a large conflagration, burning bright and fierce.</p>
<p>It was a waste of firewood for one person. But Erin didn’t care. She stoked the fire, feeding it, making it large enough to warm her cold heart and tired body. And the fire grew, and the inn warmed and gained new life.</p>
<p>So Erin sat, warming herself and thinking of nothing in front of the fire. She would have sat there until she slept, but then she heard a sound. She turned, and realized she had visitors.</p>
<p>Three.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They were lost. Ryoka didn’t realize it at first. She followed Ivolethe, never doubting the faerie…until she found herself running past a fallen tree that looked too familiar to ignore.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe!”</p>
<p>Ryoka pulled down the scarf around her face, grimacing and wiping at the moisture built up on her lips and nose by her breath. Snow blew past her as Ryoka covered her face with one arm, shielding it from the worst of the blizzard. It felt just as bad—no, worse—than yesterday.</p>
<p>“<em>Ivolethe!</em> Where the hell are we!? I could have sworn we passed that same tree a minute ago!”</p>
<p>She had to look hard to see the Frost Faerie’s glow as Ivolethe flew back towards her. Ivolethe was frowning as she stared at the fallen tree Ryoka pointed to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“It is not the same tree. Your eyes play tricks on you, Ryoka Griffin.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You sure?”</p>
<p>Ryoka peered at the tree. She hadn’t paid much attention to it, but she felt it was lying in the same place and at the same angle as the last one she’d seen. How many fallen trees were there, anyways?</p>
<p>“Where are we going, Ivolethe? I thought we were following the road!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“We are!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What do you call <em>this,</em> then?”</p>
<p>Ryoka waved her hand at the grove of trees that she and the Frost Faerie were travelling through. It was a forest of some kind, and not one Ryoka remembered going through on the way to Riverfarm.</p>
<p>Ivolethe looked uncertain. She cast about and flew upwards, fighting the strong winds that threatened to blow her away. When she flew back down to Ryoka, she pointed past the tree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“This is the way to the road.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The young woman peered doubtfully in the direction Ivolethe had indicated.</p>
<p>“You sure?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Yes! Now come!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe scowled, unused to being questioned. She flew off angrily and Ryoka cursed and ran to catch up, wrapping her scarf around her head as she did.</p>
<p>“Don’t go so fast, Ivolethe! I can barely see you in all of this! Can’t you make your light red again?”</p>
<p>The faerie didn’t answer, or maybe she didn’t hear Ryoka. The girl ran on, tripping over buried tree roots and cursing as she passed through a spot with low-hanging branches. But then she saw the faint light of Ivolethe’s aura pause. Ryoka caught up to the faerie and halted.</p>
<p>“What the…”</p>
<p>They were back at the fallen tree. Only this time, they were facing it from an entirely different angle. Ryoka turned back and stared the way they’d come. Then she looked angrily at Ivolethe.</p>
<p>“What the hell is this, Ivolethe? Are you messing with me?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I’m not!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The faerie protested as Ryoka glared at her. She stared at the fallen tree, her brows furrowed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I…must have turned the wrong way. But I will take you to the road. It’s this way.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She pointed in a completely different direction than the way she had before. Ryoka stared at Ivolethe, frowning with vexation.</p>
<p>“If you’re playing games, Ivolethe, I’m not in the mood. I’m cold—it’s getting dark, and—”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Cease your complaints! I know the way. Follow me and be silent!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The faerie snapped at Ryoka and flew off. Surprised by the faerie’s outburst—Ivolethe sounded truly angry—Ryoka followed the faerie. But after a few minutes of running she realized something was wrong.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe. <em>Ivolethe!</em>”</p>
<p>The faerie paused and glared back at Ryoka.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“What?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You’re going the wrong way! You just turned left, towards the way we came!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I did not!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You did. I saw you! Look—you can see the fallen tree back that way!”</p>
<p>Ryoka pointed, and Ivolethe stared incredulously. It was true. She was headed straight back towards the fallen tree again.</p>
<p>About to make an acidic comment, Ryoka paused as she stared at the Frost Faerie. She’d assumed Ivolethe was playing a prank on her, but the surprise and uncertainty she saw on the tiny faerie’s face bothered her.</p>
<p>“What’s going on, Ivolethe? Why are we going in circles?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I…do not know. Hold. I will see where we are. Just wait—”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe cast about, and then flew up. Ryoka saw her form flying straight up, and then getting dragged to the left by the wind.</p>
<p>“By the wind…? I thought Ivolethe could read the wind. Or control it.”</p>
<p>Ryoka muttered to herself as she saw Ivolethe fighting to stay in one place. The faerie flew higher, until her light was swallowed up by the darkness. Ryoka waited on the ground for a minute. And then five.</p>
<p>And then ten. Ryoka stared upwards, shivering, calling out.</p>
<p>“<em>Ivolethe! </em>Are you there? Answer me!”</p>
<p>But no response came. Ryoka paced back and forth anxiously. After what felt like forever, she saw the faintest of lights in the darkening skies. Ivolethe flew down out of the sky, shouting Ryoka’s name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Ryoka! Ryoka Griffin! Hear my call! Where art thou?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Here! Ivolethe, I’m here!”</p>
<p>Ryoka shouted and waved her arms. The Frost Faerie flew towards her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Where did ye go? I lost you!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I didn’t go anywhere! You went straight up and vanished!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“No! I flew up and when I looked back to find you, you were gone!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two stared at each other, searching for a hint of deception in each other’s expressions. But neither was lying. After a second, Ryoka stared around at the scattered trees and dark landscape.</p>
<p>“What’s going on, Ivolethe? I’m being serious, now. I don’t like what’s happening.”</p>
<p>The faerie looked grave. She flew closer to Ryoka and placed a hand on her small chest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Upon my name, Ryoka Griffin, I do not know. I am not lying to ye. Something is afoot and I cannot tell what.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Could it be…could it be your sisters, Ivolethe? I didn’t see them when I woke up—is this some prank of theirs? Or someone else…of your kind?”</p>
<p>Ivolethe frowned and looked about. Then she shook her head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I would be able to tell if it were a working of my people. Besides, the magic of the fae is mine. I see through all glamours, and can walk through the twisted halls of my land without losing my way. The magic of the <em>Sidhe </em>cannot fool my eyes, any more than a spell of mortal make can. No, this is something else. Something…else.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That bothered Ryoka greatly. She stared about once more, noting how the sun, still completely hidden behind the clouds, was almost gone. She recalled what Ivolethe had said about the Winter Solstice. A time of power. An important event.</p>
<p>“Look, did you see the road? Can we follow that?”</p>
<p>The faerie looked at Ryoka and slowly shook her head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I saw no road, Ryoka.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“But we just left—”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I saw no road. Nor any landmarks I recognized. Just trees and snow and darkness.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka paused. She felt the wind blow harder, and the chill cut into her flesh. But there was another chill in her bones.</p>
<p>“In that case…we’re lost. And it’s cold. I know you might not feel it, Ivolethe, but if I have to spend the night…I need a fire.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I know. And it seems we cannot leave this place yet. Build a fire, Ryoka Griffin, and quickly. Build it high and mighty. I will help.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The faerie flew past Ryoka, and both girl and fae ran back towards the fallen tree. It was cold, hard as rock, and partially covered by the snow, but it was a good place to start.</p>
<p>Finding a spot that was at least partially protected from the wind, Ryoka set to work trying to build a fire. She used the fallen tree as protection from the wind, and scraped away snow and ice to get to the wet earth below.</p>
<p>There was no hope of building a snow cave out here, despite the deep snow. It was all powder, and Ryoka felt like if she tried to pack it into a buildable substance she’d be working all night. She’d have to dig a trench. At least if she used the tree, she could count on sheltering herself from a good portion of the wind chill.</p>
<p>But first, the fire. Ryoka knew she was very lucky to have burnable, dead wood around her. She took out the knife at her belt that she’d seldom used but always carried, and began hacking at the dead branches of the fallen tree.</p>
<p>She needed dry, burnable fuel to start with. Ivolethe flew out of the storm and dropped more dead wood for the young woman as she stripped bark and the outer layer of frozen wood away, searching for dry wood pulp.</p>
<p>It took Ryoka a long time to set the fire up even when she had enough wood. She didn’t know any fire spells, and the flint and steel she carried were <em>not</em> as handy as a ziplocked bag of dry matches. Or a can of petroleum.</p>
<p>“Can’t you unfreeze part of this place? I know you did it once—you have spring powers, right?”</p>
<p>Ryoka shouted at Ivolethe in frustration after her eighth failed attempt to get the tinder to light. The Frost Faerie shook her head as she hovered a few feet away from Ryoka’s attempt at a fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I have such aspects, but it is not wise to use them without dire cause, Ryoka. And even then…nae. Not here.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She looked around warily at the dark forest. Ryoka paused and stared at Ivolethe. The Frost Faerie stared back. Her expression told Ryoka more than she wanted to know. It was uncertain, and more than that…Ryoka had never seen a faerie looking uneasy.</p>
<p>The girl bent over the wood and redoubled her efforts to get it to light. At last, after Ryoka’s hands were cramping up from striking so many sparks, one caught. Ryoka immediately sheltered the fire, letting it grow, desperately helping Ivolethe feed it bits of tinder.</p>
<p>And after what seemed like hours of work, there was a fire. Ryoka sat back, gasping with relief as it grew and she fed it more wood, letting it warm her and the wet firewood she’d placed around it.</p>
<p>“Thank god. Thank…jeeze.”</p>
<p>Ivolethe flew around the fire, dropping bits of dry wood into it. She stared at the blaze, and then around at the forest. It was very dark, now. The sky had faded to pitch blackness faster than Ryoka could ever remember seeing, except maybe in a country like Poland, where sunlight might only last for three hours each day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“The fire is growing. Good. Keep it burning bright, Ryoka. Do not let it go out.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You don’t have to tell me twice.”</p>
<p>Ryoka shuddered, feeling herself warm up. But it wasn’t the need for heat that seemed to bother the faerie. She kept looking around the fire, into the dark forest. Ryoka stared around too. And then she felt a prickling sensation down her back.</p>
<p>She didn’t know why, but it felt like they were not alone in the forest. Perhaps it was Ivolethe’s wariness, but suddenly Ryoka thought she was being watched. She stared about surreptitiously, one hand on the knife she’d used to cut the wood. She had potions—some of them were too frozen to use, but Ryoka could warm them at the fire. The girl cursed as she suddenly realized she could have used the ignition potion for the flour bomb that Octavia had given her to light the fire!</p>
<p>But…perhaps it was best she hadn’t used it. Ryoka stared about. It was cold, and she could only hear the blowing wind. But she felt it now, the same as Ivolethe.</p>
<p>Something was out there. And it was watching her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They were three. They stood in her inn, the closed door behind them. Erin hadn’t heard them come in. She turned, caught off-guard, but the three didn’t seem like they meant to harm her.</p>
<p>“My apologies, Miss Innkeeper. We do not mean to intrude, but the storm outside pushed us in. We come bearing no ill will. May we seek the hospitality of your hearth on this dark day?”</p>
<p>The first who spoke was a man who stood taller than any man that Erin had ever seen. He was not a giant or <em>stretched</em>, like a basketball player was, though. He simply stood as if he looked down upon everyone and everything.</p>
<p>He had a beard, and a face that reminded Erin of Abraham Lincoln. Perhaps it was just the way his features looked? His nose? No—there was just something timeless about his appearance, Erin decided. Like Teddy Roosevelt, someone who defined his time, who stood out.</p>
<p>He had a beard. And an air about him that made Erin forget his companions for a second. But then she saw a man standing next to him, tall, taller than the first, actually, but who didn’t have his presence. He was slightly hunched, and thin. He looked like a librarian, or a scholar, or what such people were supposed to look like.</p>
<p>He held a book in his hands. It was faded and worn and looked as though it were ancient. But Erin’s eyes passed from him to her third guest, because the last man who stood in her inn didn’t strike her as a man at all, at first.</p>
<p>He…it was a he, Erin thought, was not beautiful or handsome. That was surprising, because Erin felt he <em>should</em> have been. But he simply looked like someone Erin vaguely recognized, as if he had the features of someone Erin had known. But she had never met him before, she was certain.</p>
<p>And he looked like a guy. Now Erin was uncertain of why she’d ever thought he was she. Perhaps it was the way he moved. He was graceful in the way the other two weren’t.</p>
<p>There they stood, the three of them. Erin stared at them in confusion, and then smiled.</p>
<p>“Um. Hello. Welcome. I’m sorry. I didn’t hear you come in. Please…welcome.”</p>
<p>The three bowed their heads, almost as one. Erin walked towards them, feeling lightheaded. She hadn’t eaten.</p>
<p>“You look like travelers. Are you lost?”</p>
<p>“Not lost, Miss. Simply weary. I thank you for allowing us to enter your inn.”</p>
<p>The tall, thin man with the book smiled down at Erin. She smiled back, staring into eyes paler than the moon, but deeper than any ocean.</p>
<p>“My door is always open, especially to people who need food and rest. Can I…can I get you something to eat?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The three spoke almost as one. The man who walked like a dancer bowed to Erin, smiling broadly.</p>
<p>“It has been a long time since we ate anything. Whatever you offer, we will gladly partake.”</p>
<p>“Just a second then. I’ll get what I have!”</p>
<p>Erin rushed into the kitchen. She wasn’t sure what she pulled out, but it felt like she was searching for food, frying and cooking at the same time, and then bringing the dishes out to the three men all at once. How much time had passed? A second? Hours?</p>
<p>“A feast!”</p>
<p>The man with the beard declared that as Erin filled the table for them. He and the other two men began to eat, not without manners, but in a way that told Erin they were starved.</p>
<p>“Can I get you anything else?”</p>
<p>She wanted to keep serving them food, famished as they seemed. But to her surprise, the man with the beard bade her sit.</p>
<p>“Come. Eat with us, our generous host. ‘Tis been far too long since we passed the time with anyone else.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“We insist.”</p>
<p>The other two beckoned Erin over as well. So she sat, and began to eat with them. And until that moment, Erin hadn’t realized how hungry she was herself. In moments she was scarfing down the food with the three.</p>
<p>And then…how strange it was. Erin felt like her guests were no more strangers to her than any of her regular customers. She sat and ate and laughed with them as if she’d known them her entire lives. They were familiar, in a way Erin couldn’t name.</p>
<p>When it was over, again, as if in the blink of an eye, Erin sat with the other three around the fire, warming herself. The three men complimented her on her food as she demurred. Then the one with the book sighed as he stared at the sliver of night through one of Erin’s shuttered windows.</p>
<p>“It is dark and cold outside. I fear our companions face the storm alone at this moment.”</p>
<p>“Oh no. Are they lost too? Should we go get them?”</p>
<p>Erin started for the door.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>The man with the beard stopped Erin.</p>
<p>“It would not do to venture out in such a storm at the moment. Things lurk in the shadows. They wait. Better to stay indoors.”</p>
<p>“But your friends…”</p>
<p>He shook his head, and the other two did likewise, making the same motion at the exact same time.</p>
<p>“They are lost as we are, but do not fear. We will meet again in time. That is a certainty, and they do not fear the storm.”</p>
<p>“If you’re sure—what are their names? I can put up posters, ask about…”</p>
<p>The three men laughed as if Erin had said something hilarious. The man with the beard shook his head again.</p>
<p>“Do not worry. They will come in time. As for names…it would be pointless to ask. Few remember my name, let alone the others.”</p>
<p>“Your name? I’m sorry, you never said. What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Some call me Tamaroth, little innkeeper. But how are you called?”</p>
<p>Erin realized she’d never introduced herself, even after all this time! She blushed; sitting with them had felt so natural she hadn’t thought of it.</p>
<p>“I’m Erin Solstice.”</p>
<p>They sighed, hearing it. As if her name were special. The three men stood around Erin, and she didn’t know when they moved. When the next person spoke, it was the graceful man.</p>
<p>“Well then. You have fed us and given us the hospitality of your home. For that, we are thankful. And so we have three things to offer you, Erin Solstice. Three gifts.”</p>
<p>“Gifts? For me—I couldn’t. I—”</p>
<p>“We insist. Three gifts, but you may only accept one from us. And in return, on this day, the solstice for which you are named…we would ask only one thing in return.”</p>
<p>“What? A gift for a gift? Well, okay, but what is it? I don’t have much to give…”</p>
<p>She had coin and food, but she didn’t feel these men needed either. But they wanted something of her. She didn’t know what, but she knew she had it. The three drew closer, smiling.</p>
<p>“You have it right here. All we ask is it for one of our gifts. It is a small thing. Will you give it?”</p>
<p>“What is it I have?”</p>
<p>They told her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fire was warm. Ryoka stared into it, and then into the night. By her side, Ivolethe looked around darkly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I do not trust this storm, Ryoka. It is…strange. Even to me. I did not predict its coming, and I cannot see what lies in the darkness. Do not stray from the fire.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She didn’t need to tell Ryoka twice. In the wilderness, the blackness around the fire that Ryoka had built was absolute. Just a few feet away from the fire, Ryoka was sure she’d lose her way instantly. She was glad she’d piled up enough wood to last the night; she didn’t want to move anywhere.</p>
<p>Ryoka glanced into the darkness and shuddered. She couldn’t see the trees anymore. That was how black it was. Pitch black wasn’t close to this level of…oblivion. She shuddered and glanced back towards the fire—</p>
<p>And there they were. Three people, sitting around the fire with Ryoka. They had made no sound, and Ryoka had not seen them move. But there they were.</p>
<p>“<em>What the—</em>”</p>
<p>She scrambled backwards. Ivolethe looked and cried out in astonishment. But the three sat, calmly, hands stretched out to the fire. Three.</p>
<p>One was a woman not much older than Ryoka. She looked scarred, liked a warrior. She turned her face to Ryoka, and the girl saw her smile.</p>
<p>The second was an old woman. She sat with gnarled hands outstretched, greedily staring into the flames. When she looked at Ryoka, it was with a gentle expression, like a grandmother staring at a child.</p>
<p>And the third? The third was not—Ryoka tried to stare at it. Her eyes moved away. It was not—</p>
<p>It was not anything Ryoka could describe. It sat. But sat wasn’t the right word. It was rigid, in a way bodies and…flesh was not. But it was there, too. It sat at the fire, warming itself or letting itself be warmed.</p>
<p>And it too looked at Ryoka. She felt its gaze upon her.</p>
<p>“Who are you? How the hell did you get here?”</p>
<p>Ryoka’s voice shook as she stood, staring at her three guests. They looked at her as Ivolethe clung to Ryoka’s clothing. It was the young woman who spoke first.</p>
<p>“We are cold, and came out of the storm to seek shelter. Would you begrudge us the fire, young traveler?”</p>
<p>The old woman was next. She edged closer to the fire, eyes fixed on Ryoka the entire time.</p>
<p>“We ask for your hospitality and grace in the storm. Will you give it to us, oh lost child?”</p>
<p>The third said nothing, but Ryoka knew it asked the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Say no. Turn them away.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe whispered in Ryoka’s ear. But the girl hesitated. She stared at the three. They looked so cold. Colder than ice, as if they’d been caught in the storm without protection for…</p>
<p>“I—I suppose so.”</p>
<p>The faerie made a sound, but the three at the fire smiled so broadly that Ryoka relaxed her guard. The old woman beckoned Ryoka back.</p>
<p>“A blessing upon you. Come, sit. Share the fire you have built with us. The darkness is deep, and it would not do to let the fire go out.”</p>
<p>There was truth in that. Ryoka sat back down, away from the other three, and cautiously fed the fire another piece of wood. The three watched as the flames consumed the stick.</p>
<p>“How…did you get here? I didn’t hear anyone arrive.”</p>
<p>“We have been here all along. Perhaps it is you who never looked.”</p>
<p>This came from the young woman. Ryoka glared at her, but she stared back with amusement in her eyes, not the least bit deterred by Ryoka’s look.</p>
<p>“Okay. Then who are you? Where do you come from?”</p>
<p>“That is a long story. We can tell it, but perhaps…young woman, would you offer me your hand? I wish to sit next to you and it is cold.”</p>
<p>The old woman stretched out her hand towards Ryoka. The girl hesitated. She didn’t want to sit next to the old woman, but she looked <em>cold…</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Do not do it! Let us be away, Ryoka!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A voice in her ear. Ryoka hesitated, and then looked at Ivolethe. The old woman frowned at the tiny faerie on Ryoka’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“What is that you have with you, child? It is a thing of ice and dreams. Not good company for the fire.”</p>
<p>“Her? She’s just…Ivolethe. Don’t mind her.”</p>
<p>“She should leave.”</p>
<p>The young woman with the scars said that. And the thing…agreed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“I will not leave! You leave! Trespassers!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The faerie <em>hissed</em> at them, her eyes narrowed as she clung to Ryoka’s coat. The three stared at Ivolethe and she made another sound, so guttural and wild that Ryoka couldn’t believe it came from Ivolethe.</p>
<p>But then the three looked away from the faerie and back towards Ryoka. It was the young woman with the scars who spoke next.</p>
<p>“Take my hand, then. I see the makings of a warrior on you, traveler. I see bloodshed in your past, and in your future. Take my hand and I will show you what I know of battle and triumph. Of loss and defeat.”</p>
<p>She reached out towards Ryoka. The girl hesitated. She wanted to take the hand, if only because there was something in the young woman’s eyes that called out to her.</p>
<p>Ivolethe pulled at Ryoka’s ear. The girl yelped and swatted at Ivolethe, but the faerie only fluttered away. She sighed.</p>
<p>“I’m no warrior. Sorry. And I don’t like killing or…battle.”</p>
<p>“A shame.”</p>
<p>The hand was withdrawn. Now Ryoka’s eyes fell on the third thing sitting around her fire. It did not move. It did not reach for Ryoka, but she felt the urge to reach for it.</p>
<p>“Ah, perhaps you want to know who our companion is.”</p>
<p>The old woman chuckled, a dry, quiet sound swallowed up by the snow.</p>
<p>“Well, it asks for you to reach out, child. Can you feel it? Can you hear?”</p>
<p>Ryoka…could hear, despite Ivolethe shouting something in her ears. She understood. The thing wanted her to touch it, to…to feel what it felt. To be with it. To know.</p>
<p>Her eyes slid away from what it was. Rigid? It was nothing she could describe. But she knew it was not like the other two. Not…a being. And not a thing. Yet she <em>wanted</em> to touch it. That was what frightened Ryoka the most.</p>
<p>She reached out. She couldn’t help herself. Part of Ryoka wanted to know what it was, so badly. She wanted to touch it—</p>
<p>Ivolethe <em>bit</em> her. Ryoka howled as she clapped a hand to her neck. She felt blood at the tips of her numb fingers and flung the Frost Faerie away.</p>
<p>“Ivolethe!”</p>
<p>The three who sat at her fire stared as the faerie flew back towards Ryoka, blood dribbling down the faerie’s chin. Ivolethe wanted to land on Ryoka’s shoulder again, but the girl wouldn’t let her.</p>
<p>“Now here is a thing that need not be here.”</p>
<p>Ivolethe screamed something like a curse at the young woman sitting across the fire. It made Ryoka’s ears ring, but the young woman simply frowned at the Frost Faerie.</p>
<p>“Begone, thing of ice and cold.”</p>
<p>The flames <em>flickered</em> as the wind blew. Ivolethe shouted, but the gust of wind blew her away. Ryoka turned and saw Ivolethe’s pale blue light flying backwards, her wings beating helplessly. Ivolethe was blown into the darkness outside of the fire. And she did not return.</p>
<p>“There. Much better.”</p>
<p>“Ivolethe!”</p>
<p>Ryoka was on her feet. She started away from the fire, but stopped as she saw the vast darkness lurking beyond. If she went out, Ryoka knew she would never find her way back. It was too dark.</p>
<p>“Do not worry about that thing. Come back, sit with us. The fire is growing low.”</p>
<p>Ryoka turned. It was true. The fire was dying, though it felt like she had just fed it moments ago. The girl stepped back towards the fire, but hesitated.</p>
<p>Why were the three here? How had they…she blinked and frowned. Her head felt cloudy, and she was tired. And cold. She couldn’t think straight, but the three seemed oddly comforting to her. She took a step forwards, hesitating as she narrowed her eyes. They were so <em>familiar.</em></p>
<p>“Do I…know you?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>The young woman looked amused. She shifted, exposing scars on her arms and the side of her face. She smiled at Ryoka as if they were old friends.</p>
<p>“We know each other, even if you do not remember. But sit. Sit, and join us.”</p>
<p>“Yes, join us. Stoke the fire, and sit with us.”</p>
<p>The other two echoed her words. Ryoka hesitated, and drew nearer to the fire. It <em>was</em> growing low. The old woman stretched her hand out to Ryoka, staring her in the eye.</p>
<p>“I offer again. Hold my hand, child. Be free of your worries with me.”</p>
<p>She held her hand out to Ryoka through the flames. It was a hand that promised Ryoka relief. A place to sit, somewhere to rest…Ryoka hesitated.</p>
<p>The young woman was next. Her hand was strong and stretched out to Ryoka, scars shining in the fading firelight.</p>
<p>“Grasp your hand to mine, Ryoka Griffin. Fight, and walk with me through a thousand lands.”</p>
<p>Ryoka stared into the young woman’s eyes and saw the same promise reflected there. To struggle, to <em>fight—</em></p>
<p>She nearly took it, but the third thing sitting at her fire made an offer. And it called to Ryoka without words. It told her to come over, to sit with it, to…know. To find what was missing, to find what never was.</p>
<p>It was there, telling Ryoka to <em>touch</em> it. To let go. To be…</p>
<p>Ryoka took a step towards the fire, and then another. The three waited for her to make her choice. And Ryoka would take one of the hands. Why not? Only…</p>
<p>Something was running down her neck. Absently, Ryoka reached up and touched something wet and warm.</p>
<p>Blood. Her blood. She stared at her fingers and saw the dark liquid on her fingertips. Why? Oh. Right. Ivolethe had bit her.</p>
<p>And seeing her blood triggered something in Ryoka’s head. She frowned as she chased after a thought. Her mind felt foggy, as if she were in a trace, or sleepwalking. But there was something…what was it?</p>
<p>Oh. Yes. Ryoka stared at the three sitting at the fire. She had to ask. It felt so obvious that Ryoka was almost ashamed, but she had to ask. It was important.</p>
<p>“Hey. Why could <em>you</em> see Ivolethe?”</p>
<p>They stared at her. The old woman sighed. The young woman sighed. And the third thing made no sound at all.</p>
<p>“Ah, it is too late. Look, child. The flames have gone out.”</p>
<p>Ryoka saw the old woman’s hand point. She saw a tendril of fire licking at the edge of a stick that was burnt to ash and then—</p>
<p>The fire went out.</p>
<p>The light vanished from the world. There was only the faintest glow, of near-dead embers. Suddenly, the darkness was all around Ryoka, pressing in. Reaching for her. She shuddered and stumbled towards the campfire. She had to ignite it again. She couldn’t be in the darkness.</p>
<p>There were…things out here.</p>
<p>But Ryoka halted. Her feet refused to move as, by the faintest glow of the campfire, she saw who really sat there. Who she’d been talking to this entire time.</p>
<p>There were no people sitting with her. They had never been there. As the light went out, their true forms were revealed.</p>
<p>Dead things sat around the fire. They were dead. But it was far worse than a corpse. Because they were dead but still moving.</p>
<p>Two faces and a…<em>thing</em> stared at Ryoka around the smoking remains of the light. One reached out to her and Ryoka recoiled. The hand that stretched out was not living, but decayed skin, rotting flesh. Bone.</p>
<p>The things were dead. They were rotting and stank of it. They stared at Ryoka, and she stared at them.</p>
<p>It was dark. The darkness was closing in. The embers were fading, and Ryoka could sense things around her. Things not seen, but terrible. Far worse than the thing that sat next to the fire.</p>
<p>She had to have light. But Ryoka refused to go near the fire. She refused to touch the rotting things. But she needed light.</p>
<p>“Magic.”</p>
<p>The word was a whisper in her dry throat. But—yes, that was right! Magic! Magic could save her. Ryoka raised her hands. She called out.</p>
<p>“[Light]. <em>[Light]!</em>”</p>
<p>Nothing happened. Ryoka stared at her hands. She couldn’t feel the magic in her, couldn’t reach into that wellspring inside her soul and draw it out. It was as if there was nothing there.</p>
<p>“There is no magic here. Only the fire.”</p>
<p>The voice that came from the thing that had been the young woman was rasping, dead. As rotten as the body that formed the words. It gestured to the fire.</p>
<p>“Light it, traveler.”</p>
<p>“Yes, light it. Or the darkness and the storm will take us all. You can feel it, can’t you? They are closing in. They are coming.”</p>
<p>Yes, Ryoka could feel it. She could feel things <em>watching</em> her. Drawing closer. The fire was fading. When it was out completely, they would come. They feared the light. But they wanted her.</p>
<p>Hands reached for her across the fire. Dead things spoke. One looked at her and it knew her name.</p>
<p>“Choose, Ryoka Griffin. Let the fire die and we shall all face the darkness. Or come and sit with us.”</p>
<p>The second hand reached out. It still beckoned. Still promised. But the thing that held it was dead.</p>
<p>“Choose.”</p>
<p>And the last thing sat, true form revealed. Ryoka stared at it and knew where it had come from. From beyond the edge of the world. From the places not meant to be looked into. It told her to reach out and enter those places.</p>
<p>She wanted to touch it. She feared to touch it. She did not want to go near the rotting things. But the darkness was closing in. She had no choice. Ryoka had to…</p>
<p><em>Choose.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>—-</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They stood around Erin, holding their gifts. She stared at them, part of her unsure of what was happening. The other part…knew.</p>
<p>All they wanted was a small thing. So small, and yet so precious. It was all Erin had. All anyone had, really. But this was hers.</p>
<p>“What do you want? I mean…what do you want to trade for it? It’s very special to me.”</p>
<p>They nodded. It was special. The three spoke, almost as one. Telling her what they would give her in exchange for it.</p>
<p>Her soul.</p>
<p>The first was the man with the beard.</p>
<p>“I offer an umbrella made from the sun’s light. To bring day into blackest night.”</p>
<p>He handed Erin an umbrella. She took it, and opened it. Sunlight, pure sunlight, the kind Erin had never truly seen, streamed down from under the umbrella’s canopy. She lifted it over her head, and laughed as the sunlight shone around her. For a second, she was warm and she stood in the daylight. So long as Erin held the umbrella open, it would always be bright around her. The light would burn away her fears, burn away untruths and falsehoods. Then she closed the umbrella and the world was dark.</p>
<p>The second was the man with the book.</p>
<p>“I have here a hangman’s rope. For those who live without any hope.”</p>
<p>He handed Erin a long, thick rope with a noose on the end. Erin tossed the end over one of the beams in the rafters and the others helped her tie it securely. She stood on a table, and put her head in the noose. Then she stepped off the table and hung there.</p>
<p>She was dead. Erin hung in her inn, dead. Minutes passed, then hours. Days. Years. When she took the rope off her neck, Erin smiled. No one had known she was alive. They all thought she was dead. While she hung there, no enemy would find her. It was perfect. She let the noose hang over her head as she turned.</p>
<p>The third, the man who danced as he walked.</p>
<p>“I hold a horn made of ancient bone. A thing to protect both hearth and home.”</p>
<p>He handed Erin a horn of pure white bone. It was cold to the touch, but when she put it to her lips and blew, the call echoed through her inn. It was a call that rose above the loudest horns of the battlefield, which travelled the world. Erin knew that in any part of the world, her friends would hear her call. She lowered the horn as the call echoed.</p>
<p>So. There they were. An umbrella that was as bright as the sun. It could chase away all darkness, reveal all lies. No magic could stand against it, and it warmed the skin and brought light. And the second, a noose. So Erin could kill herself and hide from her enemies. She could live in peace so long as she hung from it. And the third, a horn to call her allies and those she loved from wherever she stood.</p>
<p>Three gifts. Each one priceless. Erin stared at the offerings. She stared at the men.</p>
<p>“And all you want is a soul for it?”</p>
<p>They nodded. The three stared at her, waiting. Erin wavered. She stared at the umbrella, the noose, and then the horn. They were so precious. She wanted each one, each for a different reason. And the price was so simple. So small. She had a soul. It was hers to give. Why not trade it? Why not give it?</p>
<p>Her hand wavered as she reached out—</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>—-</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>“Did you hear that?”</p>
<p>The young woman looked up, heart beating wildly as she stared around the darkness. The three sitting at the fire looked up.</p>
<p>“I hear nothing.”</p>
<p>“I see nothing.”</p>
<p>“But I heard it. I know I did.”</p>
<p>Ryoka spun wildly, searching for the origin of the horn call. There was nothing. Just the darkness, closing in. She stared back at the fire.</p>
<p>So dark. It was almost completely dark. If it were regular night, Ryoka wouldn’t have ever seen the last glimmer of flame in the coals. But here, there were things darker than black. That she could still see meant there was light.</p>
<p>“Hurry, traveler. If the fire goes out, you are lost. We are lost.”</p>
<p>She knew it was true. Ryoka felt something behind her. She stared at the three. If she drew close they would touch her. But what other choice did she have?</p>
<p>There was something behind her. Not just something. Many things.</p>
<p>“Okay. Okay! I’ll…”</p>
<p>She stumbled towards the fire, away from the darkness. The three smiled as Ryoka drew closer. They reached for her, but before she drew in range of their hands, Ryoka stopped.</p>
<p>“Don’t—don’t touch me.”</p>
<p>“But we want to.”</p>
<p>“Yes, come close. Just a bit closer.”</p>
<p>Ryoka drew back. She knew the things were right behind her now, but she <em>could not be touched.</em> She grabbed for a piece of wood. She just needed to put it on the fire, but the hands…</p>
<p>“I’ll start the fire again. But if you touch me I’ll put out the fire and we’ll all be in the dark. Understand?”</p>
<p>She heard something like a sigh. But the hands withdrew. It was the old woman’s voice, rotted and sighing that addressed Ryoka next.</p>
<p>“Very well. We have time. But hurry.”</p>
<p>Ryoka knew she had moments. She flung the wood on the fire and desperately knelt by it, trying to rekindle the flames. She grabbed at the potions at her belt, threw them onto the flames. She thought she felt a touch on her sh—</p>
<p>The flames burst into life, high and fierce. Ryoka fell back as the fire roared into life. The alchemist’s fire burned bright, but was already fading. Ryoka hurried to toss wood on the flames as the three sighed and drew closer to the life-giving flames once more.</p>
<p>At last, the fire was stoked. This time Ryoka built it high, tossing almost all the wood she had onto it. It could not go out.</p>
<p>The three sat so close to the flames that they licked at their forms. Now Ryoka looked again, the old woman and the young warrior looked…normal. Their skin was intact, and when they spoke it was with soft, gentle voices. But Ryoka knew what she had seen.</p>
<p>“So. The fire is kindled. But it will not last through the night.”</p>
<p>“No. You have not enough wood. Not enough fuel.”</p>
<p>It was true. Ryoka only had a stick of wood in her hands. And the fire was already dying. The darkness was sucking it away. The storm was engulfing the light.</p>
<p>Again, the hands reached for her.</p>
<p>“We can keep them at bay.”</p>
<p>“We can protect you. Touch us.”</p>
<p><em>Touch them.</em></p>
<p>Ryoka shuddered. She took a step back and glanced into the darkness. Things looked back at her.</p>
<p>“She wavers again. And again.”</p>
<p>The old woman sighed. But then she smiled. She looked sideways at the third thing and then spoke to Ryoka.</p>
<p>“My companion has a gift for you.”</p>
<p>“A…gift?”</p>
<p>Ryoka started, looking at the thing that sat next to the old woman and the young one. But yes. It hadn’t moved, but now it held something. It reached out to Ryoka, and she knew it wanted to place it in her hand.</p>
<p>“Go on. Take it. It is a gift, freely offered.”</p>
<p>The two sat back. Something had changed. Ryoka hesitated as she drew near the third.</p>
<p>“What if I don’t want the gift?”</p>
<p>“You must take it. It is ill luck to refuse a gift.”</p>
<p>Neither woman reached for her, despite being near to the fire. Ryoka hesitated, but part of her wanted to know. She held her hand out, palm up, and the thing—</p>
<p>Something landed in Ryoka’s palm. She stumbled back as the other two sat up, reaching for her again. Something was in Ryoka’s hand. Something cold and…what was it?</p>
<p>It was familiar. Ryoka stared down at her palm as she drew nearer to the fire. She couldn’t go too far away or…</p>
<p>The light illuminated two pale, long things in Ryoka’s palm. She thought they were worms, but they were too odd. Too different. What were they? She edged a bit closer to the light and then she realized what they were.</p>
<p><em>Fingers. Two fingers, curled up in the center of her hand.</em></p>
<p>She stared down at the fingers in her hand. They were pale with the cold, but familiar. Long and slender, tanned from being out in the sun. And at the place where they ended—</p>
<p><em>Torn flesh. Bite marks.</em> Ryoka could see bone on the end of one of the fingers. It had been ripped away from its hand. She shuddered, and her hand, her right hand with its two missing fingers throbbed. She curled her hand—</p>
<p>And the fingers <em>moved.</em> They curled up. Ryoka jerked. She stared at them, and slowly uncurled her hand. On her palm, the two fingers uncurled slowly.</p>
<p>“A fitting gift.”</p>
<p>The dried voice made Ryoka look up. The old woman was staring at her, smiling wide.</p>
<p>“Are you not pleased? Is it not what you have lost?”</p>
<p>“I—”</p>
<p>The fingers lay in Ryoka’s palm. She hesitated. Ryoka wanted nothing more than to throw them away, but she remembered what the old woman and Ivolethe had said. So she shoved them into a pocket, feeling them move as she did.</p>
<p>“Now, child. It is time to choose.”</p>
<p>They reached out again. And this time Ryoka knew there was no choice. The fire was fading.</p>
<p>Ryoka stared at the hands. She stared at the darkness. Both were horrific. Both were…</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>She said it out loud. The three looked at her. She heard a sigh.</p>
<p>“No? So you choose the storm and the dark. It is not better, traveller. Not better at all.”</p>
<p>The young woman shook her head as she said that. But Ryoka shook her head as well.</p>
<p>“No. I choose the third option. I choose this.”</p>
<p>She had the wooden stick in her hand. Ryoka stuck it into the fire, keeping her distance from the things that reached for her. The end of the stick ignited, and Ryoka pulled a flaming torch out.</p>
<p>The three stared at her, all disappointed. The old woman spoke.</p>
<p>“You will not escape the darkness with that. The flame will go out very soon.”</p>
<p>“Better that than staying here.”</p>
<p>Ryoka stepped back from the fire. She stared at the three things, huddled around the flames.</p>
<p>“You’re welcome to the fire. But I won’t join you. And I won’t get lost in the darkness.”</p>
<p>“So you say. But you had better hurry, child. Your time is running out.”</p>
<p>Already the flame was burning down the stick. Ryoka turned and ran. She ran away from the fire, into the complete darkness around her. She knew things were following her, reaching for her and recoiling from the flame. But she ran and ran, knowing what was behind her was just as bad.</p>
<p>The three sat at the fire, huddling around it as the flames burnt down. And then the fire went out.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>—-</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Erin reached for the horn. But her hand paused. She turned to the umbrella, and then back to the horn. When she reached out the second time, it was for the umbrella.</p>
<p>The man with the beard smiled as Erin picked it up. He reached for her, but she handed the umbrella to him.</p>
<p>“Here. I’m sorry. But I can’t take it.”</p>
<p>He blinked, surprised. Erin picked up the noose and unwrapped it from the beam. She handed it to the man with the book, and then picked up the horn. She stared at it for a long time and then handed it to the dancing man. All three held their gifts and looked at her.</p>
<p>“Will you not choose one? Do you not wish for any?”</p>
<p>“I want all three.”</p>
<p>Erin said it and meant every word. She wanted all three gifts with a passion she couldn’t describe. She would have given anything for them, even her soul. But—</p>
<p>“But I’m afraid I can’t take any of them. You see, I don’t think I should have them.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>They stared at her. Erin smiled as she tried to explain.</p>
<p>“They’re not for someone like me. You see…I’m just an innkeeper. I’m no warrior. I don’t fight battles. I don’t have enemies. And I have enough light. I’m afraid someone else might find more use for them than me.”</p>
<p>The three men held their gifts, priceless beyond words, as Erin bowed her head.</p>
<p>“Sorry. But I’ll have to refuse.”</p>
<p>The first to speak was the man with the beard. He laughed, and the laughter filled the room. He turned to the others and they laughed too, as one. When he was done, he stood before her, grave.</p>
<p>“So. Three times we have offered and you have refused.”</p>
<p>He pointed at Erin, standing tall and proud.</p>
<p><strong>“</strong>Not for pride, she declines.”</p>
<p>The man with the book opened it and wrote in it.</p>
<p>“Not for knowledge she says no.”</p>
<p>And the third man stared at Erin and sighed wistfully.</p>
<p>“Not for others she refuses. So it must be.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Erin felt bad, but the man with the beard smiled at her.</p>
<p>“It must be. And you have chosen. Innkeeper, I thank you for your hospitality. One day we may meet again. Until that day, I offer you my thanks.”</p>
<p>“And I.”</p>
<p>The man with the book bowed slightly.</p>
<p>“And I.”</p>
<p>The dancing man gave Erin a bow more graceful than a moonbeam. She smiled at them all.</p>
<p>“Thank you. Come back whenever you want. I’ll be happy to serve you again.”</p>
<p>They laughed again at that, as if she’d told another fine joke. And then the man with the beard turned to the fire. He pointed.</p>
<p>“Keep it lit. The night is not over, innkeeper.”</p>
<p>Erin turned. The fire had grown very low. She piled more wood on it, and it blazed brightly. She was about to thank the man for pointing that out. But he was gone.</p>
<p>She turned and they were gone. The three men had vanished without a trace. But in their place, something glinted at the table where they’d sat. Erin went over to it. She reached down and slowly picked up a coin.</p>
<p>It was palm-sized, and looked a bit like silver. But brighter. Whiter. If it was metal, it was none that Erin knew. She lifted it and felt the weight of it in her palm. It was light as a feather.</p>
<p>What to do with it? Erin stared at the coin, and then walked into the kitchen. She looked around and saw the small jar Lyonette kept separate from the main stash. In a dream she put the coin the men had left in the small pot of coins. Then Erin went back to the fire.</p>
<p>It was low, now, despite all the fuel she’d added. Erin curled up next to it, staring at the flames. Her encounter with the three men seemed more like a dream, now. She didn’t even know if it had happened. Erin stared into the heart of the flames and felt a deep exhaustion fall over her. She closed her eyes. In moments, she was asleep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#787878;">It was dark. Ryoka ran through the darkness, heart pounding. She couldn’t feel anything, couldn’t see. It was too dark.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#787878;">There were things around her. They reached for her with appendages. Some were hands. Others were…different. They grasped at her, trying to pull her back. But Ryoka ran on, and the light in her hands pushed them back, kept them at bay.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#575757;">But the light was fading. As Ryoka ran, it slowly burnt away, fading into the blackness. Ryoka ran on, searching for a way out. But there was nothing around her. No sign of escape.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#575757;">Just the night.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">“Is anyone there? Someone! Please!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Ryoka screamed as she ran. There had to be something. Some sign that there was life—something else but the darkness. But all she heard was her own voice, and the things closing in.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Her breath was tearing at her lungs. Ryoka had run so far, but now the torch was a flickering stub. She slowed, trying to cradle the fire as the wind threatened to blow it out. And still there was nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0c0e0e;">Nothing…Ryoka closed her eyes. Something was next to her. It reached for her, and she knew it was over. She saw the last flicker of light die.</span></p>
<p>“Ryoka!”</p>
<p><span style="color:#0c0e0e;">And then there was light. Ryoka turned in the darkness and ran for it, ran for the voice that cut through the howling oblivion around her. She turned, searching for the source of the voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0c0e0e;">“Ivolethe?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">“Ryoka! Come to my voice!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Ryoka ran. She ran towards the sound of the voice in the darkness. There was nothing around her. Nothing, and yet the things reached for her, trying to touch her. To…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Ryoka felt something tugging at her neck. She cried out, but the thing hadn’t touched her. It had tangled on her scarf and was trying to pull her back. She fought to get free and the scarf tore loose from its grip. She ran away, towards the voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#575757;">There was light. Faint, in the distance, but as absolute as certainty. In this darkness, even the faintest glimmer was unmistakable. Ryoka ran towards it, shouting and hearing her name called again and again.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#575757;">“I’m here! Here!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#787878;">Again, she heard the call and this time Ryoka threw everything she had into the run. She ran fast, faster than she’d ever run in her life. There was nothing that held her back. If her legs broke, if her body tore and bled—if she fell just a step behind, the things would catch her, and there would be nothing of Ryoka after that.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#787878;">Now she could see someone running towards her. Ryoka saw a shape, a…woman?</span></p>
<p>“Ryoka!”</p>
<p>The voice was familiar, but the person was not. Ryoka only caught a glimpse as she ran, but the woman was tall, as tall as Ryoka and lithe. She held something in her hands that shone in the darkness.</p>
<p>A sword. She ran and Ryoka ran with her.</p>
<p>“This way! Do not look back, no matter what! Run.”</p>
<p>“Ivolethe?”</p>
<p>“<em>Run,</em> fool!”</p>
<p>The sword flashed as the woman swung it behind Ryoka. And Ryoka ran. She ran, and the darkness followed her. But there was light up ahead. Light and—</p>
<p>And movement. Something ran towards her. Ryoka saw something dash by her. A man? No. Not a man. But someone in armor nonetheless, a…being with a sword that had the same unnatural radiance as his face. It was a he, and he ran past Ryoka.</p>
<p>A warrior. But he was not the only one. Ryoka heard galloping hooves, and cries that made her ears ring. Not one, but many beings ran past her, each one male, or so she thought. They ran towards the darkness and kept it at bay. And she ran and ran—</p>
<p>And burst out into the light. Not the light of day, but rather the light of midnight. There were no stars in the sky and the sun had long set. The clouds were thick and it was snowing and the moon was obscured.</p>
<p>But it was <em>light.</em> Ryoka sank to her knees in the snow, gasping, and then saw the blue radiance flying towards her, and heard her name being called.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Ryoka! Ryoka Griffin!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ivolethe!”</p>
<p>Ryoka struggled to her feet and ran to the faerie. Ivolethe flew towards Ryoka, and the girl cupped her hands so the faerie could land in them.</p>
<p>“How did you find me?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Never mind that. Did they touch you? Did anything touch you?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe was looking Ryoka up and down anxiously. The girl shook her head.</p>
<p>“Nothing. What was—what—”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Do not speak of it. Do not mention what was there, lest you call it.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivolethe put a finger as cold as frost itself to Ryoka’s lips warningly. The girl closed her mouth. Ivolethe studied Ryoka and shook her head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Build a fire. You are near death.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She was. Ryoka looked around for wood, but nearly fell. She could barely feel her limbs. Ivolethe flew off as Ryoka had to sit. She came back with wood and dumped it on the ground. Then the faerie stared at the wood. The color of her body changed and her body shimmered. For a second her crystal skin and living ice body become molten, and her flesh was burning fire—</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#e01d1d;">“Fire.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And there was. Ryoka pulled herself towards the flames and felt the icy chill around her body fading. She huddled near the flames for a long time, until her clothing was smouldering and she felt blisters forming from the heat. Only then did she roll away and look at herself.</p>
<p>“I—I felt…”</p>
<p>Ryoka touched at her throat and shuddered. Only once had the things nearly caught her. She pulled away her scarf and Ivolethe hissed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Do not touch that!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of the scarf that Mistress Yesel had given Ryoka had…changed. The waving pattern had warped and altered, the fabric’s stitching switching around. Forming the impression of a…hand…</p>
<p>Ryoka shuddered as she stared at the impression in the fabric. She tore the scarf away and hurled it into the fire. She grimly watched it burn, and then remembered the second horror of the night.</p>
<p>The girl reached into her pocket, hoping that she would find nothing. But her heart chilled as she touched something at the bottom of her pocket.</p>
<p>“That was no dream.”</p>
<p>She pulled out two twitching digits. Her fingers. Ivolethe’s eyes went wide and she flew back from the fingers. Ryoka stared at them. She tried to clench her hand and watched the fingers curl up.</p>
<p>“What the hell was that, Ivolethe?”</p>
<p>The faerie had no answer for Ryoka. None she could give. She stared at Ryoka with mouth tightly closed, staring at the fingers. Ryoka stared at them too.</p>
<p>They were her fingers. She could feel them. If she touched them, she felt the sensation, as if her fingers were back again. But they had been given to her by…by…</p>
<p>They were her fingers. No. They had been. But they weren’t anymore. Ryoka’s hand shook as she lifted the fingers, clutched them tightly. She closed her eyes.</p>
<p>And the she hurled them into the burning fire.</p>
<p>Ivolethe saw Ryoka react as the fingers hit the burning coals, sending up a cloud of sparks. She heard a scream. The girl cried out and doubled over, clutching at the stumps of her fingers. She straightened slowly, gritting her teeth so hard that Ivolethe could hear the grinding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#8ae8ff;">“Are ye well, Ryoka Griffin?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryoka tasted blood. She felt…she turned away from the fire.</p>
<p>“It’s…nothing. Let’s go. I want to be away from this place. Now.”</p>
<p>Ivolethe nodded silently. Ryoka took off running and the faerie flew ahead. Ryoka left the second fire to die down as she ran through the snow. Her right hand burned and the pain nearly made her pass out. But she kept running, on and on, away from this place. Back towards Invrisil.</p>
<p>And she didn’t look back. Not once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Erin? <em>Erin!</em>”</p>
<p>Erin woke up slowly, to someone shaking her.</p>
<p>“Huh? What’s that? Lyonette?”</p>
<p>The girl was shaking Erin, looking worried. As Erin woke up, she realized her inn was full again. There was lots of people standing around her.</p>
<p>Her guests. Her friends. Zel and the Horns of Hammerad and Griffon Hunt and the Halfseekers…</p>
<p>And Lyonette. And Mrsha. The Gnoll licked at Erin’s face as the young woman sat up.</p>
<p>“What’s happening, everyone?”</p>
<p>“You tell us. Erin, what happened to the kitchen?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>It took Erin a few seconds to get up and go to the kitchen. When she did, she could only stare.</p>
<p>The kitchen was empty. Not of people, but of food. All the food in the kitchen was gone. Erin stared at the empty pantry, the ransacked larder, and then at the dishes piled up, and the unwashed pots and pans.</p>
<p>“Did you eat it? All of it?”</p>
<p>Lyonette stared at Erin uncertainly. The girl shook her head.</p>
<p>“No, I—I had a dream, but—”</p>
<p>“You ate everything in your dream?”</p>
<p>Revi stared at Erin incredulously. Ceria shook her head.</p>
<p>“No way. You could have fed us all for days with all the food in there! There’s no way…where did it go?”</p>
<p>Erin had no answers. She only shook her head and stared. After a while, when no answers were forthcoming, the people around her took action.</p>
<p>“I’ll get some food from the city! I mean, I’ll buy some—no, it’s an emergency.”</p>
<p>Lyonette ran out the door and the adventurers who were hungriest went with her to carry things. They left Erin alone, standing in the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Was it just a dream?”</p>
<p>It had felt so real. And yet, Erin felt like the events <em>had</em> to be a dream. Surely it couldn’t be—</p>
<p>Her eyes turned towards the jar of coins at the side of the room. Erin went over to it. Lyonette had grabbed a big handful out in a hurry. So it probably wasn’t…</p>
<p>There. At the bottom of the jar, Erin’s fingers found something other than the regular coins. She slowly drew out a coin that shone white and silver, practically glowing in the light from one of the lamps.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a dream.”</p>
<p>But then, what was it? Erin stared at the coin. She ran her finger over it and peered at it. There was some sort of inscription on the coin. There was a rough border on both sides…faded imagery…she thought there might have been words, too.</p>
<p>But it was all long gone. Only the metal remained. Erin stared down at it, and then slowly put the coin in her pocket.</p>
<p>She walked over to the windows. Someone, probably Lyonette, had thrown them open. Through the glass, Erin stared out into the night.</p>
<p>“Oh. The snow’s stopped.”</p>
<p>The snow had indeed stopped falling. The drifts of snow were piled up very high, but now the sky was clear. And Erin could look up and see the stars and moon. And the second moon, a sliver of a crescent hanging across the sky from the first. Two moons. Sometimes Erin forgot. They hung in the sky, beautiful, lighting up the world.</p>
<p>Behind her, the fire crackled, burning brightly in the fireplace. Erin ignored it as she stared out across the vast world, up into a universe that was not hers.</p>
<p>But it was hers now, wasn’t it? Erin sighed and saw the windows fog up. Her windows. And this was her inn.</p>
<p>Around her, the snow covered the plains, deep, white. Untouched. To the right the city of Liscor sat, dark, the walls staring down at her. But familiar, nonetheless.</p>
<p>Erin reached into her pocket and felt the coin again. Was it just a small thing? No. Today had meant something, she was certain. It was the end of the winter. The winter solstice. The thing she had been named after.</p>
<p>Something had happened. Even if she didn’t know what. And looking out into the world, Erin knew more things were happening.</p>
<p>The winter was ending. The shortest day and the longest night of the year was over. Soon the world would warm, and then…</p>
<p>Erin smiled. Oh, that was right. If the longest night of the year was over, didn’t that technically make today sort of a new year’s? It was close enough, right? Perhaps that was how this world celebrated such things.</p>
<p>It certainly seemed fitting. Erin wiped at the glass and saw a group of people trudging back towards her inn, carrying what looked like enough food to feed an army. Or a bunch of starving adventurers.</p>
<p>It was just a short moment, but Erin was finally alone. She felt loneliness in her heart, and sadness. And grief. But also hope, and the reassurance that came to her as she stared at the people coming towards her inn.</p>
<p>She wasn’t completely alone. And so Erin walked towards her door and threw it open. She smiled as the night passed into day and the next day began. Everything started today. She laughed as, in the distance, the sun stopped setting and began to rise.</p>
<p>“It looks like it’s going to be an interesting year.”</p>

<p><strong>End of Volume 3.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s so much to say. There’s so much I want to say. Let’s begin with the most important stuff for you and then move on. After today, I’m going to take a <strong>week long break from writing The Wandering Inn.</strong></p>
<p>That simply means I’ll post the next chapter on Saturday, January 6th, 2018 (or Tuesday, January 9th for public readers). I wanted to time this just right, so that any of you Patreon folks don’t get blindsided and pledge for January while missing a week of updates.</p>
<p>But I’ll get to that in a second. For now, let’s talk about the third volume ending. It feels like just yesterday I was writing Laken’s first chapter, but here we are again. It feels like all that time went so quickly, and yet what a year it’s been for everyone. For the world.</p>
<p>And for me. In one year I went from working a part-time job to self-employment. Which is why it’s odd that I’m taking a break, isn’t it? But this is the first moment I feel like I can truly relax. I have enough money that if some people unsubscribe I won’t be in trouble. And in truth…I need a break.</p>
<p>Just a small one. Here’s the thing. I’ve said that I write both chapters a week in one day, over the course of six or more hours. That’s not a lot of working time if you just counted that, but I spend a lot of time I never measure thinking about what the next chapter will be. Every time I walk, as I’m about to sleep…the chapter consumes my day.</p>
<p>It’s necessary and I don’t mind it. But of late, and especially with the last few chapters leading to the end of Volume 3, I’ve felt like I lost a tiny bit of my edge. I felt like some chapters I could have written a bit better, or I missed certain details. And I just grew tired of writing 10,000+ words twice a week.</p>
<p>In this industry, and I mean that of any online work, web comics, web serials, Youtubers and so forth, you hear a lot about burnout. My goal with the week off is to avoid that ever happening. I’m not bored of the story. Never of the story. But I don’t <em>like</em> writing. I like telling stories. Writing is just the thing I do to facilitate that process. So I’d like a break. Just for one week, and then I think I can write for an entire year without pausing.</p>
<p>Enough about breaks. I’ll enjoy myself and I hope I can count on you to come back. Let’s talk about the story. Volume 3 did feel like set up for other things, but we got good characters and some nice moments, didn’t we? And yet…Volume 4 will be different. Or so I hope.</p>
<p>Let me put it this way. I feel when writing The Wandering Inn as though there are certain types of plots I write. One type is the main plot, the story of stories that I know. I know how it will end, but it moves slow. The second type follows main characters like Erin and Ryoka, the way they interact. The third is individual, and follows Ceria, Pisces, and every character I’ve written.</p>
<p>Mixing and focusing on each type of story makes the volume slow, but it also creates a localized world within the world, a place readers know very well. That’s all good, but there is a larger plot. And so for Volume 4, I think we’ll be seeing the story of the world move forwards. At last, the events that will be marked in history books will take place. Volume 4…should be good.</p>
<p>That’s all for now. I’ve rambled on quite long enough. I can only make the same promise I always do to you: next chapter will be even better. I’ll write my best, and hope that you continue to support me. I’ll see you in a week’s time. Thanks for supporting The Wandering Inn and see you next year.</p>
